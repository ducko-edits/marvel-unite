### Will you make more seasons with movies and series that take place after Avengers: Endgame?

> Endgame will mark the end of Marvel: Unite because it's a perfect conclusion to the narrative told up to that point.
> 
> A sequel series with post-Endgame content is possible, but it would be a difficult task considering the sheer volume of content. Plot threads from TV series would need to be trimmed down and folded in, and a lot of bloated, subpar content from the films would need to be cut, too. Frankly, it gives me a migraine just thinking about trying to make something coherent out of it all.
> 
> I was motivated to work on Unite because I knew that the payoff in Endgame was worth it. Maybe Avengers 6 will come out in however many years and blow everyone away, but until then, I don't have any plans to continue the series past Endgame.

### How do I download these to my computer?

> Downloads are available via torrent. Torrenting allows for high-speed secure downloads, which will never be taken down as long as the community continues [seeding](https://help.bittorrent.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000023347-what-is-seeding-).
>
> Simply copy and paste the magnet link from the [downloads](/downloads/) page into a Bittorrent program like [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/). After the download is finished, leave the program running so other users can download the files from you.

### Will you make Blu-ray ISOs?

> Maybe, but it's not a priority for me. Hit me up if you have experience making custom Blu-ray menus.
