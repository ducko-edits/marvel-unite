### Will you make more seasons with movies and series that take place after Avengers: Endgame?

> Endgame will mark the end of Marvel: Unite because it's a perfect conclusion to the narrative told up to that point.
> 
> A sequel series with post-Endgame content is possible, but it would be a difficult task considering the sheer volume of content. Plot threads from TV series would probably need to be folded in. Frankly, a lot of the content is bloated and subpar, and would need to be cut. None of this sounds very enticing to me, personally.
> 
> I was motivated to work on Unite because I knew that the payoff in Endgame was worth it. Maybe Secret Wars will come out in a few years and blow everyone away, but until then, I don't have any plans to continue the series past Endgame.

### How do I download these to my computer?

> All download links are found on the individual season pages.
> 
> The lowest quality versions can be downloaded directly from archive.org.
> 
> Higher quality versions are available via torrent. Torrenting allows for high-speed secure downloads, which will never be taken down as long as the community continues [seeding](https://help.bittorrent.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000023347-what-is-seeding-). Simply copy and paste the magnet link from the season page into a Bittorrent program like [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), and then leave the program running so other users can download the files from you.

### Will you make Blu-ray ISOs?

> Maybe, but it's not a priority for me. Main thing holding me back is that I have very little experience putting together custom Blu-ray menus, and I'm not really in a big hurry to learn.
