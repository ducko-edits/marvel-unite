# FAQ

### Will you make more seasons with movies and series that take place after Avengers: Endgame?

Endgame will mark the end of Marvel: Unite because it's a perfect conclusion to the narrative told up to that point.

A sequel series with post-Endgame content is possible, but it would be a difficult task considering the sheer volume of content. Plot threads from TV series would probably need to be folded in. Frankly, a lot of the content is bloated and subpar, and would need to be cut. None of this sounds very enticing to me, personally.

I was motivated to work on Unite because I knew that the payoff in Endgame was worth it. Maybe Secret Wars will come out in a few years and blow everyone away, but until then, I don't have any plans to continue the series past Endgame.

### Will you make Blu-ray ISOs?

Maybe, but it's not a priority for me. Main thing holding me back is that I have very little experience putting together custom Blu-ray menus, and I'm not really in a big hurry to learn.
