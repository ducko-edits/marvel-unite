### How do I download these to my computer?

> Downloads are available via torrent. Torrenting allows for high-speed secure downloads, which will never be taken down as long as the community continues [seeding](https://help.bittorrent.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000023347-what-is-seeding-).
>
> Simply copy and paste the magnet link from the [downloads](/downloads/) page into a Bittorrent program like [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/). After the download is finished, leave the program running so other users can download the files from you.

### Why wasn't The Incredible Hulk (2008) included?

> The main reason is it just doesn't connect very well to the other films -- continuity-wise or thematically. It doesn't really present any information that's critical to the Infinity War saga, and Hulk unfortunately becomes a more minor character without any standalone film sequels. I firmly believe that the film's inclusion would be more confusing than beneficial.
>
> The Avengers does a decent job of introducing Mark Ruffalo's Hulk, anyway.

### Will you make more seasons with the movies and series that take place after Avengers: Endgame?

> **Endgame will mark the end of Marvel: Unite because it's a perfect conclusion to the narrative told up to that point.**
> 
> A sequel series with post-Endgame content is possible, but it would be a difficult task considering the sheer volume of content. Plot threads from TV series would need to be trimmed down and folded in, and a lot of bloated, subpar content from the films would need to be cut, too. Frankly, it gives me a migraine just thinking about trying to make something coherent out of it all.
> 
> I was motivated to work on Unite because I knew that the payoff in Endgame was worth it. Maybe Avengers 6 will come out in however many years and blow everyone away, but until then, **I don't have any plans to continue the series past Endgame**.

### Does this series incorporate the IMAX versions with expanded aspect ratio?

> The first two seasons are almost entirely in regular 2.35:1 scope. The only film with IMAX scenes in the first two seasons is the first Iron Man, but I've decided against including those for consistency and simplicity. However, the episodes covering The Avengers retain its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.
>
> Starting in Season 3 and onwards, all of the films have IMAX available, so **this edit will contain IMAX sequences whenever reasonable**. This does result in a lot of changing aspect ratios, but I've worked carefully to make these transitions smooth and organic. I was also delighted to find that the vast majority of IMAX shots actually line up perfectly with the original scope shots. The higher quality Blu-ray sources are actually overlaid on top of the IMAX sources for most shots, ensuring the highest quality source is always used.

### Will you make Blu-ray ISOs?

> Maybe, but it's not a priority for me. Hit me up if you have experience making custom Blu-ray menus.
