00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:48.128
Give me the wheel!

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:57.012

<i>Communications array damaged.</i>

00:01:59.097 --> 00:02:00.140

- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:57.669
- Great speech, man!
- I got you, pal.

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.439
I gave a speech? How was it?

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:00.795
- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:01.910
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:02.990
It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:04.958
- Where are we going?
- Uh, to town, on each other.

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:06.076
Probably back in your room

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:07.275
because I also want to
see your research.

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:08.350
Okay, you can see my research,

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:10.397
but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:11.709
Mr Stark.

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:12.756
Ho Yinsen.

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:13.830
Ah, I finally met a man called "Ho."

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:14.916
Come here.

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:18.232
I would like to
introduce you to our guest, Dr Wu.

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:19.795
- Oh, this guy. Hey.
- Mr Stark.

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:21.790
You're a heart doctor.

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:24.196
She's going to need
a cardiologist after I...

00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:28.918
- Bye.
- Perhaps another time?

00:06:31.286 --> 00:06:33.095
Mr Stark!

00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:34.970
Oh, wow! Hey, Tony!

00:06:35.806 --> 00:06:38.650
Aldrich Killian.
I'm a big fan of your work.

00:06:38.926 --> 00:06:39.927
- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.

00:06:40.286 --> 00:06:42.527
Well, of course, but, Ms Hansen,

00:06:42.686 --> 00:06:46.054
my organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:47.207
Yeah, we're full.

00:06:48.046 --> 00:06:49.696
Oh, wow, he made it.
He made the cut.

00:06:49.846 --> 00:06:50.927
What floor you going to, pal?

00:06:51.006 --> 00:06:52.496
Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.

00:06:52.686 --> 00:06:53.767
The ground floor, actually,

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:55.769
of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

00:06:55.966 --> 00:06:59.687
It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.

00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:01.337
- Uh...
- She'll take both.

00:07:01.446 --> 00:07:03.687
One to throw away and one to not call.

00:07:03.846 --> 00:07:07.453
"Advanced Idea Mechanics"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:10.006
- I see that, because it's on your T-shirt.
- Aw!

00:07:10.486 --> 00:07:12.693
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:14.450
Thank you, I'll call you.

00:07:17.206 --> 00:07:19.413
I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.

00:07:19.566 --> 00:07:20.727
- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.

00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:22.566
I'll see you up
on the roof in five minutes.

00:07:22.606 --> 00:07:24.176
Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.

00:07:24.246 --> 00:07:25.327
You know what I'm talking about?

00:07:25.406 --> 00:07:26.407
I'll see you up there.

00:07:26.566 --> 00:07:27.897
Damn betcha.

00:07:27.916 --> 00:07:30.362
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.

00:07:30.556 --> 00:07:31.762
Well, it was.

00:07:31.836 --> 00:07:33.565
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

00:07:33.636 --> 00:07:34.637
- that governs repair...
- Wow.

00:07:34.716 --> 00:07:36.077
...and chemically recode it.

00:07:36.116 --> 00:07:38.562
That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...

00:07:38.636 --> 00:07:39.757
...operating system...

00:07:39.796 --> 00:07:41.236
- ...of a living organism.
- Exactly.

00:07:41.516 --> 00:07:42.597
- Yes.
- Wow.

00:07:42.676 --> 00:07:43.677
Is that...
Can you...

00:07:43.756 --> 00:07:45.281
- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?

00:07:45.436 --> 00:07:47.086
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...

00:07:47.276 --> 00:07:49.165
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.

00:07:49.516 --> 00:07:51.280
- Happy...
- Hmm. That's cute...

00:07:51.356 --> 00:07:52.801
Leave her ficus alone.

00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:53.963
Because...
And, no, seriously, don't.

00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:55.037
And you're starting with plants.

00:07:55.156 --> 00:07:56.157
- For now, yeah.
- Huh.

00:07:56.316 --> 00:07:58.478
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.

00:07:59.956 --> 00:08:01.196
- Well, it's...
- Human application.

00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:02.482
Exactly, exactly.

00:08:02.756 --> 00:08:04.676
- Dendritic revitalisation.
- It's revolutionary.

00:08:04.796 --> 00:08:06.082
- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.

00:08:06.156 --> 00:08:07.646
...even limb regrowth.

00:08:09.076 --> 00:08:10.521
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.

00:08:10.676 --> 00:08:11.837
Wow.

00:08:11.916 --> 00:08:14.522
- In Switzerland.
- Hmm. That's better.

00:08:14.596 --> 00:08:16.598
- Aw, you're seeing things.
- This week.

00:08:16.836 --> 00:08:18.725
You almost
bought it, didn't you?

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.360
This is what I'm talking about,
the glitch.

00:08:31.436 --> 00:08:32.722
Have you checked
the telomerase algorithm?

00:08:32.876 --> 00:08:33.923
- The what?
- Down!

00:08:34.436 --> 00:08:36.359
Stay down! Stay down, boss.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.006
- We're good.
- Stay down.

00:08:38.156 --> 00:08:40.204
You... You're...
You're right on me. I made it.

00:08:41.276 --> 00:08:42.437
What the hell was that?

00:08:44.116 --> 00:08:45.845
- What was that?
- It's a glitch in my work. It's...

00:08:46.156 --> 00:08:47.487
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

00:08:47.676 --> 00:08:48.623
It's not Y2K.

00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:50.310
Hey! Happy New Year!

00:08:50.466 --> 00:08:51.627
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:53.072
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.

00:08:53.146 --> 00:08:54.227
- You good?
- Yeah.

00:08:54.306 --> 00:08:55.786
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.

00:09:45.939 --> 00:09:49.192
So sweet. That is so nice.

00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:51.194
Hi.

00:09:51.444 --> 00:09:52.612
I got to go, though.

00:09:53.404 --> 00:09:54.614
Okay. Bye.

00:09:55.782 --> 00:09:57.408
My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.161
Yeah.

00:10:01.788 --> 00:10:02.830
Hey, if you want...

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:05.208
If you want,
you're welcome to use my machine.

00:10:05.416 --> 00:10:06.960
Might be cheaper than
the one in the basement.

00:10:07.877 --> 00:10:09.295
Yeah? What's it cost?

00:10:10.254 --> 00:10:11.965
A cup of coffee?

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:16.386
Thank you, but

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.638
I already have a load in downstairs,

00:10:18.846 --> 00:10:21.683
and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.

00:10:21.891 --> 00:10:24.894
I just finished a rotation
in the infectious disease ward, so...

00:10:25.103 --> 00:10:27.063
Well, I'll keep my distance.

00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:28.398
Hopefully, not too far.

00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:32.944
And I think you left your stereo on.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.030
Right. Thank you.

00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:37.240
Yeah.

00:11:23.036 --> 00:11:24.787
I don't remember giving you a key.

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:28.791
You really think I'd need one?

00:11:30.793 --> 00:11:32.420
My wife kicked me out.

00:11:34.005 --> 00:11:35.256
I didn't know you were married.

00:11:36.883 --> 00:11:38.968
A lot of things you don't know about me.

00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:41.637
I know, Nick. That's the problem.

00:11:56.319 --> 00:11:59.781
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.

00:12:07.038 --> 00:12:08.456
Who else knows about your wife?

00:12:11.167 --> 00:12:12.293
Just...

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:16.631
My friends.

00:12:16.923 --> 00:12:18.382
Is that what we are?

00:12:19.092 --> 00:12:20.468
That's up to you.

00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:42.448
Don't trust anyone.

00:12:45.493 --> 00:12:46.536
Captain Rogers?

00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:49.580
Captain,

00:12:49.872 --> 00:12:51.874
I'm Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Special Service.

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:53.209
Kate?

00:12:54.836 --> 00:12:55.920
I'm assigned to protect you.

00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:57.296
On whose order?

00:12:58.548 --> 00:12:59.549
His.

00:13:04.746 --> 00:13:06.164
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.

00:13:06.373 --> 00:13:07.374
I need EMTs.

00:13:07.582 --> 00:13:09.084
<i>Do we have a 20 on the shooter?</i>

00:13:09.793 --> 00:13:11.086
Tell him I'm in pursuit.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.158
You're late.

00:14:17.242 --> 00:14:20.496
Merriment can sometimes be
a heavier burden than battle.

00:14:20.662 --> 00:14:22.164
Then you're doing
one of them incorrectly.

00:14:23.082 --> 00:14:25.000
Perhaps.

00:14:25.167 --> 00:14:27.002
How fare the stars?

00:14:27.169 --> 00:14:28.837
Still shining.

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:31.799
From here, I can see nine realms
and ten trillion souls.

00:14:36.678 --> 00:14:39.431
Do you recall what I taught you
of the Convergence?

00:14:39.598 --> 00:14:40.682
Yes.

00:14:40.933 --> 00:14:43.185
The alignment of the worlds.

00:14:43.352 --> 00:14:45.062
It approaches, doesn't it?

00:14:45.312 --> 00:14:49.191
The universe hasn't seen this marvel
since before my watch began.

00:14:50.234 --> 00:14:53.445
Few can sense it.
Even fewer can see it.

00:14:54.863 --> 00:14:57.407
But while its effects can be dangerous,

00:14:58.242 --> 00:15:01.078
it is truly beautiful.

00:15:02.371 --> 00:15:03.831
I see nothing.

00:15:03.914 --> 00:15:07.543
Or, perhaps,
that is not the beauty you seek.

00:15:13.382 --> 00:15:14.716
How is she?

00:15:14.883 --> 00:15:16.802
She's quite clever, your mortal.

00:15:16.927 --> 00:15:18.178
She doesn't know it yet,

00:15:18.262 --> 00:15:20.764
but she studies
the Convergence as well.

00:15:20.931 --> 00:15:22.141
Even...

00:15:23.892 --> 00:15:25.310
What?

00:15:28.147 --> 00:15:29.565
I can't see her.

00:16:01.988 --> 00:16:03.198
Is he gonna make it?

00:16:03.281 --> 00:16:04.741
I don't know.

00:16:06.368 --> 00:16:07.786
Tell me about the shooter.

00:16:07.994 --> 00:16:10.121
He's fast. Strong.

00:16:13.083 --> 00:16:14.334
Had a metal arm.

00:16:19.673 --> 00:16:20.924
Ballistics?

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.011
Three slugs, no rifling.
Completely untraceable.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.471
Soviet-made.

00:16:27.472 --> 00:16:28.473
Yeah.

00:16:29.558 --> 00:16:30.767
He's in V-tach.

00:16:30.976 --> 00:16:32.644
- Crash cart coming in.
- Nurse, help me with the drape.

00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:33.979
- BP's dropping.
- Defibrillator!

00:16:36.815 --> 00:16:38.233
I want you to charge him at 100.

00:16:38.441 --> 00:16:39.818
Don't do this to me, Nick.

00:16:40.026 --> 00:16:41.278
Stand back.

00:16:41.528 --> 00:16:42.654
Three, two,

00:16:42.988 --> 00:16:44.573
one. Clear.

00:16:46.032 --> 00:16:47.409
- Pulse?
- No pulse.

00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:48.827
Okay, 200, please.

00:16:48.952 --> 00:16:50.036
Stand back!

00:16:50.245 --> 00:16:52.497
Three, two, one. Clear!

00:16:52.622 --> 00:16:53.665
Get me epinephrine!

00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:55.917
Pulse?

00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:57.002
Negative.

00:16:59.713 --> 00:17:01.673
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:22.986
What's the time?

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.154
1:03, Doctor.

00:17:26.364 --> 00:17:29.034
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.

00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:08.114
I need to take him.

00:18:22.087 --> 00:18:23.171
Natasha.

00:18:37.018 --> 00:18:38.061
Natasha!

00:18:39.729 --> 00:18:40.980
Why was Fury in your apartment?

00:18:43.108 --> 00:18:44.109
I don't know.

00:18:44.317 --> 00:18:45.777
Cap, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:18:46.403 --> 00:18:47.445
Yeah, give me a second.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:48.571
They want you now.

00:18:49.906 --> 00:18:51.241
Okay.

00:18:54.411 --> 00:18:56.496
You're a terrible liar.

<i>back to S.H.I.E.L.D.
immediately for questioning.</i>

00:19:06.965 --> 00:19:08.425
I told him.

00:19:15.557 --> 00:19:16.933
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

00:19:18.685 --> 00:19:19.769
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.

00:19:49.844 --> 00:19:51.209
Can you regulate?

00:19:51.364 --> 00:19:52.331
Yes, I can regulate.

00:19:52.404 --> 00:19:53.530
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

00:20:04.084 --> 00:20:05.495
It's a decent batch.

00:20:06.964 --> 00:20:09.044
- Don't say I never did nothing for you.
- Thank you.

00:20:11.364 --> 00:20:13.526
I mean, for understanding.

00:20:22.084 --> 00:20:23.085

00:20:39.124 --> 00:20:40.489

00:20:43.604 --> 00:20:45.368
Yeah, a little movie

00:20:47.404 --> 00:20:48.405
Here's the ticket.

00:20:49.284 --> 00:20:50.845
No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.

00:21:17.284 --> 00:21:18.331

00:23:44.514 --> 00:23:45.766
Neighbor.

00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:49.519
Captain.

00:23:49.978 --> 00:23:50.979
I'm Alexander Pierce.

00:23:51.605 --> 00:23:53.023
Sir, it's an honor.

00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:54.274
The honor's mine, Captain.

00:23:54.483 --> 00:23:56.943
My father served in the 101 st.
Come on in.

00:23:58.236 --> 00:24:00.739
That photo was taken five years
after Nick and I met,

00:24:00.947 --> 00:24:03.325
when I was at State Department in Bogota.

00:24:03.533 --> 00:24:05.994
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

00:24:06.203 --> 00:24:10.457
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:14.127
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

00:24:14.294 --> 00:24:15.587
and he comes to me with a plan.

00:24:15.796 --> 00:24:17.631
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.

00:24:17.839 --> 00:24:20.592
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

00:24:21.635 --> 00:24:25.180
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:27.516
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

00:24:27.724 --> 00:24:29.142
They find it empty.

00:24:30.394 --> 00:24:32.229
Nick had ignored my direct order,

00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:35.774
and carried out an unauthorized
military operation on foreign soil,

00:24:36.483 --> 00:24:38.568
and saved the lives of a dozen
political officers,

00:24:38.902 --> 00:24:39.986
including my daughter.

00:24:40.153 --> 00:24:41.738
So you gave him a promotion.

00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:43.490
I've never had any cause to regret it.

00:24:45.742 --> 00:24:47.786
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

00:24:51.873 --> 00:24:52.958
I don't know.

00:24:54.209 --> 00:24:55.544
Did you know it was bugged?

00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:58.755
I did, because Nick told me.

00:24:59.256 --> 00:25:01.716
Did he tell you he was
the one who bugged it?

00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:09.683
I want you to see something.

00:25:10.642 --> 00:25:11.852
<i>Who hired you, Batroc?</i>

00:25:12.185 --> 00:25:13.145
Is that live?

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.898
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

00:25:18.024 --> 00:25:21.194
Are you saying he's a suspect?
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

00:25:21.611 --> 00:25:24.197
No, no. It's more complicated than that.

00:25:24.364 --> 00:25:26.950
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the <i>Lemurian Star</i>.

00:25:27.159 --> 00:25:30.662
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

00:25:31.371 --> 00:25:35.250
and then the money was run
through 17 fictitious accounts.

00:25:35.876 --> 00:25:37.711
The last one going to a holding company

00:25:37.878 --> 00:25:40.088
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

00:25:40.297 --> 00:25:41.590
Am I supposed to know who that is?

00:25:41.798 --> 00:25:43.800
Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

00:25:44.217 --> 00:25:46.928
His last address was 1435 Elmhurst Drive.

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:50.974
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

00:25:52.642 --> 00:25:55.937
Are you saying Fury
hired the pirates? Why?

00:25:56.438 --> 00:25:58.106
The prevailing theory

00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:01.985
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

00:26:02.194 --> 00:26:04.571
and sale of classified intelligence.

00:26:06.406 --> 00:26:09.201
The sale went sour and
that led to Nick's death.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:15.123
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:18.460
Why do you think we're talking?

00:26:22.088 --> 00:26:24.633
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

00:26:24.841 --> 00:26:28.595
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

00:26:30.096 --> 00:26:34.392
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

00:26:35.227 --> 00:26:37.604
to build a really better world

00:26:38.313 --> 00:26:41.483
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.

00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:45.153
And that makes enemies.

00:26:47.447 --> 00:26:50.325
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts

00:26:50.534 --> 00:26:53.286
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.

00:26:54.704 --> 00:26:57.374
And the idea that those people
could be happy today

00:26:58.833 --> 00:27:01.294
makes me really, really angry.

00:27:05.382 --> 00:27:07.551
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

00:27:07.634 --> 00:27:09.636
I don't think that's an accident.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.805
And I don't think you do, either.

00:27:14.057 --> 00:27:15.850
So, I'm gonna ask again.

00:27:16.226 --> 00:27:18.061
Why was he there?

00:27:20.981 --> 00:27:23.275
He told me not to trust anyone.

00:27:25.527 --> 00:27:27.737
I wonder if that included him.

00:27:32.576 --> 00:27:33.827
I'm sorry.

00:27:33.994 --> 00:27:35.287
Those were his last words.

00:27:36.913 --> 00:27:38.123
Excuse me.

00:27:41.585 --> 00:27:43.003
Captain,

00:27:43.211 --> 00:27:46.214
somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

00:27:47.257 --> 00:27:49.676
Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.

00:27:51.052 --> 00:27:52.429
Anyone.

00:27:55.348 --> 00:27:56.808

No, let's wait and see what it is first.

00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:43.453

00:28:55.214 --> 00:28:57.008

I'm sorry about what happened with Fury.

00:29:12.565 --> 00:29:14.525
It's messed up, what happened to him.

does anyone want to get out?

00:30:31.936 --> 00:30:33.688
Mobilize S.T.R.I.K.E. units, 25th floor.

Whoa, big guy.

00:30:51.455 --> 00:30:54.125
I just want you to know, Cap,
this isn't personal!

00:31:05.886 --> 00:31:07.013
It kind of feels personal.

00:31:16.022 --> 00:31:18.024
Drop the shield
and put your hands in the air!

00:31:34.749 --> 00:31:37.209
Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open!

00:31:37.627 --> 00:31:39.045
You have nowhere to go!

00:31:58.898 --> 00:31:59.982
Are you kidding me?

00:32:00.066 --> 00:32:02.193

<i>Repeat, stand down.</i>

00:33:07.874 --> 00:33:09.000
- Hi.
- Oh!

00:33:09.274 --> 00:33:10.958
Do you mind leaving that on?

00:33:11.674 --> 00:33:12.835
Sure.

00:33:18.954 --> 00:33:23.278
Sunday nights. PBS. <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

00:33:24.074 --> 00:33:26.998
That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.

00:33:29.754 --> 00:33:31.722
One more thing. Make sure
everyone wears their badges.

00:33:31.794 --> 00:33:33.000
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.

00:33:33.074 --> 00:33:36.203
Plus, my guys
won't let anyone in without them.

00:33:36.274 --> 00:33:38.322
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.

00:33:38.394 --> 00:33:40.034
We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...

00:33:40.074 --> 00:33:41.678
His reaction
to the latest attack.

00:33:41.874 --> 00:33:43.675
Mr Stark, hi there.

00:33:44.274 --> 00:33:47.676
Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.

00:33:48.314 --> 00:33:49.884
Anything else you can tell us?

00:33:49.954 --> 00:33:52.958
Hey, Mr Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?

00:33:53.794 --> 00:33:54.795
I'm just saying.

00:33:57.914 --> 00:33:59.962
Is that what you want?

00:34:02.154 --> 00:34:03.804
Here's a little holiday greeting

00:34:03.914 --> 00:34:06.315
I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.

00:34:06.394 --> 00:34:08.795
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.

00:34:09.474 --> 00:34:12.523
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.

00:34:12.594 --> 00:34:15.677
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided

00:34:16.474 --> 00:34:17.999
that you just died, pal.

00:34:18.514 --> 00:34:20.198
I'm gonna come get the body.

00:34:20.514 --> 00:34:23.040
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.

00:34:23.674 --> 00:34:26.359
There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.

00:34:26.674 --> 00:34:30.281
And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.

00:34:30.354 --> 00:34:33.836
10880 Malibu Point.

00:34:33.914 --> 00:34:36.121
90265.

00:34:36.194 --> 00:34:38.037
I'll leave the door unlocked.

00:34:38.114 --> 00:34:39.314
That's what you wanted, right?

00:34:42.594 --> 00:34:44.198
Bill me.

00:35:11.605 --> 00:35:12.981
Jane!

00:35:13.565 --> 00:35:14.858
Where the hell were you?

00:35:15.191 --> 00:35:16.610
Tell me you didn't call the police.

00:35:16.693 --> 00:35:17.819
What was I supposed to do?

00:35:17.944 --> 00:35:19.738
- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.

00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:21.031
You call the cops, they call the Feds.

00:35:21.114 --> 00:35:23.033
Next thing you know,
we have S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over

00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:24.701
- "Area 51-ing" the place.
- Jane.

00:35:24.784 --> 00:35:26.870
We had a stable gravitation anomaly.

00:35:26.953 --> 00:35:28.246
We had unimpeded access.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.874
Our only competition
was ten years old!

00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:32.584
Jane! You were gone for five hours.

00:35:33.126 --> 00:35:34.419
What?

00:35:41.217 --> 00:35:42.886
That's weird.

00:36:04.449 --> 00:36:05.867
Typical.

00:36:06.618 --> 00:36:07.661
Jane.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:13.083
Sorry. I just needed
to make sure you were real.

00:36:13.249 --> 00:36:14.751
It's been a very strange day.

00:36:14.918 --> 00:36:16.419
I am. Jane, what...

00:36:16.836 --> 00:36:17.879
Where were you?

00:36:18.088 --> 00:36:19.089
Where were you?

00:36:20.006 --> 00:36:21.341
Heimdall cannot see you.

00:36:21.508 --> 00:36:23.259
I was right here where you left me.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.595
I was waiting,
and then I was crying

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.263
and then I went out looking for you.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:28.973
You said you were coming back.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.476
I know. I know,
but the Bifrost was destroyed.

00:36:31.643 --> 00:36:33.186
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.

00:36:33.311 --> 00:36:35.480
Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.

00:36:36.022 --> 00:36:37.649
I had to put an end
to the slaughter.

00:36:39.234 --> 00:36:42.987
As excuses go, it's not terrible.

00:36:43.071 --> 00:36:45.907
But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!

00:36:46.825 --> 00:36:49.536
Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world

00:36:49.619 --> 00:36:51.413
but I was wrong.

00:36:51.579 --> 00:36:53.456
I was a fool.

00:36:54.332 --> 00:36:57.794
But I believe that fate
brought us together.

00:36:59.879 --> 00:37:02.924
Jane, I don't know where you were,
or what happened, but I do know this...

00:37:03.758 --> 00:37:04.759
What?

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.053
I know...

00:37:08.263 --> 00:37:09.389
You do?

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:11.975
Do what?

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.727
What?

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:15.311
Hey!

00:37:17.063 --> 00:37:18.523
Is this you?

00:37:22.902 --> 00:37:24.320
We're kind of in the middle
of something here.

00:37:24.738 --> 00:37:27.407
I'm pretty sure
we are getting arrested.

00:37:27.657 --> 00:37:28.658
Hold that thought.

00:37:30.076 --> 00:37:33.663
Look at you,
still all muscly and everything.

00:37:33.747 --> 00:37:35.415
How's space?

00:37:35.498 --> 00:37:37.625
Space is fine.

00:37:37.751 --> 00:37:39.002
Excuse me.

00:37:39.169 --> 00:37:40.253
- Are you Jane Foster?
- Yes.

00:37:40.336 --> 00:37:41.337
Do you know this man?

00:37:42.881 --> 00:37:44.007
He's my intern.

00:37:45.175 --> 00:37:46.342
My intern's intern.

00:37:46.468 --> 00:37:48.470
This is private property and
you're trespassing, the lot of you.

00:37:48.553 --> 00:37:49.846
You'll have to come with me.

00:37:55.643 --> 00:37:56.644
Jane.

00:37:57.437 --> 00:37:59.397
- Jane.
- Thor?

00:37:59.731 --> 00:38:00.732
Are you all right?

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.108
What just happened?

00:38:02.692 --> 00:38:05.195
Place your hands on your heads.
Step back.

00:38:05.278 --> 00:38:06.321
This woman is unwell.

00:38:06.404 --> 00:38:07.405
She's dangerous.

00:38:08.406 --> 00:38:09.741
So am I.

00:38:10.742 --> 00:38:12.869
Requesting armed
response officers to scene.

00:38:13.244 --> 00:38:14.871
- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?

00:38:23.213 --> 00:38:25.256
Holy shit.

00:38:52.742 --> 00:38:54.786
We have to do that again.

00:38:55.245 --> 00:38:56.246
Hi.

00:38:59.082 --> 00:39:01.251
Welcome to Asgard.

00:39:03.116 --> 00:39:06.325
<i>I've compiled
a Mandarin database for you, sir,</i>

00:39:06.436 --> 00:39:10.646
<i>drawn from
S.H.I.E.L.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.</i>

00:39:10.716 --> 00:39:13.287
<i>Initiating virtual crime scene
reconstruction.</i>

00:39:15.436 --> 00:39:19.236
Okay. What have we got here?

00:39:19.316 --> 00:39:23.640
The name is an ancient Chinese war
mantle meaning "advisor to the king."

00:39:23.716 --> 00:39:27.038
South American insurgency tactics.

00:39:27.116 --> 00:39:29.562
Talks like a Baptist preacher.

00:39:29.636 --> 00:39:34.005
There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theatre. Close.

00:39:34.076 --> 00:39:37.637
<i>The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3, 000 degrees Celsius.</i>

00:39:37.756 --> 00:39:41.363
<i>Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporised instantly.</i>

00:39:41.436 --> 00:39:44.121
No bomb parts found in a three-mile
radius of the Chinese Theatre?

00:39:44.196 --> 00:39:45.197
<i>No, sir.</i>

00:39:47.236 --> 00:39:48.237
Talk to me, Happy.

00:40:07.036 --> 00:40:08.879
When is a bomb not a bomb?

00:40:20.276 --> 00:40:21.641
Any military victims?

00:40:21.716 --> 00:40:23.957
<i>Not according to public record, sir.</i>

00:40:24.036 --> 00:40:26.164
Bring up the thermogenic
signatures again.

00:40:26.236 --> 00:40:27.965
Factor in 3,000 degrees.

00:40:28.036 --> 00:40:30.767
<i>The Oracle cloud
has completed analysis.</i>

00:40:30.836 --> 00:40:31.917
<i>Accessing satellites</i>

00:40:31.996 --> 00:40:35.887
<i>and plotting the last 12 months
of thermogenic occurrences now.</i>

00:40:36.556 --> 00:40:39.002
Take away everywhere
that there's been a Mandarin attack.

00:40:44.836 --> 00:40:46.076
Nope.

00:40:51.356 --> 00:40:53.597
That. Are you sure
that's not one of his?

00:40:53.676 --> 00:40:56.156
<i>It predates any known Mandarin attack.</i>

00:40:56.236 --> 00:40:59.080
<i>The incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide.</i>

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:00.999
Bring her around.

00:41:01.716 --> 00:41:04.083
<i>The heat signature
is remarkably similar.</i>

00:41:04.756 --> 00:41:06.201
<i>3,000 degree Celsius.</i>

00:41:07.996 --> 00:41:10.078
That's two military guys.

00:41:10.876 --> 00:41:12.116
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

00:41:12.556 --> 00:41:15.036
<i>Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.</i>

00:41:21.036 --> 00:41:22.117
Are we still at ding-dong?

00:41:22.236 --> 00:41:24.637
We're supposed to be on total...

00:41:24.716 --> 00:41:25.842
...security lockdown.

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:27.757
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

00:41:28.916 --> 00:41:30.486
<i>There's only so much I can do, sir,</i>

00:41:30.556 --> 00:41:34.481
<i>when you give the world's press
your home address.</i>

00:41:43.876 --> 00:41:45.765
Right there is fine.

00:41:49.636 --> 00:41:51.479
You're not the Mandarin.

00:41:51.556 --> 00:41:53.638
Are you? Are you?

00:41:55.156 --> 00:41:56.806
You don't remember.

00:41:56.876 --> 00:41:58.002
Why am I not surprised?

00:41:58.196 --> 00:42:00.358
Don't take it personally. I don't
remember what I had for breakfast.

00:42:00.436 --> 00:42:01.881
<i>Gluten-free waffles, sir.</i>

00:42:01.956 --> 00:42:03.287
That's right.

00:42:03.476 --> 00:42:06.286
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.

00:42:06.356 --> 00:42:07.357
It's urgent.

00:42:09.316 --> 00:42:13.640
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.

00:42:13.716 --> 00:42:14.763
It's...

00:42:16.116 --> 00:42:17.606
- With her.
- Tony?

00:42:18.956 --> 00:42:20.242
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah,

00:42:20.316 --> 00:42:22.159
- it's Maya Hansen.
- Ah...

00:42:22.436 --> 00:42:24.279
Old botanist pal

00:42:24.356 --> 00:42:26.757
that I used to know, barely.

00:42:26.956 --> 00:42:28.526
Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid

00:42:28.636 --> 00:42:29.717
waiting in the car that I've never met.

00:42:29.796 --> 00:42:30.797
He's 13.

00:42:30.876 --> 00:42:32.685
No, I need your help.

00:42:32.756 --> 00:42:34.326
But, what for? Why now?

00:42:34.396 --> 00:42:37.684
Because I read the papers and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

00:42:37.756 --> 00:42:38.803
I'll be fine.

00:42:39.196 --> 00:42:40.197
I'm sorry,
with Happy in the hospital,

00:42:40.316 --> 00:42:42.364
I didn't know we were expecting guests.

00:42:42.436 --> 00:42:44.325
- We weren't.
- And old girlfriends.

00:42:44.396 --> 00:42:46.125
- She's not, really.
- No, not really. I...

00:42:46.236 --> 00:42:49.399
- it was just one night.
- Yep.

00:42:49.476 --> 00:42:51.205
That's how you did it, isn't it?

00:42:51.276 --> 00:42:53.597
- It was a great night.
- Yep. Well, you know.

00:42:53.676 --> 00:42:55.599
- You saved yourself a world of pain.
- What?

00:42:55.676 --> 00:42:57.280
- I'm sure.
- Trust me. We're going out of town.

00:42:57.356 --> 00:42:58.357
Okay. We've been through this.

00:42:58.436 --> 00:42:59.483
- Nope.
- Yep!

00:42:59.556 --> 00:43:01.516
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.

00:43:01.596 --> 00:43:03.157
- Honey...
- Great idea. Let's go.

00:43:03.196 --> 00:43:05.847
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:07.406
This is how normal people behave.

00:43:07.596 --> 00:43:09.678
I can't protect you out there.

00:43:09.756 --> 00:43:11.599
Is... Is that normal?

00:43:11.796 --> 00:43:13.844
- Sadly, that is very normal.
- Yes, this is normal!

00:43:13.916 --> 00:43:15.566
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!

00:43:15.916 --> 00:43:16.963
Calm down.

00:43:17.036 --> 00:43:18.925
- I got this for you.
- I'm aware of that.

00:43:19.036 --> 00:43:20.367
You still haven't even
told me you liked it.

00:43:20.436 --> 00:43:21.722
I don't like it.

00:43:21.796 --> 00:43:22.797
I asked you three...
You don't like it.

00:43:23.036 --> 00:43:24.083
- We are leaving the house.
- Guys?

00:43:24.156 --> 00:43:25.282
That's not even up for discussion.

00:43:25.356 --> 00:43:27.563
- Can we, um...
- I said no. What?

00:43:27.636 --> 00:43:28.876
Do we need to worry about that?

00:44:18.356 --> 00:44:19.357
I got you.

00:44:19.596 --> 00:44:21.598
I got you first.

00:44:21.676 --> 00:44:23.041
Like I said, we can't stay here.

00:44:30.756 --> 00:44:31.757
Oh!

00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:34.407
Move! I'm right behind you.

00:44:34.876 --> 00:44:36.401
Oh!

00:44:38.636 --> 00:44:40.116
Get her. I'm gonna find a way around.

00:44:40.996 --> 00:44:42.441
Stop stopping. Get her. Get outside.

00:44:43.236 --> 00:44:44.567
Go!

00:45:06.916 --> 00:45:08.645
Ch, my God. Tony!

00:45:22.916 --> 00:45:25.806
<i>Sir, Ms Potts
is clear of the structure.</i>

00:45:57.916 --> 00:45:59.247
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

00:45:59.396 --> 00:46:01.364
<i>Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.</i>

00:46:16.356 --> 00:46:17.482
That's one.

00:46:19.516 --> 00:46:21.996
<i>Sir, the suit is not combat ready.</i>

00:46:37.876 --> 00:46:39.082
That's two.

00:46:42.876 --> 00:46:43.877
Oh.

00:47:51.916 --> 00:47:53.964
Tony!

00:48:27.677 --> 00:48:29.361
<i>Sir, take a deep breath.</i>

00:48:44.877 --> 00:48:46.925
<i>Flight power restored.</i>

00:49:03.922 --> 00:49:04.923
What's that?

00:49:05.007 --> 00:49:06.049
Be still.

00:49:13.598 --> 00:49:15.976
This is not of Earth. What is it?

00:49:16.768 --> 00:49:18.437
We do not know.

00:49:19.146 --> 00:49:23.108
But she will not survive the amount
of energy surging within her.

00:49:28.655 --> 00:49:30.282
That's a quantum field
generator, isn't it?

00:49:30.949 --> 00:49:32.784
It's a soul forge.

00:49:32.909 --> 00:49:36.121
Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?

00:49:38.999 --> 00:49:40.042
Yes.

00:49:40.167 --> 00:49:41.918
Quantum field generator.

00:49:43.045 --> 00:49:45.964
My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?

00:49:46.131 --> 00:49:47.257
She is ill.

00:49:47.382 --> 00:49:49.634
She is mortal.

00:49:49.801 --> 00:49:51.344
Illness is their defining trait.

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:53.096
I brought her here
because we can help her.

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.098
She does not belong here in Asgard

00:49:55.265 --> 00:49:58.643
any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:00.395
Did he just...

00:50:00.479 --> 00:50:02.064
Who do you think you are?

00:50:02.147 --> 00:50:04.691
I am Odin, King of Asgard.

00:50:04.858 --> 00:50:06.401
Protector of the Nine Realms.

00:50:08.153 --> 00:50:09.196
Well, I'm...

00:50:09.321 --> 00:50:12.157
I know very well who you are,
Jane Foster.

00:50:13.116 --> 00:50:14.493
You told your dad about me?

00:50:15.368 --> 00:50:16.828
Something is within her, Father.

00:50:16.953 --> 00:50:18.121
Something I have not seen before.

00:50:18.288 --> 00:50:19.498
Her world has its healers.

00:50:19.623 --> 00:50:21.500
They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.

00:50:21.666 --> 00:50:23.460
Guards, take her back to Midgard.

00:50:24.836 --> 00:50:26.338
No, I would not...

00:50:28.173 --> 00:50:29.257
...touch her.

00:50:29.382 --> 00:50:30.675
Jane, are you all right?

00:50:31.218 --> 00:50:32.344
Yeah.

00:50:36.056 --> 00:50:37.307
It's impossible.

00:50:38.517 --> 00:50:41.269
The infection... It's defending her.

00:50:41.895 --> 00:50:43.188
No.

00:50:43.688 --> 00:50:45.357
It's defending itself.

00:50:46.399 --> 00:50:48.401
Come with me.

00:50:48.527 --> 00:50:52.322
There are relics that pre-date
the universe itself.

00:50:52.489 --> 00:50:56.368
What lies within her
appears to be one of them.

00:50:57.369 --> 00:50:59.871
The Nine Realms are not eternal.

00:51:00.038 --> 00:51:01.206
They had a dawn

00:51:01.373 --> 00:51:02.541
as they will have a dusk.

00:51:03.875 --> 00:51:04.876
But before that dawn

00:51:05.043 --> 00:51:11.383
the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.

00:51:13.343 --> 00:51:14.636
"Born of eternal night

00:51:14.761 --> 00:51:17.597
"the Dark Elves come
to steal away the light."

00:51:18.056 --> 00:51:21.476
I know these stories.
Mother told them to us as children.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.813
Their leader Malekith made
a weapon out of that darkness

00:51:24.896 --> 00:51:26.481
and it was called the Aether.

00:51:26.565 --> 00:51:29.609
While the other relics
often appear as stones

00:51:29.693 --> 00:51:32.362
the Aether is fluid and everchanging.

00:51:32.529 --> 00:51:35.115
It changes matter into dark matter.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.827
It seeks out host bodies,
drawing strength from their life-force.

00:51:40.078 --> 00:51:43.039
Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power

00:51:43.206 --> 00:51:46.960
to return the universe
to one of darkness.

00:51:47.627 --> 00:51:50.255
But, after eternities of bloodshed

00:51:50.338 --> 00:51:52.924
my father Bor finally triumphed

00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:57.596
ushering in a peace that
lasted thousands of years.

00:51:58.597 --> 00:51:59.764
What happened?

00:52:01.057 --> 00:52:02.976
He killed them all.

00:52:03.101 --> 00:52:05.270
Are you certain?

00:52:05.353 --> 00:52:07.355
The Aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,

00:52:07.439 --> 00:52:08.690
and yet here it is.

00:52:10.108 --> 00:52:12.277
The Dark Elves are dead.

00:53:15.628 --> 00:53:17.129
Eyes here.

00:53:17.296 --> 00:53:19.173
Whatever your op is, bury it.

00:53:19.382 --> 00:53:20.383
This is Level One.

00:53:20.925 --> 00:53:22.635
Contact DOT.

00:53:22.844 --> 00:53:24.387
All traffic lights in the district go red.

00:53:24.887 --> 00:53:27.014
Shut all runways at BWI,

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.058
IAD and Reagan.

00:53:29.267 --> 00:53:31.894
All security cameras in the city
go through this monitor right here.

00:53:33.104 --> 00:53:34.188
Scan all open sources,

00:53:34.772 --> 00:53:36.107
phones, computers,

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.733
PDAs. Whatever.

00:53:38.568 --> 00:53:39.735
If someone tweets about this guy,

00:53:39.944 --> 00:53:40.987
I want to know about it.

00:53:41.696 --> 00:53:43.239
With all due respect,
if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

00:53:43.489 --> 00:53:46.200
a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

00:53:46.742 --> 00:53:48.119
Because he lied to us.

00:53:49.745 --> 00:53:53.249
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

00:53:53.791 --> 00:53:55.376
He refused to share it.

00:53:56.419 --> 00:53:58.546
As difficult as this is to accept,

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:02.925
Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:54:30.322 --> 00:54:31.365
- Where is it?
- Safe.

00:54:31.532 --> 00:54:33.159
- Do better.
- Where did you get it?

00:54:33.367 --> 00:54:34.618
Why would I tell you?

00:54:34.827 --> 00:54:36.871
Fury gave it to you. Why?

00:54:37.079 --> 00:54:38.456
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

00:54:38.664 --> 00:54:39.665
Stop lying.

00:54:39.874 --> 00:54:41.292
I only act like I know
everything, Rogers.

00:54:42.793 --> 00:54:44.295
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

00:54:45.796 --> 00:54:48.716
Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty,
Fury needed a way in, so do you.

00:54:48.924 --> 00:54:50.134
I'm not gonna ask you again.

00:54:52.011 --> 00:54:53.220
I know who killed Fury.

00:54:57.183 --> 00:54:59.643
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

00:54:59.852 --> 00:55:02.688
The ones that do call him
the Winter Soldier.

00:55:02.897 --> 00:55:04.899
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

00:55:05.107 --> 00:55:06.984
in the last 50 years.

00:55:07.443 --> 00:55:08.986
So he's a ghost story.

00:55:09.361 --> 00:55:12.406
Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

00:55:12.615 --> 00:55:14.909
Somebody shot out my tires near Odessa.

00:55:15.117 --> 00:55:17.369
We lost control,
went straight over a cliff.

00:55:17.578 --> 00:55:18.871
I pulled us out.

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.956
But the Winter Soldier was there.

00:55:21.707 --> 00:55:24.001
I was covering my engineer so he shot him

00:55:24.335 --> 00:55:25.336
straight through me.

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:27.254
Soviet slug.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.466
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

00:55:31.967 --> 00:55:33.844
Yeah, I bet you look
terrible in them now.

00:55:36.597 --> 00:55:39.100
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

00:55:40.476 --> 00:55:42.520
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

00:55:47.399 --> 00:55:49.276
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

00:55:49.359 --> 00:55:50.565
<i>Sir?</i>

00:55:50.879 --> 00:55:52.369
<i>Sir!</i>

00:55:53.039 --> 00:55:55.485
All right, kill the alarm. I got it.

00:55:55.559 --> 00:55:58.529
<i>That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.</i>

00:55:58.599 --> 00:55:59.600
Oh...

00:56:02.039 --> 00:56:03.245
Oh!

00:56:36.599 --> 00:56:39.569
It's snowing, right?
Where are we, upstate?

00:56:39.639 --> 00:56:43.360
<i>We are five miles outside of
Rose Hill, Tennessee.</i>

00:56:43.439 --> 00:56:44.884
Why?

00:56:44.959 --> 00:56:47.610
Jarvis. Not my idea.

00:56:48.319 --> 00:56:50.401
What are we doing here?
This is thousands of miles away!

00:56:50.479 --> 00:56:51.924
I gotta get Pepper.
I gotta...

00:56:52.439 --> 00:56:54.760
<i>I prepared a flight plan.
This was the location.</i>

00:56:54.839 --> 00:56:55.886
Who asked you?

00:56:56.639 --> 00:56:57.919
- Open the suit.
- <i>I...</i>

00:56:57.959 --> 00:56:59.165
<i>I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.</i>

00:56:59.239 --> 00:57:00.240
Open it, J.

00:57:07.399 --> 00:57:08.446
That's brisk.

00:57:16.639 --> 00:57:18.243
Maybe I'll just cosy back up for a...

00:57:18.479 --> 00:57:21.244
<i>I actually think
I need to sleep now, sir.</i>

00:57:21.519 --> 00:57:22.884
Jarvis.

00:57:25.039 --> 00:57:26.484
Jarvis?

00:57:28.999 --> 00:57:31.161
Don't leave me, buddy.
