00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.573
<i>You get this.
It's affordable. It's gorgeous.</i>

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:15.062
<i>It goes with any decor...</i>

00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:19.252
- What happened to picture?
- Go to override.

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.342
- How is this happening again?
- Fine. Override to Los Angeles.

00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:24.412
<i>I'm trying.
There's nothing I can...</i>

00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:25.532
<i>Well, where is
the feed coming from?</i>

00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:27.694
<i>I don't know,
it's in all of our receivers and I...</i>

00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:29.899
The entire East Coast,
the satellites are down.

00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:31.371
It's not just our station.

00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:32.492
What about a backup manual?

00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:34.691
<i>We have an unauthorised
broadcast cutting through...</i>

00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:38.657
Mr Vice President,
I think you should see this.

00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:42.141
Oh, God, not again.

00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:43.937
Is the President getting this?

00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:56.815
<i>Mr President.</i>

00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:59.054
<i>Only two lessons remain.</i>

00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:03.173
<i>And I intend to finish this
before Christmas morning.</i>

00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:06.018
<i>Meet Thomas Richards.</i>

00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:09.254
<i>Good strong name.
Good strong job.</i>

00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:13.856
<i>Thomas, here, is an accountant
for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.</i>

00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:20.177
But I'm sure he's a really good guy.

00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:23.891
I'm going to shoot him in the head,

00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:27.255
live on your television in 30 seconds.

00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:28.457
No!

00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:31.933
The number for this telephone
is in your cell phone.

00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:35.140
Exciting, isn't it,
imagining how it got there?

00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:36.981
<i>America,</i>

00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:40.175
<i>if your president calls me
in the next half-minute,</i>

00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:41.976
<i>Tom lives.</i>

00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:43.052
<i>Go!</i>

00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:46.662
How did he hack my phone?

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.699
We can't allow terrorists to dictate...

00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:50.011
I have to make this call.

00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:51.502
I'd strongly advise against that.

00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:54.177
This is the right thing to do.

00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:23.177
<i>There's just
one lesson left, President Ellis.</i>

00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:25.140
So run away, hide,
kiss your children goodbye.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:26.212
Because nothing,

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:28.771
not your army, not your red, white
and blue attack dog,

00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:30.819
can save you.

00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:35.253
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:40.739
Tell Rhodes,
find this lunatic right now.

00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:42.540
Sir, we tracked
the broadcast signal.

00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:44.454
We have a possible point of origin
in Pakistan

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:45.657
and the Patriot is ready to strike.

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:47.893
- Right now.
- Yes, sir.

00:03:25.603 --> 00:03:29.607
<c.yellow>Heal. You will need your strength
to reclaim the Aether.</c>

00:03:30.108 --> 00:03:33.694
<c.yellow>And when you wake,
we will kill them all.</c>

00:04:10.148 --> 00:04:11.441
Jane Foster?

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.778
You need to come with us.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.115
We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.

00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:20.659
Our artillery cannot detect them.

00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:22.577
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:29.876
My king, we are all but defenseless.

00:04:32.462 --> 00:04:33.922
She's your prisoner now?

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:37.634
Leave us.

00:04:46.643 --> 00:04:48.812
I do not wish to fight with you.

00:04:49.312 --> 00:04:51.064
Nor I with you.

00:04:51.147 --> 00:04:52.983
But I intend to pursue Malekith.

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:54.442
We possess the Aether.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.319
Malekith will come to us.

00:04:56.486 --> 00:04:58.488
Yes, and he will destroy us.

00:04:58.572 --> 00:05:00.699
You overestimate the power
of these creatures.

00:05:00.824 --> 00:05:03.159
No, I value our people's lives.

00:05:03.326 --> 00:05:06.621
I'll take Jane to the Dark World,
and draw the enemy away from Asgard.

00:05:07.372 --> 00:05:09.583
When Malekith pulls
the Aether from Jane,

00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:11.668
it will be exposed and vulnerable.

00:05:11.835 --> 00:05:13.628
And I will destroy it and him.

00:05:15.672 --> 00:05:18.425
If you fail, you risk this weapon

00:05:18.508 --> 00:05:20.343
falling into the hands
of our enemies.

00:05:20.468 --> 00:05:22.846
The risk is far greater
if we do nothing.

00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:24.931
His ship could be over
our heads right now,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.349
we would never even know it.

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:27.684
If and when he comes

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:31.938
his men will fall on 10,000
Asgardian blades.

00:05:32.022 --> 00:05:33.440
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:35.525
As many as are needed!

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:46.036
We will fight!

00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:51.082
Till the last Asgardian breath.

00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:54.919
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.

00:05:57.047 --> 00:06:00.175
Then how are you
different from Malekith?

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:05.972
The difference, my son,
is that I will win.

00:06:32.282 --> 00:06:35.206
Man. Happy, Happy, Happy.

00:06:49.602 --> 00:06:51.252
Don't move!

00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:56.283
Uh...

00:06:57.562 --> 00:06:58.563
Hang on a second.

00:06:59.402 --> 00:07:00.403
Hello?

00:07:00.602 --> 00:07:02.252
You ever have a chick straddling you
and you look up

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:06.168
and suddenly she's glowing from
the inside out, kind of a bright orange?

00:07:06.482 --> 00:07:07.768
Yeah, I've had that.
Who is this?

00:07:07.842 --> 00:07:08.809
<i>It's me, pal.</i>

00:07:08.882 --> 00:07:10.964
Now, last time I went missing,
if I remember correctly,

00:07:11.042 --> 00:07:13.044
you came looking for me.
What are you doing?

00:07:13.202 --> 00:07:14.533
A little knock-and-talk,
making friends in Pakistan.

00:07:14.602 --> 00:07:15.603
What are you doing?

00:07:15.962 --> 00:07:18.806
Your redesign, your big rebrand,
that was AIM, right?

00:07:18.882 --> 00:07:19.883
Yeah.

00:07:21.602 --> 00:07:23.843
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty
comm sat right now, I need your login.

00:07:24.162 --> 00:07:26.210
It's the same as
it's always been, "WarMachine68."

00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:27.329
And password, please.

00:07:27.402 --> 00:07:29.450
Well, look, I gotta change it
every time you hack in, Tony.

00:07:29.602 --> 00:07:31.889
It's not the '80s,
nobody says "hack" any more.

00:07:31.962 --> 00:07:32.963
Give me your login.

00:07:34.562 --> 00:07:37.008
With an all caps.

00:07:40.722 --> 00:07:41.723
Yeah, okay.

00:07:42.002 --> 00:07:45.051
That is so much better
than "Iron Patriot."

00:07:53.442 --> 00:07:54.773
<i>Very nice. Very nice.</i>

00:07:55.002 --> 00:07:57.528
<i>I have one question for you.</i>

00:07:57.642 --> 00:08:00.168
<i>What would you like
for Christmas this year?</i>

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:03.293
<i>Well, David...</i>

00:08:05.522 --> 00:08:10.164
Do not erase a programme from my DVR
unless you are 100% sure...

00:08:15.122 --> 00:08:16.408
<i>One more time!
Ms Elk Ridge, everybody!</i>

00:08:16.482 --> 00:08:17.483
<i>All right.</i>

00:08:19.602 --> 00:08:22.253
Because you erase my shows!

00:08:27.122 --> 00:08:28.123
That ain't gonna cut it.

00:08:28.282 --> 00:08:30.250
We talked about this.

00:08:31.722 --> 00:08:33.850
Excuse me, sir.
I don't know who...

00:08:33.962 --> 00:08:35.646
Shh.

00:08:36.762 --> 00:08:39.202
Morn, I need to call you back.
Something magical is happening.

00:08:40.202 --> 00:08:42.125
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Shh. Keep it down.

00:08:42.202 --> 00:08:43.727
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.

00:08:43.842 --> 00:08:44.963
I knew you were still alive!

00:08:45.482 --> 00:08:47.043
Come on in. Close the door.

00:08:51.562 --> 00:08:52.802
Oh, wow.
Can I just say, sir...

00:08:52.882 --> 00:08:54.008
Yep.

00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:55.963
I am your biggest fan.

00:08:56.122 --> 00:08:58.011
Okay. First, is this your van?
Is anyone else gonna come in?

00:08:58.282 --> 00:08:59.329
No, no, no. Just us.

00:08:59.402 --> 00:09:00.483
Great. What's your name?

00:09:00.602 --> 00:09:02.172
- Gary.
- Gary.

00:09:03.722 --> 00:09:05.292
- Oh, wow.
- Right there is fine.

00:09:05.402 --> 00:09:06.608
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:09:06.682 --> 00:09:07.922
I get a lot of this, it's okay.

00:09:08.202 --> 00:09:10.282
- Oh, good. Can I just say?
- What do you want? Yeah.

00:09:11.002 --> 00:09:13.733
I don't know if you can tell,

00:09:13.802 --> 00:09:15.930
but I have, like, patterned
my whole look after you.

00:09:16.002 --> 00:09:17.413
- My hair's a little...
- It's fine.

00:09:17.522 --> 00:09:19.012
It's not right,
'cause there's no product in it.

00:09:19.202 --> 00:09:20.886
Right.

00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:25.053
I don't want to make things awkward
for you, but I do have to show you...

00:09:25.282 --> 00:09:26.488
Boom!

00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:29.693
A Hispanic Scott Baio.

00:09:29.762 --> 00:09:32.493
- I'm sorry. Is that me?
- Yeah. It's... I mean...

00:09:32.562 --> 00:09:37.329
I had them do it off a doll that I made,
so it's not like it's off a picture.

00:09:37.962 --> 00:09:40.886
- So it's a little bit...
- Gary. Listen to me, okay?

00:09:40.962 --> 00:09:44.887
I don't want to clip your wings, here.
We're both a little over-excited.

00:09:44.962 --> 00:09:46.885
I got an issue.
I'm chasing bad guys.

00:09:46.962 --> 00:09:49.723
I'm trying to grab a little something
from some hard-crypt data files.

00:09:49.762 --> 00:09:50.888
I don't have enough juice.

00:09:51.162 --> 00:09:53.324
I need you to jump on the roof...
Right?

00:09:53.402 --> 00:09:55.609
Recalibrate the ISDNs.

00:09:55.682 --> 00:09:57.730
Pump it up by about 40%.

00:09:58.202 --> 00:09:59.328
- Got it.
- All right? It's a mission.

00:09:59.402 --> 00:10:00.403
Yeah.

00:10:00.482 --> 00:10:02.484
Tony needs Gary.

00:10:02.562 --> 00:10:03.723
And Gary needs Tony.

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:05.167
- Be quiet about it. Go.
- Yeah.

00:10:28.522 --> 00:10:32.208
<i>What would you regard
as the defining moment of your life?</i>

00:10:32.442 --> 00:10:35.563
<i>Well, uh, I think that would be the day
I decided not to let my injury beat me.</i>

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:39.526
<i>Will you please state
your name for the camera?</i>

00:10:39.602 --> 00:10:40.842
<i>Ellen Brandt.</i>

00:10:41.282 --> 00:10:45.287
<i>Okay. So, the injections
are administered periodically.</i>

00:10:45.522 --> 00:10:46.802
<i>Addiction will not be tolerated.</i>

00:10:46.842 --> 00:10:49.812
<i>And those who cannot regulate
will be cut from the programme.</i>

00:10:51.202 --> 00:10:54.046
<i>Once misfits, cripples...</i>

00:10:54.682 --> 00:10:57.811
<i>You are the next iteration
of human evolution.</i>

00:11:02.442 --> 00:11:03.967
<i>Everybody, before we start...</i>

00:11:04.202 --> 00:11:07.251
<i>I promise you, looking back at your life,
there will be nothing as bitter</i>

00:11:07.322 --> 00:11:11.486
<i>as the memory of that glorious risk
you prudently elected to forego.</i>

00:11:11.562 --> 00:11:13.212
<i>Today is your glory.</i>

00:11:13.282 --> 00:11:14.408
<i>Let's begin.</i>

00:11:25.682 --> 00:11:26.968
<i>We gotta get out of here!
We gotta get out of here!</i>

00:11:27.162 --> 00:11:28.483
<i>Get her out!
Get them out of here!</i>

00:11:35.482 --> 00:11:38.326
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

00:11:40.282 --> 00:11:43.047
The stuff doesn't always work.
Right, pal?

00:11:43.122 --> 00:11:45.329
It's faulty,
but you found a buyer, didn't you?

00:11:45.402 --> 00:11:47.769
Sold it to the Mandarin.

00:11:48.322 --> 00:11:50.609
Got you, pal.

00:12:09.624 --> 00:12:10.708
Hey, man.

00:12:10.792 --> 00:12:14.295
I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.

00:12:14.504 --> 00:12:16.130
Everyone we know is trying to kill us.

00:12:19.092 --> 00:12:20.593
Not everyone.

00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:39.237
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:12:48.162 --> 00:12:49.664
What's going on?

00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:56.337
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

00:13:00.174 --> 00:13:03.094
But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.

00:13:08.975 --> 00:13:11.060
I thought I knew
whose lies I was telling,

00:13:14.856 --> 00:13:17.609
but I guess I can't tell
the difference anymore.

00:13:18.651 --> 00:13:20.570
There's a chance you might be
in the wrong business.

00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:26.951
I owe you.

00:13:28.494 --> 00:13:29.537
It's okay.

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:32.290
If it was the other way around,

00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:35.001
and it was down to me to save your life,

00:13:35.209 --> 00:13:36.711
now you be honest with me,

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.757
would you trust me to do it?

00:13:42.925 --> 00:13:43.926
I would now.

00:13:46.971 --> 00:13:48.723
And I'm always honest.

00:13:50.058 --> 00:13:51.184
Well, you seem pretty chipper

00:13:51.392 --> 00:13:53.061
for someone who just found out
they died for nothing.

00:13:53.978 --> 00:13:57.649
Well, guess I just like
to know who I'm fighting.

00:13:58.524 --> 00:13:59.525
I made breakfast.

00:14:00.193 --> 00:14:03.112
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

00:14:04.697 --> 00:14:06.074
So, the question is,

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.242
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

00:14:10.328 --> 00:14:11.329
Pierce.

00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:14.248
Who happens to be sitting on top
of the most secure building in the world.

00:14:14.415 --> 00:14:15.583
But he's not working alone.

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:18.086
Zola's algorithm was on the <i>Lemurian Star</i>.

00:14:19.253 --> 00:14:20.755
So was Jasper Sitwell.

00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:26.719
So, the real question is,
how do the two most wanted people

00:14:26.928 --> 00:14:29.847
in Washington kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D.
officer in broad daylight?

00:14:30.682 --> 00:14:32.558
The answer is, you don't.

00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:35.269
- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.483
Is this Bakhmala?

00:14:40.692 --> 00:14:42.110
The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you?

00:14:43.861 --> 00:14:45.238
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

00:14:47.031 --> 00:14:49.117
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

00:14:49.325 --> 00:14:51.577
I heard they couldn't bring
in the choppers because of the RPGs.

00:14:52.036 --> 00:14:52.995
What did you use? A stealth chute?

00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:54.122
No.

00:14:54.872 --> 00:14:56.290
These.

00:15:01.212 --> 00:15:02.505
I thought you said you were a pilot.

00:15:02.797 --> 00:15:04.132
I never said pilot.

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:09.887
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

00:15:10.513 --> 00:15:11.931
You got out for a good reason.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.641
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.393
There's no better reason to get back in.

00:15:19.147 --> 00:15:20.815
Where can we get our hands
on one of these things?

00:15:21.023 --> 00:15:22.150
The last one is at Fort Meade.

00:15:23.192 --> 00:15:25.695
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.866
Shouldn't be a problem.

00:15:37.585 --> 00:15:39.628
You were not at Odin's war council.

00:15:39.753 --> 00:15:42.089
The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.

00:15:42.298 --> 00:15:43.591
No one is to come

00:15:43.674 --> 00:15:44.967
or to go.

00:15:47.052 --> 00:15:49.763
We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.642
What use is a guardian
such as that?

00:15:55.102 --> 00:15:57.855
Malekith will return, you know this.

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:01.442
I need your help.

00:16:02.067 --> 00:16:05.654
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.

00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:07.406
I'm not asking you to.

00:16:07.615 --> 00:16:09.950
The realms need their Allfather
strong and unchallenged

00:16:10.117 --> 00:16:12.661
whether he is or not.

00:16:12.828 --> 00:16:14.538
But he is blinded, Heimdall

00:16:14.622 --> 00:16:16.373
by hatred and by grief.

00:16:16.457 --> 00:16:18.125
As are we all.

00:16:18.209 --> 00:16:19.418
I see clearly enough.

00:16:19.501 --> 00:16:21.128
The risks are too great.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.131
Everything we do
from here on is a risk.

00:16:24.298 --> 00:16:26.008
There is no other way.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.181
What do you require of me?

00:16:32.306 --> 00:16:35.851
<i>What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.</i>

00:16:36.143 --> 00:16:40.189
<i>Success will bring us exile and
failure shall mean our death.</i>

00:16:43.067 --> 00:16:47.154
<i>Malekith knew the Aether was here.
He can sense its power.</i>

00:16:47.696 --> 00:16:49.865
<i>If we do nothing,
he will come for it again</i>

00:16:50.032 --> 00:16:54.161
<i>but this time,
lay waste to all of Asgard.</i>

00:16:55.162 --> 00:16:57.164
We must move Jane off-world.

00:16:57.331 --> 00:16:58.999
The Bifrost has been shut down

00:16:59.124 --> 00:17:00.834
and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.

00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:05.130
There are other paths off Asgard.
Ways known only to a few.

00:17:05.214 --> 00:17:07.132
One, actually.

00:17:09.218 --> 00:17:10.970
No.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:18.602
Thor. After all this time

00:17:18.686 --> 00:17:21.355
and now you come to visit me.

00:17:22.564 --> 00:17:23.857
Why?

00:17:25.192 --> 00:17:28.237
Have you come to gloat?
To mock?

00:17:28.362 --> 00:17:29.989
Loki, enough.

00:17:30.406 --> 00:17:32.241
No more illusions.

00:17:39.415 --> 00:17:41.500
Now you see me, brother.

00:17:50.217 --> 00:17:51.927
Did she suffer?

00:17:52.052 --> 00:17:54.388
I did not come here
to share our grief.

00:17:54.513 --> 00:17:57.599
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

00:17:59.018 --> 00:18:00.227
Go on.

00:18:00.394 --> 00:18:03.063
I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.

00:18:03.147 --> 00:18:06.108
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.776
Vengeance

00:18:07.943 --> 00:18:10.362
and afterward, this cell.

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:21.915
You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.

00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:25.169
What makes you think
you can trust me?

00:18:25.252 --> 00:18:26.670
I don't.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.465
Mother did.

00:18:30.758 --> 00:18:33.260
But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,

00:18:34.094 --> 00:18:35.554
I did so with a glimmer of hope

00:18:35.637 --> 00:18:37.514
that my brother was still
in there somewhere.

00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:41.602
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.

00:18:42.436 --> 00:18:45.814
You betray me, and I will kill you.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.030
When do we start?

00:18:53.113 --> 00:18:54.448
He will betray you.

00:18:54.531 --> 00:18:56.158
He will try.

00:19:00.746 --> 00:19:03.123
This is so unlike you, brother.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.292
So clandestine.

00:19:05.417 --> 00:19:07.628
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
just punch your way out?

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.297
If you keep speaking, I just might.

00:19:10.422 --> 00:19:12.257
Fine. As you wish.

00:19:12.633 --> 00:19:13.801
I'm not even here.

00:19:15.135 --> 00:19:16.637
Is this better?

00:19:16.804 --> 00:19:19.306
It's better company at least.

00:19:19.431 --> 00:19:23.352
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

00:19:24.937 --> 00:19:27.272
Brother, you look ravishing.

00:19:29.274 --> 00:19:31.819
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.

00:19:31.985 --> 00:19:35.155
Very well. Perhaps you prefer
one of your new companions

00:19:35.322 --> 00:19:37.366
given that you seem
to like them so much.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.952
This is much better.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.997
The costume is a bit much.
So tight.

00:19:44.164 --> 00:19:45.457
But the confidence...

00:19:45.624 --> 00:19:48.043
I can feel the righteousness surging.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.671
Hey, do you want to have
a rousing discussion about truth?

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.339
Honor? Patriotism?

00:19:52.423 --> 00:19:53.424
God bless Amer...

00:19:56.135 --> 00:19:57.469
What?

00:20:01.974 --> 00:20:04.351
You could at least
furnish me with a weapon.

00:20:04.518 --> 00:20:06.395
My dagger, something.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.152
At last.

00:20:13.235 --> 00:20:14.945
A little common sense.

00:20:21.076 --> 00:20:23.620
And I thought you liked tricks.

00:20:23.704 --> 00:20:28.250
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal
is being guarded by a legion of Einherjar

00:20:28.417 --> 00:20:30.169
who will see you coming
from miles away.

00:20:30.252 --> 00:20:31.962
I won't be the one
who comes for her.

00:20:39.761 --> 00:20:40.762
I'm not hungry.

00:20:41.555 --> 00:20:43.307
What the...

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.642
Good. Let's go.

00:20:51.023 --> 00:20:52.065
You're...

00:20:52.232 --> 00:20:54.193
I'm Loki,
you may have heard of me.

00:20:54.276 --> 00:20:56.820
That was for New York.

00:20:56.904 --> 00:20:58.280
I like her.

00:20:58.405 --> 00:21:00.073
<i>And what of the Allfather?</i>

00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:04.453
It is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne.

00:21:04.578 --> 00:21:08.207
You called me here
on an urgent matter.

00:21:09.249 --> 00:21:10.250
What is it?

00:21:10.709 --> 00:21:12.002
Treason, my lord.

00:21:12.085 --> 00:21:13.420
Whose?

00:21:14.129 --> 00:21:15.172
Mine.

00:21:15.923 --> 00:21:17.424
My king!

00:21:17.508 --> 00:21:19.510
The mortal has been taken.

00:21:23.388 --> 00:21:24.389
Stop Thor.

00:21:24.473 --> 00:21:26.600
By any means necessary.

00:21:29.311 --> 00:21:31.813
There they are! Take them.

00:21:31.939 --> 00:21:32.898
On my command.

00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:35.192
I'll hold them off. Take her.

00:21:35.817 --> 00:21:37.236
Thank you.

00:21:39.947 --> 00:21:42.199
Betray him, and I'll kill you.

00:21:44.451 --> 00:21:47.037
It's good to see you, too, Sif.

00:21:52.626 --> 00:21:56.964
Assuming you can get Loki's help
and you can free this mortal

00:21:57.089 --> 00:21:58.590
what good would it do?

00:21:58.674 --> 00:22:01.552
We'd all be dead the minute
we step one foot outside the palace.

00:22:01.635 --> 00:22:04.846
That, my friend,
is why we won't be leaving by foot.

00:22:08.976 --> 00:22:10.727
I will give you as much time as I can.

00:22:10.811 --> 00:22:12.646
Thank you, my friend.

00:22:16.817 --> 00:22:19.987
If you even think
about betraying him...

00:22:20.112 --> 00:22:21.738
You'll kill me?

00:22:21.822 --> 00:22:23.824
Evidently, there will be a line.

00:22:29.497 --> 00:22:31.465
<i>Fun fact.</i>

00:22:31.537 --> 00:22:34.666
<i>Before he built rockets for the Nazis,</i>

00:22:35.137 --> 00:22:39.142
the idealistic Wernher von Braun

00:22:39.457 --> 00:22:41.459
dreamed of space travel.

00:22:42.737 --> 00:22:44.580
He stargazed.

00:22:44.937 --> 00:22:48.419
Do you know what he said when
the first V-2 hit London?

00:22:49.417 --> 00:22:52.864
"The rocket performed perfectly."

00:22:54.777 --> 00:22:57.462
"It just landed on the wrong planet."

00:22:58.337 --> 00:23:03.138
See, we all begin wide-eyed.
Pure science.

00:23:03.777 --> 00:23:08.783
And then the ego steps in,
the obsession.

00:23:09.857 --> 00:23:12.098
And you look up,

00:23:14.057 --> 00:23:16.458
you're a long way from shore.

00:23:16.617 --> 00:23:19.541
You can't be too hard on yourself,
Maya.

00:23:20.137 --> 00:23:22.708
I mean, you gave your research
to a think tank.

00:23:22.777 --> 00:23:26.338
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

00:23:26.617 --> 00:23:28.938
That's exactly what we used to do.

00:23:29.217 --> 00:23:31.265
So, don't judge yourself.

00:23:32.697 --> 00:23:34.745
Thank you, Pepper.

00:23:35.977 --> 00:23:37.741
I really appreciate that.

00:23:45.417 --> 00:23:47.738
- Hi, good evening. Come on in.
- Good evening.

00:23:49.497 --> 00:23:50.908
Maya, run!

00:23:53.377 --> 00:23:54.742
Hi, Pepper.

00:23:56.417 --> 00:23:58.545
So, you want to tell me why you
were at Stark's mansion last night?

00:23:58.937 --> 00:23:59.938
I'm trying to fix this thing.

00:24:00.017 --> 00:24:02.338
I didn't know you and the master
were gonna blow the place up.

00:24:02.417 --> 00:24:05.785
Oh, I see. So, you were trying
to save Stark when he threatened us?

00:24:05.857 --> 00:24:07.746
I've told you, Killian, we can use him.

00:24:09.817 --> 00:24:11.819
Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.

00:24:11.897 --> 00:24:14.867
Look, if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

00:24:14.977 --> 00:24:18.504
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now, he has one.

00:24:23.337 --> 00:24:25.066
<i>This is support team Blue-Zero.</i>

00:24:25.137 --> 00:24:27.822
<i>Sending coordinates for a suspected
Mandarin broadcast point of origin.</i>

00:24:27.897 --> 00:24:28.944
Copy.

00:24:37.057 --> 00:24:38.218
Nobody move.

00:24:42.337 --> 00:24:44.419
Oh. Support Blue-Zero,

00:24:44.577 --> 00:24:46.420
unless the Mandarin's next attack
on the U.S.

00:24:46.497 --> 00:24:48.067
involves cheaply-made sportswear,

00:24:48.337 --> 00:24:50.578
I think you messed up again.

00:24:50.657 --> 00:24:53.501
Yes, you're free, uh,
if you weren't before.

00:24:53.777 --> 00:24:54.824
It's... Of course.

00:24:54.897 --> 00:24:55.898
Yes, ma'am.

00:24:56.097 --> 00:24:57.144
Iron Patriot on the job.

00:24:57.297 --> 00:24:58.298
Happy to help.

00:24:58.497 --> 00:24:59.578
No need to thank me, ma'am.

00:24:59.737 --> 00:25:00.977
It's my pleasure.

00:25:09.097 --> 00:25:11.338
Savin?
I've acquired the Patriot armour.

00:25:11.417 --> 00:25:12.703
If you want this suit,

00:25:12.857 --> 00:25:15.098
you're going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it.

00:25:15.417 --> 00:25:16.907
That's the plan, Colonel.

00:25:19.665 --> 00:25:21.458
Listen, I got to fly home tonight

00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:24.420
because I got some constituency problem

00:25:24.586 --> 00:25:26.505
and I got to press the flesh.

00:25:26.714 --> 00:25:29.008
Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:30.968
No, not really.

00:25:31.927 --> 00:25:33.846
Twenty-three, kind of hot.

00:25:34.471 --> 00:25:35.597
Real hot, you know?

00:25:35.806 --> 00:25:37.933
Wants to be a reporter, I think.
I don't know.

00:25:38.142 --> 00:25:39.143
Who listens at that point?

00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:40.978
Doesn't sound like
much of a problem to me.

00:25:41.186 --> 00:25:43.272
Really? Because she's killing my back.

00:25:44.231 --> 00:25:45.983
But this isn't the place to talk about it.

00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:47.234
This is a nice pin.

00:25:48.527 --> 00:25:50.612
- Thank you.
- Come here.

00:25:51.447 --> 00:25:52.781
Hail HYDRA.

00:25:55.951 --> 00:25:57.786
- See, it's right there...
- Yeah, I just saw that.

00:25:58.704 --> 00:26:00.247
- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.

00:26:09.006 --> 00:26:10.132
I need a minute.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.009
Bring the car around.

00:26:15.637 --> 00:26:16.805
Yes, sir?

00:26:16.889 --> 00:26:18.557
<i>Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?</i>

00:26:18.766 --> 00:26:21.351
<i>I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.</i>

00:26:21.477 --> 00:26:22.519
Who is this?

00:26:22.686 --> 00:26:25.355
<i>The good-looking guy in the sunglasses,
your 10 o'clock.</i>

00:26:27.483 --> 00:26:28.609
<i>Your other 10 o'clock.</i>

00:26:30.486 --> 00:26:31.487
<i>There you go.</i>

00:26:34.323 --> 00:26:35.824
What do you want?

00:26:36.033 --> 00:26:37.826
<i>You're gonna go around
the corner to your right.</i>

00:26:38.035 --> 00:26:40.537
There's a gray car two spaces down.

00:26:40.746 --> 00:26:42.581
You and I are gonna take a ride.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.500
And why would I do that?

00:26:44.666 --> 00:26:47.252
Because that tie looks really expensive,

00:26:47.711 --> 00:26:49.671
<i>and I'd hate to mess it up.</i>

00:26:59.264 --> 00:27:00.516
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.601
Never heard of it.

00:27:02.684 --> 00:27:03.727
What were you doing on the <i>Lemurian Star?</i>

00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:05.521
I was throwing up. I get seasick.

00:27:10.692 --> 00:27:13.904
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.448
Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.

00:27:17.699 --> 00:27:18.700
You're right.

00:27:19.576 --> 00:27:20.619
It's not.

00:27:21.161 --> 00:27:22.162
It's hers.

00:27:26.083 --> 00:27:28.669
Wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...

00:27:29.211 --> 00:27:31.046
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.297
Yeah, she's cute.

00:27:32.381 --> 00:27:33.882
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.

00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:47.813
Zola's algorithm is a program

00:27:49.523 --> 00:27:50.607
for choosing

00:27:50.816 --> 00:27:52.359
- Insight's targets.
- What targets?

00:27:52.734 --> 00:27:53.819
You!

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.197
A TV anchor in Cairo,
the Under Secretary of Defense,

00:27:57.406 --> 00:27:59.825
a high school valedictorian in Iowa City,

00:28:00.075 --> 00:28:01.994
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat

00:28:02.411 --> 00:28:03.996
to HYDRA.

00:28:04.204 --> 00:28:05.914
Now, or in the future.

00:28:06.248 --> 00:28:08.000
In the future? How could it know?

00:28:11.587 --> 00:28:12.629
How could it not?

00:28:14.756 --> 00:28:18.093
The 21 st century is a digital book.

00:28:19.428 --> 00:28:21.263
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

00:28:24.183 --> 00:28:25.309
Your bank records,

00:28:25.767 --> 00:28:27.144
medical histories, voting patterns,

00:28:27.352 --> 00:28:29.771
emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!

00:28:31.315 --> 00:28:34.651
Zola's algorithm evaluates people's past

00:28:35.569 --> 00:28:36.778
to predict their future.

00:28:37.112 --> 00:28:38.155
And what then?

00:28:41.575 --> 00:28:43.368
Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.

00:28:43.452 --> 00:28:44.995
What then?

00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:50.667
Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.755
A few million at a time.

00:29:08.393 --> 00:29:10.478
I thought you said you knew
how to fly this thing.

00:29:10.645 --> 00:29:12.438
I said, "How hard could it be?"

00:29:15.817 --> 00:29:16.818
They're on the ship!

00:29:17.652 --> 00:29:18.945
Get to the ship!

00:29:22.657 --> 00:29:25.243
Well, whatever you're doing, brother,
I suggest you do it faster.

00:29:25.326 --> 00:29:26.661
Shut up, Loki.

00:29:28.872 --> 00:29:29.956
You must have missed something.

00:29:30.081 --> 00:29:32.792
No, I didn't.
I'm pressing every button on this thing.

00:29:32.876 --> 00:29:34.460
No, don't hit it.
Just press it gently.

00:29:34.586 --> 00:29:36.421
I'm pressing it gently,
it's not working!

00:29:44.178 --> 00:29:45.763
Get him! Get him!

00:30:15.335 --> 00:30:16.836
- I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!

00:30:24.093 --> 00:30:25.345
Look, why don't you
let me take over?

00:30:25.428 --> 00:30:26.679
I'm clearly the better pilot.

00:30:26.971 --> 00:30:28.890
Is that right?
Well, out of the two of us,

00:30:29.015 --> 00:30:30.516
which one can actually fly?

00:30:41.027 --> 00:30:42.612
Oh, dear. Is she dead?

00:30:42.695 --> 00:30:43.696
Jane.

00:30:44.489 --> 00:30:45.490
I'm okay.

00:30:52.622 --> 00:30:53.957
Not a word.

00:30:56.084 --> 00:30:57.460
Now they're following us.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.967
Now they're firing at us.

00:31:04.133 --> 00:31:05.468
Yeah, thank you for
the commentary, Loki,

00:31:05.551 --> 00:31:06.886
it's not at all distracting!

00:31:11.432 --> 00:31:14.060
Well done.
You just decapitated your grandfather.

00:31:25.488 --> 00:31:26.823
You know, this is wonderful.

00:31:26.948 --> 00:31:29.242
This is a tremendous idea.

00:31:29.409 --> 00:31:32.495
Let's steal the biggest,
most obvious ship in the universe

00:31:32.662 --> 00:31:33.913
and escape in that.

00:31:33.997 --> 00:31:35.164
Flying around the city,

00:31:35.248 --> 00:31:37.625
smashing into everything in sight
so everyone can see us.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.460
It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!

00:31:54.058 --> 00:31:55.601
I see your time in the dungeons

00:31:55.685 --> 00:31:58.271
has made you no less graceful, Loki.

00:32:02.483 --> 00:32:04.444
You lied to me.

00:32:05.695 --> 00:32:07.071
I'm impressed.

00:32:07.155 --> 00:32:08.614
I'm glad you're pleased.

00:32:08.698 --> 00:32:09.699
Now, do as you promised.

00:32:09.782 --> 00:32:11.617
And take us to your secret pathway.

00:32:34.849 --> 00:32:36.392
- Fandral.
- Right.

00:32:40.104 --> 00:32:41.105
For Asgard.

00:32:46.736 --> 00:32:47.820
Nothing personal, boys.

00:33:03.127 --> 00:33:04.504
Loki...

00:33:04.587 --> 00:33:07.924
If it were easy,
everyone would do it.

00:33:08.007 --> 00:33:10.009
- Are you mad?
- Possibly.

00:33:25.608 --> 00:33:27.193
Ta-da!

00:33:54.429 --> 00:33:57.000
Harley, tell me what's happening.
Give me a full report.

00:33:57.069 --> 00:34:00.391
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy.
Do you want me to keep eating it?

00:34:00.709 --> 00:34:02.510
- How much have you had?
- Two or three bowls.

00:34:02.589 --> 00:34:05.399
<i>- Can you still see straight?</i>
- Sort of.

00:34:05.469 --> 00:34:06.989
That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.

00:34:07.469 --> 00:34:08.470
<i>Jarvis, how are we?</i>

00:34:08.549 --> 00:34:10.790
<i>It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,</i>

00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:13.952
<i>and then at the end of the sentence
I say the wrong cranberry.</i>

00:34:14.029 --> 00:34:15.315
<i>And, sir, you were right.</i>

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:18.074
<i>Once I factored in
available AIM down/ink facilities</i>

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.551
<i>I was able to pinpoint
the Mandarin's broadcast signal.</i>

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:22.991
What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa,

00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:25.037
Iran, Pakistan, Syria?
Where is it?

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.515
<i>Actually, sir, it's in Miami.</i>

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:29.469
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have
to walk you through

00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:30.954
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,

00:34:31.029 --> 00:34:32.474
but not right now.

00:34:32.549 --> 00:34:33.630
Harley, where is he really?

00:34:33.789 --> 00:34:35.669
<i>Just look on the screen
and tell me where it is.</i>

00:34:37.269 --> 00:34:39.317
Um, it does say Miami, Florida.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:42.359
Okay, first things first, I need
the armour. Where are we at with it?

00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:43.835
Uh, it's not charging.

00:34:51.269 --> 00:34:54.398
<i>Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.</i>

00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:56.910
<i>It may not succeed
in revitalising the Mark 42.</i>

00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:58.952
What's questionable about electricity?
All right?

00:34:59.029 --> 00:35:02.875
- It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna...
- I don't wanna...

00:35:03.629 --> 00:35:04.915
Oh, God, not again.

00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:06.713
<i>Tony?</i>

00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:10.672
<i>Are you having another attack?</i>

00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:12.069
I didn't even mention New York.

00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:15.591
Right, and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it.

00:35:15.989 --> 00:35:17.479
Okay, um, uh...

00:35:19.749 --> 00:35:20.750
God, what am I gonna do?

00:35:21.029 --> 00:35:24.397
Just breathe.
Really, just breathe.

00:35:24.869 --> 00:35:27.315
You're a mechanic, right?

00:35:27.469 --> 00:35:28.834
Right.

00:35:29.629 --> 00:35:30.994
<i>You said so.</i>

00:35:31.949 --> 00:35:33.474
Yes, I did.

00:35:33.789 --> 00:35:36.474
Why don't you just build something?

00:35:48.469 --> 00:35:49.516
Okay.

00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:51.590
<i>Thanks, kid.</i>

00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:40.355
Why is it so hot in here?
I told you to put it at 68.

00:37:40.429 --> 00:37:41.760
My fault again.

00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:44.669
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
I am not your personal air con...

00:38:44.949 --> 00:38:46.149
Well.

00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:49.876
I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.

00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:53.476
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?

00:38:53.549 --> 00:38:54.835
- That's me.
- Ah!

00:38:55.429 --> 00:38:56.476
Nessie.

00:38:56.789 --> 00:39:01.636
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

00:39:01.789 --> 00:39:03.234
There's some guy over here.

00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:06.518
They're made by Americans,
based on a Japanese recipe.

00:39:06.749 --> 00:39:07.796
Hey!

00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:10.950
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

00:39:11.509 --> 00:39:12.556
Don't move.

00:39:12.629 --> 00:39:14.791
I'm not moving.
You want something? Take it.

00:39:14.869 --> 00:39:15.870
Although the guns are all fake

00:39:15.949 --> 00:39:17.792
because those wankers
wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

00:39:17.869 --> 00:39:20.110
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:23.349
Heard enough.

00:39:23.429 --> 00:39:25.557
You're not him.
The Mandarin, the real guy.

00:39:25.709 --> 00:39:26.756
Where?

00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:28.991
Where's the Mandarin?
Where is he?

00:39:29.509 --> 00:39:32.035
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's here. He's here, but he's not here.

00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:33.713
- He's here, but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:35.873
It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.

00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:37.713
- It is.
- It's complicated.

00:39:37.909 --> 00:39:39.149
Uncomplicate it.
Ladies, out.

00:39:39.229 --> 00:39:40.869
Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.

00:39:43.509 --> 00:39:44.715
Sit.

00:39:45.709 --> 00:39:46.949
- Ew!
- Oh, Jesus.

00:39:53.949 --> 00:39:57.032
My name is Trevor.
Trevor Slattery.

00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:58.156
What are you?

00:39:59.549 --> 00:40:00.880
What are you, a decoy?
You're a double, right?

00:40:01.149 --> 00:40:04.039
What, you mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.

00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:06.919
Don't hurt the face!
I'm an actor.

00:40:07.629 --> 00:40:09.791
You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.

00:40:09.869 --> 00:40:13.840
It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," see, it's not real.

00:40:14.189 --> 00:40:16.317
Then how did you get here, Trevor?

00:40:18.269 --> 00:40:24.436
Well, I, um, had a little
problem with, um, substances.

00:40:24.509 --> 00:40:28.753
And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,

00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:31.150
in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.

00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:32.754
- Next?
- Then,

00:40:32.869 --> 00:40:35.759
they approached me
about the role,

00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:37.240
and they knew about the drugs.

00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:38.470
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?

00:40:38.829 --> 00:40:40.274
They said they'd give me more.

00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:41.396
They gave me things.

00:40:41.469 --> 00:40:44.996
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.

00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:47.310
They gave me things.

00:40:48.509 --> 00:40:49.635
Did you just nod off?

00:40:49.789 --> 00:40:50.790
Hey.

00:40:50.869 --> 00:40:52.712
No, and a lovely speedboat.

00:40:52.789 --> 00:40:55.190
And the thing was, he needed someone

00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:59.234
to take credit
for some accidental explosions.

00:41:02.629 --> 00:41:03.630
"He"?

00:41:06.269 --> 00:41:08.237
- Killian?
- Killian.

00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:11.153
- He created you?
- He created me.

00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:12.876
Custom-made terror threat.

00:41:13.389 --> 00:41:15.153
Yes. Yes.

00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:17.113
His think tank thinked it up.

00:41:17.629 --> 00:41:19.836
The pathology of a serial killer.

00:41:20.029 --> 00:41:22.919
The manipulation
of Western iconography.

00:41:23.389 --> 00:41:26.472
Ready for another lesson?

00:41:26.749 --> 00:41:28.035
Blah, blah, blah.

00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:29.595
No.

00:41:29.669 --> 00:41:31.512
Of course,
it was my performance

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:32.636
that brought the Mandarin to life.

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:34.194
Your performance?

00:41:35.269 --> 00:41:36.236
Where people died?

00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:38.033
No, they didn't.

00:41:38.749 --> 00:41:42.037
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.

00:41:42.149 --> 00:41:44.277
Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.

00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:46.158
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.

00:41:46.469 --> 00:41:48.429
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma

00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:49.630
and he might not wake up.

00:41:49.989 --> 00:41:51.070
So you're gonna have
to answer for that.

00:41:51.149 --> 00:41:52.639
You're still going down, pal.

00:41:52.709 --> 00:41:53.710
You under...

00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:03.313
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?

00:42:03.669 --> 00:42:05.910
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?

00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:07.910
No.

00:42:08.189 --> 00:42:09.790
You should have pressed
the panic button.

00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:12.716
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.

00:42:17.941 --> 00:42:19.026
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

00:42:19.193 --> 00:42:20.861
Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?

00:42:21.319 --> 00:42:22.612
Insight's launching in 16 hours.

00:42:22.779 --> 00:42:23.822
We're cutting it a little bit close here.

00:42:24.031 --> 00:42:25.949
I know.
We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans

00:42:26.116 --> 00:42:27.534
and access the helicarriers directly.

00:42:27.743 --> 00:42:28.785
What? Are you crazy?

00:42:29.661 --> 00:42:31.413
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

00:43:15.082 --> 00:43:16.291
Shit!

00:43:27.677 --> 00:43:29.054
Hang on!

00:46:17.681 --> 00:46:18.682
Go! I got this!

00:46:58.722 --> 00:47:00.390
<i>Taking fire above and below expressway.</i>

00:47:00.557 --> 00:47:03.018
<i>Civilians threatened.
Repeat, civilians threatened.</i>

00:47:07.188 --> 00:47:09.899
<i>I make an LZ,
2300 block of Virginia Avenue.</i>

00:47:10.066 --> 00:47:11.151
<i>Rendezvous, two minutes.</i>

00:47:36.593 --> 00:47:37.594
Get out of the way!

00:47:38.336 --> 00:47:39.963
Stay out of the way!

00:49:26.978 --> 00:49:28.521
Bucky?

00:49:28.705 --> 00:49:30.523
Who the hell is Bucky?
