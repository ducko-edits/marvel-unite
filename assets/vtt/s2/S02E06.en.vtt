00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:15.375
<i>Close the bay door!</i>

00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:16.793
<i>Close the bay door now!</i>

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:18.873
<i>They're initiating launch.</i>

00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:26.500
Hey, Cap, how do we know
the good guys from the bad guys?

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:28.168
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:02.536
Hey, Cap,

00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:04.746
I found those bad guys
you were talking about.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.831
You okay?

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.501
I'm not dead yet.

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.218
Let me ask you a question.

00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:23.849
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow

00:01:25.142 --> 00:01:27.269
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters

00:01:27.477 --> 00:01:30.272
into a soccer stadium for execution,

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:36.028
and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.

00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:37.404
Wouldn't you?

00:01:37.612 --> 00:01:39.239
Wouldn't you all?

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:42.617
Not if it was your switch.

00:02:07.142 --> 00:02:08.351
I'm sorry.

00:02:15.025 --> 00:02:16.568
Did I step on your moment?

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:47.814
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.

00:02:48.773 --> 00:02:49.941
Falcon, status?

00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:51.359
Engaging.

00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:16.760
All right, Cap. I'm in.

00:03:19.137 --> 00:03:20.180
Oh, shit.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.170
<i>Eight minutes, Cap.</i>

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.047
Working on it.

00:04:02.388 --> 00:04:03.431
What are you doing?

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:05.099
She's disabling security protocols

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:06.935
and dumping all the secrets
onto the Internet.

00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:08.728
- Including HYDRA's.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

00:04:10.063 --> 00:04:11.147
If you do this,

00:04:11.397 --> 00:04:13.066
none of your past is gonna remain hidden.

00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:18.655
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you

00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:20.406
as you really are?

00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:22.325
Are you?

00:04:25.162 --> 00:04:26.882
<i>Ever hear
of an elephant graveyard?</i>

00:04:26.922 --> 00:04:31.644
Well, two years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.

00:04:33.962 --> 00:04:35.088
This is the <i>Roxxon Norco.</i>

00:04:35.322 --> 00:04:36.323
And, of course, you'll remember

00:04:36.402 --> 00:04:39.087
that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,

00:04:39.322 --> 00:04:42.087
thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.

00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:44.251
What do you want from me?

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:46.488
Uh, nothing, sir.

00:04:46.842 --> 00:04:50.324
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

00:04:50.402 --> 00:04:52.450
You see, I've moved on.

00:04:52.522 --> 00:04:54.889
I found myself
a new political patron,

00:04:55.322 --> 00:04:58.132
and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.

00:04:59.122 --> 00:05:00.965
String him up.

00:05:02.442 --> 00:05:03.603
Hey!

00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.326
Come on.

00:05:24.842 --> 00:05:26.765
You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?

00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:28.571
I hope not.

00:05:53.202 --> 00:05:55.045
Oh, my God.

00:05:55.162 --> 00:05:58.803
He's strung up over the oil
tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.

00:05:58.882 --> 00:06:01.488
Viking funeral.
Public execution.

00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:03.326
Yeah, death by oil.

00:06:09.522 --> 00:06:11.365
<i>Broadcast will commence shortly.</i>

00:06:11.442 --> 00:06:12.568
<i>Take final positions.</i>

00:06:14.002 --> 00:06:15.163
Okay. That's good.

00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:19.088
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:22.860
Malekith is going to fire
the Aether at a spot

00:06:23.027 --> 00:06:24.946
where all the nine worlds
are connecting.

00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:27.532
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:29.033
For each additional world,

00:06:29.158 --> 00:06:31.244
the power will increase exponentially.

00:06:31.536 --> 00:06:34.413
The effect would be universal.

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.165
But the Alignment is only temporary.

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:39.293
He must be in exactly
the right place at the right time.

00:06:39.418 --> 00:06:41.087
Well, how do we know where that is?

00:06:42.296 --> 00:06:44.715
We follow the directions.

00:06:44.882 --> 00:06:46.133
This has happened before

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.595
thousands of years ago,
and the Ancients were there to see it.

00:06:50.263 --> 00:06:51.639
All the great constructions,

00:06:52.473 --> 00:06:55.184
the Mayans, the Chinese, the Egyptians.

00:06:55.268 --> 00:06:58.688
They made use of the gravitational
effects of the Convergence.

00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:00.857
And they left us a map.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.358
Stonehenge,

00:07:03.818 --> 00:07:04.861
Snowdon,

00:07:04.944 --> 00:07:06.112
the Great Orme.

00:07:06.195 --> 00:07:08.072
These are all coordinates taking us...

00:07:09.448 --> 00:07:10.449
Here.

00:07:12.952 --> 00:07:14.412
Greenwich?

00:07:14.495 --> 00:07:17.123
The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.583
Physics is going to go ballistic.

00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:20.501
Increases and decreases in gravity,

00:07:20.626 --> 00:07:22.086
spatial extrusions.

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:24.797
The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.303
I better get my pants.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.434
<i>Focus! This is important.</i>

00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:35.061
<i>We have to hammer
them in all around the site</i>

00:07:35.186 --> 00:07:37.480
and then Jane and Erik will
activate them from the tower.

00:07:37.814 --> 00:07:39.273
They're taped together.

00:07:39.482 --> 00:07:41.776
Do you even know
what these things do?

00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:43.778
No.

00:07:44.112 --> 00:07:45.113
Neither do I.

00:07:53.913 --> 00:07:55.915
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.

00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:09.720
Holy...

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:10.847
Shit.

00:09:29.383 --> 00:09:31.677
You needn't have come
so far, Asgardian.

00:09:31.802 --> 00:09:34.013
Death would've come
to you soon enough.

00:09:34.138 --> 00:09:35.640
Not by your hand.

00:09:35.723 --> 00:09:38.476
Your universe was never meant to be.

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:41.646
Your world and your family

00:09:41.729 --> 00:09:43.856
will be extinguished!

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:03.044
Alpha lock.

00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:06.214
Falcon, where are you now?

00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:07.299
I had to take a detour.

00:10:39.915 --> 00:10:41.500
Oh, yeah!

00:10:47.506 --> 00:10:48.548
I'm in.

00:10:52.177 --> 00:10:54.012
Bravo lock.

00:10:55.806 --> 00:10:57.098
Two down, one to go.

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:00.894
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.397
We're the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.

00:11:46.857 --> 00:11:49.526
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.

00:11:49.734 --> 00:11:51.403
It takes two Alpha Level members.

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:53.572
Don't worry. Company's coming.

00:12:17.178 --> 00:12:18.305
Did you get my flowers?

00:12:21.016 --> 00:12:22.684
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:26.521
Because I thought you had me killed.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.189
You know how the game works.

00:12:29.274 --> 00:12:30.984
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

00:12:31.067 --> 00:12:32.360
Because you were the best,

00:12:32.527 --> 00:12:33.987
and the most ruthless person I ever met.

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:36.531
I did what I did to protect people.

00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:39.409
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:42.662
Disorder. War.

00:12:43.663 --> 00:12:45.999
It's just a matter of time before
a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.335
or an EMP fries Chicago.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.338
Diplomacy?

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.840
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

00:12:54.758 --> 00:12:57.677
And you know where I learned that.
Bogota.

00:12:59.429 --> 00:13:02.140
You didn't ask.
You just did what had to be done.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.646
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:09.981
by sacrificing 20 million.

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:13.485
It's the next step, Nick.

00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:14.819
If you have the courage to take it.

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:17.113
No. I have the courage not to.

00:13:21.618 --> 00:13:23.536
<i>Retinal scanner active.</i>

00:13:24.996 --> 00:13:27.374
You don't think we've wiped
your clearance from the system?

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.501
I know you erased my password.

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:31.628
Probably deleted my retinal scan.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.006
But if you want to stay ahead
of me, Mr. Secretary,

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.972
you need to keep both eyes open.

00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:47.894
<i>Alpha level confirmed.</i>

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:50.230
<i>Encryption code accepted.</i>

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:51.564
<i>Safeguards removed.</i>

00:13:52.732 --> 00:13:53.972
Is your gun up?

00:13:54.052 --> 00:13:55.656
Yep. What do I do?

00:13:55.732 --> 00:13:58.178
Stay on my six, cover high
and don't shoot me in the back.

00:13:58.372 --> 00:14:00.534
Six, high, back. All right.

00:14:09.452 --> 00:14:10.738
You see that? Nailed it.

00:14:11.372 --> 00:14:12.733
Yeah, you really killed the glass.

00:14:12.772 --> 00:14:13.853
You think I was aiming for the bulb?

00:14:13.972 --> 00:14:15.492
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.

00:14:16.652 --> 00:14:18.142
<i>All personnel, we have hostiles</i>

00:14:18.212 --> 00:14:19.213
<i>- on east unit 12.</i>
- Over there!

00:14:19.452 --> 00:14:21.056
<i>- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.</i>
- I'm out. Give me...

00:14:21.132 --> 00:14:23.419
- You got extra magazines?
- They're not universal, Tony.

00:14:23.572 --> 00:14:25.620
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.

00:14:25.732 --> 00:14:27.018
- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.

00:14:27.092 --> 00:14:28.173
You've got, like, five of them.

00:14:28.252 --> 00:14:29.458
Here's what I'm going to do.

00:14:29.652 --> 00:14:31.495
Save my spot, ready?

00:14:31.612 --> 00:14:34.377
- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.

00:14:34.492 --> 00:14:35.778
Here we go.

00:14:39.732 --> 00:14:41.575
Three guys, one girl, all armed.

00:14:51.652 --> 00:14:53.222
God, I would kill
for some armour right now.

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:55.260
- You're right. We need backup.
- Yeah, a bunch.

00:14:56.892 --> 00:14:58.053
You know what?

00:15:02.012 --> 00:15:03.093
Is that...

00:15:03.252 --> 00:15:05.061
Yep.

00:15:05.132 --> 00:15:06.736
- Are those...
- Yeah.

00:15:23.452 --> 00:15:24.692
Merry Christmas, buddy.

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:32.697
Jarvis, target
EXTREMIS heat signatures.

00:15:32.772 --> 00:15:34.615
Disable with extreme prejudice.

00:15:35.132 --> 00:15:36.493
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:15:40.132 --> 00:15:43.022
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

00:15:44.492 --> 00:15:45.539
Take them to church.

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:54.302
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

00:16:01.572 --> 00:16:02.573
Incoming!

00:16:07.172 --> 00:16:08.822
Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.

00:16:21.812 --> 00:16:23.892
This is how you've been managing
your down time, huh?

00:16:23.932 --> 00:16:25.013
Everybody needs a hobby.

00:16:31.492 --> 00:16:33.252
Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out,
will you?

00:17:01.452 --> 00:17:03.056
Nice timing.

00:17:03.132 --> 00:17:05.339
Oh, yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:08.456
Oh, I'm sorry,
they're only coded to me.

00:17:08.892 --> 00:17:10.815
What does that mean?
I got you covered.

00:17:14.092 --> 00:17:16.459
<i>Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you a lift?</i>

00:17:16.532 --> 00:17:18.022
Very funny.

00:17:28.195 --> 00:17:31.198
Charlie carrier is 45 degrees
off the port bow.

00:17:36.912 --> 00:17:37.996
Six minutes.

00:17:38.163 --> 00:17:40.624
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.168
Roger. Let me know when you're ready.

00:17:45.796 --> 00:17:47.005
I just did!

00:18:04.773 --> 00:18:06.692
You know, you're a lot
heavier than you look.

00:18:06.858 --> 00:18:07.985
I had a big breakfast.

00:18:10.612 --> 00:18:11.905
Steve!

00:18:42.394 --> 00:18:43.770
<i>Cap! Cap, come in.
Are you okay?</i>

00:18:44.354 --> 00:18:45.647
Yeah, I'm here.

00:18:46.189 --> 00:18:47.232
I'm still on the helicarrier.

00:18:48.275 --> 00:18:49.901
- Where are you?
- <i>I'm grounded.</i>

00:18:50.527 --> 00:18:52.863
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

00:18:53.697 --> 00:18:55.574
Don't worry. I got it.

00:18:58.173 --> 00:18:59.591
We're running out of time.

00:18:59.716 --> 00:19:02.052
- Almost there.
- Are you sure this is going to work?

00:19:02.385 --> 00:19:04.971
These devices were made
to detect anomalies, not cause them.

00:19:06.014 --> 00:19:07.098
Come on.

00:19:12.353 --> 00:19:14.480
Come on, Darcy.

00:19:24.294 --> 00:19:26.255
You know, with all that power,

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.131
I thought you'd hit harder.

00:19:53.532 --> 00:19:54.616
Done.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.251
The Convergence will be
in full effect in seven minutes.

00:20:04.376 --> 00:20:06.545
That just means we have
to keep Malekith busy for eight.

00:20:13.051 --> 00:20:14.928
Okay, you might want
to hold on to something.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.977
That is awesome!

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.562
<i>How did you do that?</i>

00:20:23.645 --> 00:20:24.938
Well, the gravitational fields

00:20:25.022 --> 00:20:27.316
interact with the weak spots
between worlds, creating...

00:20:27.399 --> 00:20:28.817
Get the guy with the sword!

00:20:32.237 --> 00:20:34.114
- Oops.
- Let's go.

00:20:36.074 --> 00:20:37.784
What the hell just happened?

00:20:38.577 --> 00:20:39.578
Move!

00:20:57.346 --> 00:20:58.638
What are you all doing?

00:20:58.764 --> 00:21:00.432
You need to get out of here, now!

00:21:00.557 --> 00:21:02.100
You're joking, right?

00:21:02.225 --> 00:21:03.185
That's Thor out there.

00:21:03.268 --> 00:21:05.395
He's waving his hammer
around and everything!

00:22:32.824 --> 00:22:33.867
People are gonna die, Buck.

00:22:35.994 --> 00:22:37.453
I can't let that happen.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.255
Please don't make me do this.

00:23:57.325 --> 00:23:58.326
Done.

00:23:59.494 --> 00:24:00.495
And it's trending.

00:24:08.169 --> 00:24:10.004
Unless you want a two-inch
hole in your sternum,

00:24:10.088 --> 00:24:11.172
I'd put that gun down.

00:24:13.925 --> 00:24:15.843
That was armed the moment
you pinned it on.

00:24:15.926 --> 00:24:17.427
<i>Emergency evacuation alert.</i>

00:24:17.636 --> 00:24:20.597
<i>All personnel,
proceed to designated safety zones.</i>

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.709
All S.H.I.E.L.D. agents regroup
at Rally Point Delta.

00:24:32.381 --> 00:24:34.508
<i>Sir, the Council's been breached.</i>

00:24:34.842 --> 00:24:37.219
- Repeat, Dispatch.
- <i>Black Widow's up there.</i>

00:24:37.428 --> 00:24:38.762
Headed up.

00:24:41.088 --> 00:24:42.339
- Falcon?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

00:24:42.464 --> 00:24:43.424
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

00:24:43.507 --> 00:24:44.508
I'm on it.

00:25:10.992 --> 00:25:12.076
Drop it!

00:25:12.702 --> 00:25:13.703
Drop it!

00:25:33.933 --> 00:25:35.264
<i>Sir, I've located Ms Potts.</i>

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:36.334
About time.

00:25:48.893 --> 00:25:53.820
Stop!
Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:58.494
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

00:25:59.653 --> 00:26:00.893
You're such a jerk.

00:26:01.053 --> 00:26:02.533
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.

00:26:04.893 --> 00:26:06.133
Come on. A little more, baby.

00:26:13.653 --> 00:26:15.337
Oh!

00:26:22.653 --> 00:26:23.700
Is this guy bothering you?

00:26:25.493 --> 00:26:26.904
Don't get up.

00:26:30.053 --> 00:26:31.054
Ooh.

00:26:31.493 --> 00:26:32.654
Is it hot in there?

00:26:34.933 --> 00:26:36.294
Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?

00:26:37.373 --> 00:26:40.695
Like a little turtle,
cooking in his little turtle suit.

00:26:41.013 --> 00:26:42.014
Oh, Tony.

00:26:42.093 --> 00:26:44.095
She's watching.

00:26:45.773 --> 00:26:47.173
I think you should close your eyes.

00:26:47.533 --> 00:26:49.023
Close your eyes.

00:26:49.693 --> 00:26:51.855
Close your eyes.
You don't want to see this.

00:26:59.213 --> 00:27:01.022
Yeah, you take a minute.

00:27:33.413 --> 00:27:35.654
Jarvis, give me a suit right now!

00:27:46.653 --> 00:27:47.654
Oh, come on!

00:27:49.573 --> 00:27:52.816
Mr President!
Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.

00:27:53.733 --> 00:27:56.100
Just hold on. Hold on.

00:28:08.973 --> 00:28:10.338
Okay.

00:28:17.813 --> 00:28:19.144
Bye-bye.

00:28:30.853 --> 00:28:32.014
Brace yourself.

00:28:42.973 --> 00:28:44.862
You look damn good, Mr President,

00:28:45.013 --> 00:28:46.503
but I'm gonna need that suit back.

00:29:00.093 --> 00:29:01.253
<i>The President is secure, Tony</i>

00:29:01.293 --> 00:29:02.733
<i>- I'm clearing the area.</i>
- Nice work.

00:29:03.733 --> 00:29:05.417
- Ready, sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?

00:29:14.173 --> 00:29:16.938
Pep, I got you.
Relax, I got you.

00:29:17.013 --> 00:29:18.134
Just look at me!

00:29:20.493 --> 00:29:22.774
Honey, I can't reach any
further and you can't stay there.

00:29:22.853 --> 00:29:24.298
All right?
You've got to let go.

00:29:24.773 --> 00:29:27.856
You've got to let go!
I'll catch you, I promise.

00:29:29.613 --> 00:29:31.263
No!

00:29:46.899 --> 00:29:48.401
<i>Confirming ship is hostile.</i>

00:29:48.568 --> 00:29:50.444
<i>Confirmed, ship is hostile.</i>

00:29:50.528 --> 00:29:51.946
<i>You have permission to engage.</i>

00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:53.239
<i>Roger.</i>

00:29:53.322 --> 00:29:54.448
<i>Missiles locked.</i>

00:29:55.283 --> 00:29:57.034
<i>Missiles away.</i>

00:29:58.494 --> 00:29:59.662
<i>Missiles off target.</i>

00:29:59.745 --> 00:30:02.456
<i>I repeat, target missed.
I'm losing control.</i>

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:05.334
<i>Mayday! Mayday!
Lost positive control.</i>

00:30:07.461 --> 00:30:08.462
What are you doing?

00:30:08.546 --> 00:30:10.047
My signal's not connecting.

00:30:12.341 --> 00:30:13.342
Jane!

00:30:13.426 --> 00:30:14.510
Come on.

00:30:56.802 --> 00:30:58.095
Are you all right?

00:30:58.262 --> 00:30:59.263
You saved my life.

00:31:02.892 --> 00:31:03.893
Yeah.

00:31:03.976 --> 00:31:05.269
I guess I did.

00:31:14.528 --> 00:31:16.739
- Darcy?
- Jane!

00:31:16.864 --> 00:31:19.200
- Ian!
- Selvig!

00:31:19.742 --> 00:31:20.910
Mew mew!

00:31:24.538 --> 00:31:26.415
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

00:31:28.668 --> 00:31:29.669
How do I get to Greenwich?

00:31:30.753 --> 00:31:32.755
Take this train. Three stops.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.343
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

00:31:39.261 --> 00:31:41.222
Sorry. Sorry.

00:32:18.718 --> 00:32:20.386
- We're out of time.
- Jane.

00:32:21.512 --> 00:32:22.638
Jane!

00:32:41.853 --> 00:32:45.107
I'm on 41, headed toward
the southwest stairwell.

00:32:51.822 --> 00:32:53.407
This is gonna hurt.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.786
There are no prisoners with HYDRA.
Just order.

00:32:57.995 --> 00:33:00.205
And order only comes through pain.

00:33:01.623 --> 00:33:04.001
- You ready for yours?
- Man, shut the hell up.

00:33:05.794 --> 00:33:07.129
Lieutenant, how much longer?

00:33:07.212 --> 00:33:09.298
<i>65 seconds to satellite link.</i>

00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:12.384
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.

00:33:16.388 --> 00:33:17.472
One minute.

00:33:37.367 --> 00:33:38.910
<i>30 seconds, Cap.</i>

00:33:40.537 --> 00:33:41.705
Stand by.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.376
Charlie...

00:33:55.677 --> 00:33:56.928
<i>We've reached 3,000 feet.</i>

00:33:57.971 --> 00:33:58.972
Sat link coming online now.

00:34:01.516 --> 00:34:02.601
Deploy algorithm.

00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:05.395
Algorithm deployed.

00:34:06.646 --> 00:34:08.106
<i>We are go to target.</i>

00:34:22.136 --> 00:34:23.512
<i>Target saturation reached.</i>

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:24.930
All targets assigned.

00:34:25.014 --> 00:34:26.015
Fire when ready.

00:34:28.398 --> 00:34:29.608
Firing in...

00:34:29.775 --> 00:34:30.817
<i>Three,</i>

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.623
two...

00:34:33.791 --> 00:34:35.126
One.

00:34:37.795 --> 00:34:38.838
Charlie lock.

00:34:39.296 --> 00:34:40.297
Where are the targets?

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.541
Where are the targets?

00:34:43.167 --> 00:34:44.376
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:02.811
Fire now.

00:35:03.896 --> 00:35:05.147
- But, Steve...
- Do it!

00:35:05.668 --> 00:35:06.835
<i>Do it now!</i>

00:35:37.366 --> 00:35:38.367
What a waste.

00:35:38.534 --> 00:35:41.745
So, you still on the fence
about Rogers' chances?

00:35:41.954 --> 00:35:44.999
Time to go, Councilwoman.
This way. Come on.

00:35:45.499 --> 00:35:47.001
You're going to fly me out of here.

00:35:47.209 --> 00:35:50.379
You know, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.

00:35:50.587 --> 00:35:51.880
You already did.

00:35:52.047 --> 00:35:54.008
You will again, when it's useful.

00:36:07.354 --> 00:36:08.480
Romanoff.

00:36:09.231 --> 00:36:10.316
Natasha.

00:36:12.359 --> 00:36:14.153
Natasha! Come on!

00:36:21.201 --> 00:36:22.745
Those really do sting.

00:36:55.778 --> 00:36:57.196
Hail HYDRA.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.759
A shame. I would've caught her.

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:14.911
Eject.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:01.920
Well, here we are on the roof.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:13.711
<i>Mark 42, inbound.</i>

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:17.238
I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.

00:39:33.563 --> 00:39:34.564
Whatever.

00:39:35.763 --> 00:39:37.288
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.

00:39:38.923 --> 00:39:42.644
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.

00:39:45.443 --> 00:39:47.810
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!

00:39:47.963 --> 00:39:50.250
You're right. I don't deserve her.

00:39:51.643 --> 00:39:53.566
Here's where you're wrong.

00:39:53.643 --> 00:39:54.849
She was already perfect.

00:40:02.643 --> 00:40:04.247
Jarvis,

00:40:05.323 --> 00:40:06.813
do me a favour and blow Mark 42.

00:40:07.243 --> 00:40:08.324
No...

00:40:36.507 --> 00:40:37.925
Thor!

00:40:38.926 --> 00:40:39.968
We're too late.

00:40:41.345 --> 00:40:43.430
The Convergence is at its peak.

00:40:44.306 --> 00:40:45.432
Can those things stop him?

00:40:45.557 --> 00:40:46.642
Not from here.

00:40:46.809 --> 00:40:49.603
We can't get close enough.

00:40:50.646 --> 00:40:51.897
I can.

00:41:17.214 --> 00:41:18.215
Malekith!

00:41:25.597 --> 00:41:28.851
Darkness returns, Asgardian.

00:41:28.976 --> 00:41:32.271
Have you come to witness
the end of your universe?

00:41:32.354 --> 00:41:34.398
I've come to accept
your surrender.

00:41:53.959 --> 00:41:56.044
You think you can stop this?

00:41:56.754 --> 00:41:59.548
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

00:41:59.673 --> 00:42:01.341
But you can.

00:42:46.887 --> 00:42:48.889
Thor! No.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.622
Jane!

00:43:30.885 --> 00:43:32.470
Everybody okay?

00:44:20.838 --> 00:44:22.298
You're out of your depth, kid.

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:27.511
Son of a bitch!

00:44:39.648 --> 00:44:41.233
Please tell me you got
that chopper in the air!

00:44:42.026 --> 00:44:43.152
<i>Sam, where are you?</i>

00:44:44.028 --> 00:44:45.863
41st floor! Northwest corner!

00:44:46.071 --> 00:44:47.615
We're on it! Stay where you are!

00:44:47.823 --> 00:44:48.907
Not an option!

00:45:03.714 --> 00:45:05.883
41st floor! 41st!

00:45:06.216 --> 00:45:09.553
It's not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building.

00:45:10.929 --> 00:45:13.432
Hill! Where's Steve?
You got a location on Rogers?

00:45:29.907 --> 00:45:30.991
You know me.

00:45:33.013 --> 00:45:34.348
No, I don't!

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:45.242
Bucky.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.060
You've known me your whole life.

00:45:55.387 --> 00:45:59.308
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

00:45:59.516 --> 00:46:00.726
Shut up!

00:46:09.443 --> 00:46:10.903
I'm not gonna fight you.

00:46:15.223 --> 00:46:16.557
You're my friend.

00:46:23.248 --> 00:46:24.625
You're my mission.

00:46:26.919 --> 00:46:29.699
You're my mission!

00:46:32.257 --> 00:46:33.258
Then finish it.

00:46:36.762 --> 00:46:38.931
Because I'm with you
to the end of the line.

00:48:58.263 --> 00:49:00.391
No more false faces.

00:49:01.223 --> 00:49:03.032
You said you wanted the Mandarin.

00:49:04.223 --> 00:49:06.908
You're looking right at him.

00:49:07.263 --> 00:49:10.267
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.

00:49:10.743 --> 00:49:12.427
I am the Mandarin!

00:49:23.863 --> 00:49:25.103
I got nothing.

00:49:31.943 --> 00:49:34.708
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

00:49:42.943 --> 00:49:44.866
What?
Oh, what, are you mad at me?

00:49:56.143 --> 00:49:57.144
Whoo!

00:50:10.816 --> 00:50:12.022
Honey?

00:50:16.423 --> 00:50:18.107
Oh, my God.

00:50:19.663 --> 00:50:21.870
That was really violent.

00:50:22.863 --> 00:50:24.865
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...

00:50:25.023 --> 00:50:27.071
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?

00:50:30.543 --> 00:50:32.227
Who's the hot mess now?

00:50:32.383 --> 00:50:34.465
It's still debatable.

00:50:35.023 --> 00:50:36.309
Probably tipping your way a little bit.

00:50:36.383 --> 00:50:38.431
Why don't you dress
like this at home? Hmm?

00:50:38.503 --> 00:50:40.426
Sport bra. The whole deal.

00:50:40.503 --> 00:50:43.712
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.

00:50:43.903 --> 00:50:46.429
What am I going to complain
about now?

00:50:47.263 --> 00:50:48.913
Well, it's me.

00:50:49.703 --> 00:50:50.750
You'll think of something.

00:50:52.303 --> 00:50:53.714
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.

00:50:53.783 --> 00:50:55.706
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.

00:50:56.743 --> 00:50:57.744
Not hot.

00:50:59.143 --> 00:51:00.827
Am I gonna be okay?

00:51:00.903 --> 00:51:01.904
No.

00:51:01.983 --> 00:51:04.714
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.

00:51:04.983 --> 00:51:06.826
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:08.792
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.

00:51:08.863 --> 00:51:11.992
I think I can get you better.

00:51:12.623 --> 00:51:15.149
That's what I do. I fix stuff.

00:51:15.223 --> 00:51:17.510
And all your distractions?

00:51:18.063 --> 00:51:20.145
Uh... I'm going to shave
them down a little bit.

00:51:20.383 --> 00:51:22.750
Jarvis. Hey.

00:51:22.823 --> 00:51:26.145
<i>All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?</i>

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:28.351
You know what to do.

00:51:28.423 --> 00:51:31.188
<i>The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?</i>

00:51:31.263 --> 00:51:34.426
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

00:52:10.743 --> 00:52:12.029
Okay, so far?
Do you like it?

00:52:14.583 --> 00:52:15.630
It'll do.

00:52:40.617 --> 00:52:42.535
He's gonna come back.

00:52:45.038 --> 00:52:46.915
Except, you know,

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.209
last time he was gone for,
like, two years.

00:52:49.292 --> 00:52:51.211
Well, it's only been two days, so...

00:52:53.129 --> 00:52:54.964
Did he say anything before he left?

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:57.258
Yeah, he had to figure
some stuff out with his father.

00:52:57.342 --> 00:53:01.471
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.

00:53:09.979 --> 00:53:14.651
<i>You once said there would
never be a wiser king than me.</i>

00:53:14.818 --> 00:53:15.819
<i>You were wrong.</i>

00:53:16.403 --> 00:53:20.281
The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.

00:53:20.365 --> 00:53:23.493
Every one of them saw you
offer your life to save them.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:28.581
What can Asgard offer
its new king in return?

00:53:29.749 --> 00:53:31.626
My life.

00:53:32.752 --> 00:53:35.463
Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.

00:53:35.547 --> 00:53:40.343
I will protect Asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath,

00:53:40.468 --> 00:53:42.720
but I cannot do so from that chair.

00:53:42.846 --> 00:53:46.975
Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.

00:53:47.976 --> 00:53:50.645
The brutality, the sacrifice...

00:53:50.812 --> 00:53:52.272
It changes you.

00:53:52.355 --> 00:53:55.775
I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.

00:53:56.359 --> 00:54:01.156
Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?

00:54:01.239 --> 00:54:03.783
When you speak,
do I never hear Mother's voice?

00:54:05.785 --> 00:54:08.329
This is not for Jane, Father.

00:54:08.413 --> 00:54:10.832
She does not know
what I came here to say.

00:54:10.915 --> 00:54:14.252
Now, forbid me to see her,
or say she can rule at my side.

00:54:14.377 --> 00:54:15.712
It changes nothing.

00:54:16.296 --> 00:54:19.632
One son who wanted
the throne too much,

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.677
another who will not take it.

00:54:23.219 --> 00:54:24.971
Is this my legacy?

00:54:25.138 --> 00:54:26.723
Loki died with honor.

00:54:27.682 --> 00:54:29.058
I shall try to live the same.

00:54:29.142 --> 00:54:30.560
Is that not legacy enough?

00:54:41.571 --> 00:54:43.907
It belongs to you.

00:54:44.657 --> 00:54:46.409
If you are worthy of it.

00:54:46.493 --> 00:54:48.995
I shall try to be.

00:54:50.413 --> 00:54:55.126
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.

00:54:56.085 --> 00:54:57.754
I know.

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:03.927
If I were proud of the man
my son had become,

00:55:04.427 --> 00:55:06.763
even that, I could not say.

00:55:09.265 --> 00:55:12.894
It would speak only from my heart.

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:15.688
Go,

00:55:16.773 --> 00:55:18.274
my son.

00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:21.653
Thank you, Father.

00:55:37.005 --> 00:55:38.047
No.

00:55:39.629 --> 00:55:41.297
Thank you.

00:55:49.812 --> 00:55:51.143
<i>A famous man once said,</i>

00:55:51.332 --> 00:55:53.983
<i>"We create our own demons."</i>

00:55:55.532 --> 00:55:57.534
<i>Who said that?
What does that even mean?</i>

00:55:57.692 --> 00:55:59.501
<i>Doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.</i>

00:55:59.652 --> 00:56:01.222
<i>So, now, he was famous</i>

00:56:01.372 --> 00:56:03.773
<i>and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.</i>

00:56:04.132 --> 00:56:05.497
<i>I don't, uh...</i>

00:56:05.692 --> 00:56:07.694
<i>I'm going to start again.</i>

00:56:12.659 --> 00:56:14.661
<i>You start with something pure,</i>

00:56:15.659 --> 00:56:19.903
<i>something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.</i>

00:56:21.059 --> 00:56:22.709
<i>The compromises.</i>

00:56:29.259 --> 00:56:31.990
<i>We create our own demons.</i>

00:56:32.659 --> 00:56:34.741
Oh!

00:56:37.219 --> 00:56:39.381
Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!

00:56:40.939 --> 00:56:44.660
<i>As promised, I got Pepper
sorted out. It took some tinkering.</i>

00:56:44.739 --> 00:56:48.539
<i>But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"</i>

00:56:52.379 --> 00:56:55.701
<i>Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous,</i>

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:59.306
<i>but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.</i>

00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:02.748
<i>And now, neither will I.</i>

00:57:03.539 --> 00:57:05.428
<i>Let me tell you...</i>

00:57:05.499 --> 00:57:07.661
<i>...that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.</i>

00:57:28.579 --> 00:57:30.547
It's okay. It's okay.

00:57:30.619 --> 00:57:31.666
It's okay.

00:57:31.739 --> 00:57:32.740
No, look.

00:58:50.019 --> 00:58:54.069
<i>So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...</i>

00:58:54.139 --> 00:58:58.463
<i>I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,</i>

00:58:58.539 --> 00:59:00.621
<i>or a hobby.</i>

00:59:00.699 --> 00:59:02.701
<i>It was a cocoon.</i>

00:59:03.899 --> 00:59:05.708
<i>And now,</i>

00:59:06.659 --> 00:59:08.946
<i>I'm a changed man.</i>

00:59:17.899 --> 00:59:21.540
<i>You can take away my house,
all my tricks and toys.</i>

00:59:22.539 --> 00:59:25.383
<i>One thing you can't take away...</i>

00:59:28.072 --> 00:59:29.881
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.755
On your left.

01:01:03.014 --> 01:01:05.391
<i>Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,</i>

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.684
<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

01:01:06.893 --> 01:01:08.311
<i>I do.</i>

01:01:10.313 --> 01:01:12.023
<i>Why haven't we yet heard
from Captain Rogers?</i>

01:01:14.734 --> 01:01:16.653
I don't know what there is
left for him to say.

01:01:16.861 --> 01:01:18.696
I think the wreck
in the middle of the Potomac

01:01:18.905 --> 01:01:20.073
made his point fairly eloquently.

01:01:20.281 --> 01:01:21.240
Well, he could explain how

01:01:21.449 --> 01:01:24.035
this country is expected
to maintain its national security

01:01:24.202 --> 01:01:28.331
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

01:01:28.748 --> 01:01:30.708
HYDRA was selling you lies,
not intelligence.

01:01:30.875 --> 01:01:33.753
Many of which you seemed to have
had a personal hand in telling.

01:01:33.962 --> 01:01:35.213
Agent, you should know

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.048
that there are some on this committee

01:01:37.256 --> 01:01:39.384
who feel, given your service record,

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.302
both for this country and against it,

01:01:42.053 --> 01:01:43.805
that you belong in a penitentiary.

01:01:44.013 --> 01:01:45.974
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

01:01:47.892 --> 01:01:49.477
You're not going to put me in a prison.

01:01:50.478 --> 01:01:54.399
You're not going to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?

01:01:55.858 --> 01:01:57.235
Do enlighten us.

01:01:57.527 --> 01:01:58.861
Because you need us.

01:01:59.988 --> 01:02:02.240
<i>Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,</i>

01:02:02.448 --> 01:02:04.617
<i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i>

01:02:05.159 --> 01:02:07.912
<i>But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.</i>

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.541
So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:14.252
You'll know where to find me.

01:02:49.746 --> 01:02:52.582
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

01:02:53.082 --> 01:02:54.625
You get used to it.

01:02:57.336 --> 01:02:59.505
We've been data mining HYDRA's files.

01:02:59.714 --> 01:03:01.841
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

01:03:03.426 --> 01:03:04.761
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.971
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:09.766
There's something I got to do first.

01:03:10.683 --> 01:03:13.227
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:15.980
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

01:03:17.106 --> 01:03:18.858
All right, then.

01:03:23.488 --> 01:03:27.700
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.

01:03:29.494 --> 01:03:31.079
You should be honored.
That's about as close as he gets

01:03:31.287 --> 01:03:32.914
to saying thank you.

01:03:34.082 --> 01:03:35.166
Not going with him?

01:03:35.666 --> 01:03:36.918
No.

01:03:37.126 --> 01:03:39.128
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

01:03:39.962 --> 01:03:42.006
I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.341
That might take a while.

01:03:43.841 --> 01:03:45.468
I'm counting on it.

01:03:47.678 --> 01:03:48.805
That thing you asked for,

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:51.474
I called in a few favors from Kiev.

01:03:54.435 --> 01:03:57.188
Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.

01:03:57.605 --> 01:03:58.815
She's not a nurse.

01:03:59.023 --> 01:04:00.858
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

01:04:01.776 --> 01:04:03.861
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

01:04:04.612 --> 01:04:05.613
She's nice.

01:04:18.084 --> 01:04:19.836
Be careful, Steve.

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:22.421
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

01:04:33.975 --> 01:04:35.726
You're going after him.

01:04:36.144 --> 01:04:37.395
You don't have to come with me.

01:04:37.562 --> 01:04:38.646
I know.

01:04:40.606 --> 01:04:41.774
When do we start?
