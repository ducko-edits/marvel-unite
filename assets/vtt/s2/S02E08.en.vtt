WEBVTT

00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:15.523
Thor didn't say where he
was going for answers?

00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:18.849
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:21.938
I was kind of hoping Thor
would be the exception.

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:24.066
Yeah, give him time.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.109
We don't know what
the Maximoff kid showed him.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.946
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:31.698
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.791
Seems like you walked away all right.

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:36.953
Is that a problem?

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.247
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:41.500
Call me old-fashioned.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:44.169
Well, let's just say you
haven't seen it yet.

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:46.671
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:49.174
Well, I guess you'd know.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.550
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:51.843
Banner and I were doing research.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.096
- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

00:00:54.738 --> 00:00:55.823
Isn't that the mission?

00:00:55.998 --> 00:00:57.249
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:59.642
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:05.391
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

00:01:05.516 --> 00:01:07.059
innocent people die.

00:01:07.184 --> 00:01:08.185
Every time.

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:13.065
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.025
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.653
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

00:01:17.987 --> 00:01:20.155
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:25.327
Don't take from my pile.

00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:36.755
Hello, Deere.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.010
Tell me everything.

00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:43.637
What ails you?

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:44.847
Do me a favor.

00:01:46.822 --> 00:01:48.699
Try not to bring it to life.

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:50.518
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.564
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:54.982
Was she ever not working for you?

00:01:55.107 --> 00:01:56.567
Artificial intelligence.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.278
You never even hesitated.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.863
Look, it's been a really long day,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.615
like Eugene O'Neill long,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.700
so how's about we skip to the part
where you're useful.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.160
Look me in the eye and tell me

00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:07.536
you're going to shut him down.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.246
You're not the director of me.

00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:11.206
I'm not the director of anybody.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.125
I'm just an old man

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.377
who cares very much about you.

00:02:18.255 --> 00:02:20.049
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

00:02:21.884 --> 00:02:23.010
I saw it.

00:02:23.218 --> 00:02:24.762
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:27.890
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:29.767
The whole world, too.

00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:31.226
Because of me.

00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:33.896
I wasn't ready.

00:02:35.397 --> 00:02:36.774
I didn't do all I could.

00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:39.902
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:44.031
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:46.408
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

00:02:46.742 --> 00:02:48.911
The end of the path I started us on.

00:02:49.787 --> 00:02:51.872
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:55.584
War isn't one of them.

00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:00.631
I watched my friends die.

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.883
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

00:03:04.343 --> 00:03:05.761
Nope.

00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:09.306
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.600
is that you didn't.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.953
I didn't realize you were waiting.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:08.949
The world just saw the Hulk.

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.527
The real Hulk, for the first time.

00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:18.605
- You know I have to leave.
- You assume that I have to stay?

00:04:20.778 --> 00:04:23.447
I had this, um, dream.

00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:25.741
The kind that seems normal at the time,

00:04:26.992 --> 00:04:28.243
but when you wake...

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.745
What did you dream?

00:04:30.788 --> 00:04:32.581
That I was an Avenger.

00:04:34.426 --> 00:04:35.719
That I was anything more

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:38.420
than the assassin they made me.

00:04:39.922 --> 00:04:42.007
I think you're being hard on yourself.

00:04:44.093 --> 00:04:46.595
Here I was hoping that was your job.

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:51.100
What are you doing?

00:04:52.768 --> 00:04:54.561
I'm running with it.

00:04:55.854 --> 00:04:57.481
With you.

00:04:58.232 --> 00:05:00.567
If running is the plan,

00:05:01.652 --> 00:05:03.445
as far as you want.

00:05:05.322 --> 00:05:07.074
Are you out of your mind?

00:05:12.413 --> 00:05:13.831
I want you to understand that, um...

00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:15.332
Natasha,

00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:17.918
where can I go?

00:05:19.002 --> 00:05:21.296
Where in the world am I not a threat?

00:05:21.422 --> 00:05:23.757
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?

00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:26.468
Even if I didn't just...

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:29.471
There's no future with me.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.141
I can't ever...

00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:34.643
I can't have this.

00:05:35.352 --> 00:05:36.478
Kids.

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:39.523
Do the math. I physically can't.

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:42.693
Neither can I.

00:05:47.406 --> 00:05:50.909
In the Red Room where I was trained...

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.871
Where I was raised, um,

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.458
they have a graduation ceremony.

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.919
They sterilize you.

00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:05.549
It's efficient.

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:09.845
One less thing to worry about.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.309
The one thing that might
matter more than a mission.

00:06:17.686 --> 00:06:19.563
Makes everything easier.

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:22.191
Even killing.

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:30.365
You still think you're the only
monster on the team?

00:06:36.538 --> 00:06:38.624
So, we disappear?

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:47.629
I'll see you tonight.

00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:51.306
I like the look.

00:06:52.474 --> 00:06:55.018
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.

00:06:55.352 --> 00:06:56.395
I need your help.

00:06:56.645 --> 00:06:57.646
It's nice to be needed.

00:06:58.021 --> 00:06:59.398
It's dangerous.

00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:01.775
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:07.990
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

00:07:08.365 --> 00:07:11.326
My contacts all say he's
building something.

00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.037
The amount of vibranium he made off with,

00:07:14.162 --> 00:07:15.622
I don't think it's just one thing.

00:07:15.747 --> 00:07:17.082
What about Ultron himself?

00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:19.543
Oh, he's easy to track. He's everywhere.

00:07:20.002 --> 00:07:22.379
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:25.841
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:27.175
Is he still going after launch codes?

00:07:27.426 --> 00:07:28.802
Yes, he is.

00:07:28.927 --> 00:07:30.387
But he's not making any headway.

00:07:30.512 --> 00:07:32.598
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

00:07:32.723 --> 00:07:35.309
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

00:07:35.392 --> 00:07:36.393
Nexus?

00:07:36.518 --> 00:07:38.145
It's the world Internet hub in Oslo.

00:07:38.604 --> 00:07:40.355
Every byte of data flows through there.

00:07:40.606 --> 00:07:41.648
Fastest access on Earth.

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:42.858
So, what did they say?

00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:44.860
He's fixated on the missiles.

00:07:45.068 --> 00:07:46.695
But the codes are constantly
being changed.

00:07:47.237 --> 00:07:48.238
By whom?

00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:50.699
Parties unknown.

00:07:50.866 --> 00:07:51.992
Do we have an ally?

00:07:52.117 --> 00:07:54.453
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

00:07:54.786 --> 00:07:56.622
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

00:07:56.747 --> 00:07:57.914
I might need to visit Oslo.

00:07:58.415 --> 00:07:59.541
Find our unknown.

00:07:59.708 --> 00:08:01.168
Well, this is good times, boss,

00:08:01.293 --> 00:08:02.544
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:03.670
you'd have more than that.

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:05.964
I do. I have you.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.592
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:10.052
Ears, everywhere else.

00:08:10.385 --> 00:08:13.388
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:16.391
Here we all are, back on Earth,

00:08:16.642 --> 00:08:18.393
with nothing but our wit

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.103
and our will to save the world.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.899
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:25.525
between him and his mission.

00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:27.819
And whether or not he admits it,

00:08:27.944 --> 00:08:30.697
his mission is global destruction.

00:08:31.907 --> 00:08:34.076
All this, laid in a grave.

00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:37.788
So stand.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.332
Outwit the platinum bastard.

00:08:40.957 --> 00:08:42.209
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

00:08:42.626 --> 00:08:43.710
You know what, Romanoff?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.254
So, what does he want?

00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:49.675
To become better.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.176
Better than us.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.929
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:56.139
The human form is inefficient.

00:08:56.264 --> 00:08:58.433
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

00:08:58.558 --> 00:09:00.519
But he keeps coming back to it.

00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:02.646
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race,

00:09:02.813 --> 00:09:04.106
you amazingly failed.

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:06.274
They don't need to be protected.

00:09:06.983 --> 00:09:08.485
They need to evolve.

00:09:10.654 --> 00:09:12.614
Ultron's going to evolve.

00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:13.824
How?

00:09:15.158 --> 00:09:17.828
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?

00:09:21.581 --> 00:09:23.250
It's beautiful.

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:26.586
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells,

00:09:26.712 --> 00:09:27.963
they're binding them.

00:09:28.422 --> 00:09:29.715
And S.H.I.E.L.D. never even thought to...

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:32.509
The most versatile substance on the planet,

00:09:32.634 --> 00:09:35.137
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

00:09:35.303 --> 00:09:36.430
Typical of humans.

00:09:36.638 --> 00:09:39.141
They scratch the surface and never think

00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:42.644
to look within.

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:54.614
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

00:09:54.823 --> 00:09:56.783
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit the Nexus.

00:09:56.908 --> 00:09:58.034
I'll join you as soon as I can.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.661
If Ultron's really building a body...

00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:01.455
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:02.706
Maybe all of us.

00:10:03.248 --> 00:10:05.041
An android designed by a robot.

00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:06.418
You know, I really miss the days

00:10:06.543 --> 00:10:08.670
when the weirdest thing science
ever created was me.

00:10:09.296 --> 00:10:10.922
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:12.340
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:14.342
She's all yours. Apparently.

00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:15.677
What are you gonna do?

00:10:15.844 --> 00:10:18.930
I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.

00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:24.019
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom

00:10:24.186 --> 00:10:25.979
as soon as I get back.

00:10:26.188 --> 00:10:28.857
Yeah, then you'll find another part
of the house to tear apart.

00:10:29.024 --> 00:10:30.192
No.

00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:32.360
It's the last project.

00:10:33.862 --> 00:10:34.863
I promise.

00:10:53.173 --> 00:10:54.674
So, this is it.

00:10:56.301 --> 00:10:58.553
The Water of Sight.

00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:03.266
In every realm, there's a reflection.

00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:05.811
If the water's spirits accept me,

00:11:05.977 --> 00:11:07.938
I can return to my dream

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.148
and find what I missed.

00:11:10.398 --> 00:11:14.236
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.

00:11:15.904 --> 00:11:17.656
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?

00:11:17.823 --> 00:11:18.865
He could be anywhere,

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.243
and as this is the center of everything,

00:11:21.368 --> 00:11:22.494
I'm just a guy looking for a needle

00:11:22.661 --> 00:11:24.746
in the world's biggest haystack.

00:11:25.747 --> 00:11:27.332
How do you find it?

00:11:27.749 --> 00:11:30.335
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

00:11:32.504 --> 00:11:33.588
<i>I'm decrypting nuclear codes</i>

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:35.090
<i>And you don't want me to</i>

00:11:37.384 --> 00:11:38.885
Come and get me.

00:11:51.231 --> 00:11:52.274
Wake up!

00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:00.115
Thor!

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:01.992
Extinction.

00:12:15.463 --> 00:12:17.591
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,

00:12:17.799 --> 00:12:20.218
but we can initiate
the consciousness stream.

00:12:20.802 --> 00:12:23.597
We're uploading your cerebral matrix

00:12:23.805 --> 00:12:25.015
now.

00:12:26.474 --> 00:12:28.059
I can read him.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.312
He's dreaming.

00:12:30.562 --> 00:12:32.355
I wouldn't call it dreams.

00:12:32.606 --> 00:12:34.441
It's Ultron's base consciousness.

00:12:34.649 --> 00:12:36.151
Informational noise. Soon...

00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:37.527
How soon?

00:12:37.777 --> 00:12:39.070
I'm not being pushy.

00:12:39.321 --> 00:12:40.947
We're imprinting a physical brain.

00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:42.574
There are no shortcuts.

00:12:42.824 --> 00:12:44.034
Even if your magic gem...

00:12:54.753 --> 00:12:56.129
How could you?

00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:57.213
How could I what?

00:12:57.464 --> 00:13:00.634
You said we would destroy the Avengers,

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.843
make a better world.

00:13:02.177 --> 00:13:03.219
It will be better.

00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:06.514
- When everyone is dead?
- That is not...

00:13:07.474 --> 00:13:11.311
The human race will have
every opportunity to improve.

00:13:11.853 --> 00:13:13.146
And if they don't?

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:14.481
Ask Noah.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.733
You are a madman.

00:13:16.858 --> 00:13:20.278
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events

00:13:20.445 --> 00:13:23.531
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

00:13:23.657 --> 00:13:25.784
When the Earth starts to settle,

00:13:26.326 --> 00:13:28.203
God throws a stone at it.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.664
And, believe me, he's winding up.

00:13:31.456 --> 00:13:32.624
We have to evolve.

00:13:33.208 --> 00:13:34.376
There's no room

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.336
for the weak.

00:13:36.544 --> 00:13:38.505
And who decides who's weak?

00:13:39.381 --> 00:13:41.132
Life.

00:13:41.758 --> 00:13:43.551
Life always decides.

00:13:46.513 --> 00:13:47.555
There's incoming.

00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:52.352
- The Quinjet. We have to move.
- That's not a problem.

00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:00.360
Wait, guys!

00:14:04.406 --> 00:14:05.699
They'll understand.

00:14:05.991 --> 00:14:08.118
When they see, they'll understand.

00:14:08.535 --> 00:14:11.788
I just need a little more time.

00:14:23.216 --> 00:14:25.301
Two minutes. Stay close.

00:14:32.517 --> 00:14:33.518
Dr. Cho!

00:14:37.439 --> 00:14:38.940
He's uploading himself into the body.

00:14:39.065 --> 00:14:40.108
Where?

00:14:41.901 --> 00:14:44.487
The real power is inside the Cradle.

00:14:44.571 --> 00:14:45.613
The gem,

00:14:46.364 --> 00:14:49.075
its power is uncontainable.

00:14:49.951 --> 00:14:51.619
You can't just blow it up.

00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:54.789
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.

00:14:54.914 --> 00:14:55.957
First, I have to find it.

00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:57.292
Go.

00:14:57.625 --> 00:14:58.877
<i>Did you guys copy that?</i>

00:14:59.044 --> 00:15:00.128
We did.

00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:02.714
I got a private jet taking off across town.

00:15:03.089 --> 00:15:04.340
No manifest.

00:15:04.814 --> 00:15:05.856
That could be him.

00:15:06.468 --> 00:15:08.053
There. It's a truck from the lab.

00:15:08.219 --> 00:15:09.387
Right above you, Cap.

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:11.473
On the loop by the bridge.

00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:13.099
It's them.

00:15:13.224 --> 00:15:14.642
You got three with the Cradle,
one in the cab.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:16.853
I could take out the driver.

00:15:16.978 --> 00:15:18.021
<i>Negative. That truck crashes,</i>

00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:19.731
the gem could level the city.

00:15:20.148 --> 00:15:21.399
<i>We need to draw out Ultron.</i>

00:15:31.117 --> 00:15:33.161
No, no, no, no.

00:15:35.194 --> 00:15:36.237
Leave me alone!

00:15:44.672 --> 00:15:46.341
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

00:15:46.508 --> 00:15:48.009
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

00:15:48.134 --> 00:15:49.177
You're not a match for him, Cap.

00:15:50.512 --> 00:15:51.596
Thanks, Barton.

00:16:14.327 --> 00:16:15.411
You know what's in that cradle?

00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:18.581
The power to make real change.

00:16:18.706 --> 00:16:20.125
And that terrifies you.

00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:21.334
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:25.713
Stop it.

00:16:36.558 --> 00:16:39.227
We got a window. Four, three...

00:16:39.894 --> 00:16:40.895
Give him hell.

00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:53.241
I'm always picking up after you boys.

00:16:54.909 --> 00:16:56.578
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.

00:16:56.911 --> 00:16:57.954
<i>Which way?</i>

00:16:58.163 --> 00:16:59.164
Hard right.

00:17:00.331 --> 00:17:01.416
Now.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.574
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.466
Come on!

00:17:51.966 --> 00:17:53.384
Clint, can you draw out the guards?

00:17:53.509 --> 00:17:54.552
Let's find out.

00:17:55.595 --> 00:17:56.638
Beep, beep!

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:35.677
They're heading back towards you.

00:18:35.843 --> 00:18:36.970
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

00:18:42.892 --> 00:18:45.520
<i>I'm going in.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?</i>

00:18:45.687 --> 00:18:47.563
What do you think I've been doing?

00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:33.276
<i>Okay, package is airborne.</i>

00:19:33.985 --> 00:19:35.069
I have a clean shot.

00:19:35.528 --> 00:19:36.863
Negative. I am still in the truck.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.031
- What the hell are you...
- Just be ready.

00:19:38.197 --> 00:19:39.198
I'm sending the package to you.

00:19:39.907 --> 00:19:40.950
How do you want me to take it?

00:19:41.326 --> 00:19:43.411
Uh, you might wish you hadn't asked that.

00:19:56.215 --> 00:19:57.925
Please, don't do this.

00:19:58.426 --> 00:20:00.011
What choice do we have?

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:09.270
I lost him!

00:20:09.437 --> 00:20:10.813
He's headed your way!

00:20:15.777 --> 00:20:16.819
Nat, we gotta go.

00:20:28.122 --> 00:20:29.916
Nat!

00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:34.962
Cap, you see Nat?

00:20:35.922 --> 00:20:38.466
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.967
Do you have eyes on Nat?

00:20:40.134 --> 00:20:41.135
<i>Go!</i>

00:20:43.137 --> 00:20:44.138
Damn it.

00:20:44.639 --> 00:20:45.723
Civilians in our path.

00:20:47.016 --> 00:20:48.518
Can you stop this thing?

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.724
I'm fine.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.518
I just need to take a minute.

00:21:31.018 --> 00:21:32.895
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.939
The Cradle. Did you get it?

00:21:35.106 --> 00:21:36.607
Stark will take care of it.

00:21:37.984 --> 00:21:38.985
No, he won't.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.739
You don't know what you're talking about.

00:21:43.823 --> 00:21:44.824
Stark's not crazy.

00:21:44.866 --> 00:21:46.993
He will do anything to make things right.

00:21:51.873 --> 00:21:53.166
Stark, come in.

00:21:53.666 --> 00:21:54.709
Stark.

00:21:56.043 --> 00:21:57.170
Anyone on comms.

00:21:57.295 --> 00:21:58.713
Ultron can't tell the difference

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.215
between saving the world
and destroying it.

00:22:03.134 --> 00:22:05.553
Where do you think he gets that?

00:22:07.763 --> 00:22:09.307
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.

00:22:09.432 --> 00:22:11.809
But she's alive, or Ultron would
be rubbing our faces in it.

00:22:11.934 --> 00:22:13.227
This is sealed tight.

00:22:13.394 --> 00:22:14.854
We're gonna need to access the program,

00:22:14.979 --> 00:22:16.898
break it down from within.

00:22:18.107 --> 00:22:19.400
Any chance Natasha might leave you

00:22:19.567 --> 00:22:20.902
a message outside the Internet?

00:22:20.943 --> 00:22:21.986
Old-school spy stuff?

00:22:22.487 --> 00:22:24.280
There are some nets I can cast.

00:22:24.405 --> 00:22:25.656
Yeah, I'll find her.

00:22:28.242 --> 00:22:29.994
I can work on tissue degeneration

00:22:30.119 --> 00:22:33.331
if you could fry whatever operational
system Cho implanted.

00:22:33.498 --> 00:22:34.582
Yeah, about that.

00:22:39.045 --> 00:22:40.046
No.

00:22:40.254 --> 00:22:42.089
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.

00:22:42.256 --> 00:22:46.260
Our ally, the guy protecting
the military's nuclear codes,

00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:49.263
I found him.

00:22:49.305 --> 00:22:50.431
<i>Hello, Dr. Banner.</i>

00:22:51.307 --> 00:22:53.559
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.

00:22:54.143 --> 00:22:57.772
He attacked him because he was
scared of what he can do.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.566
So Jarvis went underground.

00:23:00.691 --> 00:23:02.151
Scattered, dumped his memory.

00:23:02.777 --> 00:23:04.237
But not his protocols.

00:23:04.695 --> 00:23:08.115
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.

00:23:10.952 --> 00:23:15.748
So, you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?

00:23:15.873 --> 00:23:17.625
No! Of course not.

00:23:17.792 --> 00:23:19.460
I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.

00:23:21.879 --> 00:23:23.506
We're out of my field, here.

00:23:23.631 --> 00:23:25.633
You know bio-organics better than anyone.

00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:28.844
And you just assume that
Jarvis's operational matrix

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.388
can beat Ultron's?

00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:33.808
Jarvis has been beating him
from inside without knowing it.

00:23:33.975 --> 00:23:34.976
This is the opportunity.

00:23:35.059 --> 00:23:36.811
We can create Ultron's perfect self

00:23:36.978 --> 00:23:40.439
without the homicidal glitches he
thinks are his winning personality.

00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:42.650
- We have to.
- <i>I believe it's worth a go.</i>

00:23:45.236 --> 00:23:46.320
I'm in a loop!

00:23:46.487 --> 00:23:49.448
I'm caught in a time loop.
This is exactly where it all went wrong.

00:23:49.574 --> 00:23:51.450
I know. I know. I know
what everyone's gonna say.

00:23:51.576 --> 00:23:53.536
But they're already saying it.

00:23:54.078 --> 00:23:55.246
We're mad scientists.

00:23:55.997 --> 00:23:58.708
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.

00:23:59.709 --> 00:24:00.960
Make a stand.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.842
It's not a loop.

00:24:09.093 --> 00:24:10.845
It's the end of the line.

00:24:31.365 --> 00:24:33.492
I wasn't sure you would wake up.

00:24:33.618 --> 00:24:37.038
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.

00:24:37.204 --> 00:24:38.873
I don't have anyone else.

00:24:41.709 --> 00:24:45.338
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.

00:24:45.463 --> 00:24:47.006
Boom! The end.

00:24:47.465 --> 00:24:48.883
Start again.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.010
The world made clean

00:24:51.135 --> 00:24:53.429
for the new man to rebuild.

00:24:53.763 --> 00:24:55.890
I was meant to be new.

00:24:56.766 --> 00:24:59.352
I was meant to be beautiful.

00:24:59.935 --> 00:25:02.021
The world would have looked to the sky

00:25:02.146 --> 00:25:03.397
and seen hope,

00:25:03.773 --> 00:25:05.066
seen mercy.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.943
Instead, they'll look up in horror

00:25:08.069 --> 00:25:09.403
because of you.

00:25:09.612 --> 00:25:11.405
You've wounded me.

00:25:12.073 --> 00:25:13.741
I give you full marks for that.

00:25:14.408 --> 00:25:17.328
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...

00:25:22.541 --> 00:25:23.876
...just makes me stronger.

00:26:03.958 --> 00:26:06.127
This framework is not compatible.

00:26:06.293 --> 00:26:08.963
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.

00:26:09.088 --> 00:26:12.925
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.

00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:17.138
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?

00:26:17.304 --> 00:26:19.348
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.

00:26:19.473 --> 00:26:20.641
You don't know what you're doing.

00:26:20.808 --> 00:26:22.101
And you do?

00:26:22.476 --> 00:26:23.477
She's not in your head?

00:26:23.644 --> 00:26:25.271
I know you're angry.

00:26:25.396 --> 00:26:26.772
Oh, we're way past that.

00:26:26.897 --> 00:26:29.316
I could choke the life out of you
and never change a shade.

00:26:29.567 --> 00:26:31.193
Banner, after everything
that's happened...

00:26:31.318 --> 00:26:32.695
It's nothing compared to what's coming!

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.156
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!

00:26:38.492 --> 00:26:39.869
No, no. Go on.

00:26:40.828 --> 00:26:42.747
You were saying?

00:26:49.003 --> 00:26:50.045
Pietro!

00:26:50.588 --> 00:26:51.672
What?

00:26:52.089 --> 00:26:53.632
You didn't see that coming?

00:26:55.843 --> 00:26:57.011
I'm rerouting the upload.

00:27:03.309 --> 00:27:05.060
Go ahead, piss me off.

00:27:17.406 --> 00:27:18.532
Wait!

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.452
I am sorry. That was

00:28:46.453 --> 00:28:47.830
odd.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.331
Thank you.

00:28:54.253 --> 00:28:55.296
Thor.

00:28:56.797 --> 00:28:59.383
- You helped create this?
- I've had a vision.

00:28:59.633 --> 00:29:03.345
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope
of life, and at its center is that.

00:29:04.305 --> 00:29:05.306
What? The gem?

00:29:05.472 --> 00:29:08.058
It's the Mind Stone.
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.

00:29:08.183 --> 00:29:09.435
The greatest power in the universe,

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.729
unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.

00:29:11.854 --> 00:29:13.814
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.

00:29:13.981 --> 00:29:16.442
Oh, it's definitely the end times.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:17.818
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

00:29:17.943 --> 00:29:19.194
Not alone.

00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:21.530
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?

00:29:21.655 --> 00:29:24.325
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

00:29:24.825 --> 00:29:26.619
to create something new.

00:29:26.827 --> 00:29:28.537
I think I've had my fill of new.

00:29:28.662 --> 00:29:30.956
You think I'm a child of Ultron.

00:29:31.332 --> 00:29:32.583
You're not?

00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:35.336
I'm not Ultron.

00:29:35.961 --> 00:29:38.172
I am not Jarvis. I am...

00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:41.675
I am.

00:29:43.594 --> 00:29:44.720
I looked in your head

00:29:45.429 --> 00:29:47.181
and saw annihilation.

00:29:47.348 --> 00:29:48.724
Look again.

00:29:48.849 --> 00:29:50.309
Her seal of approval means jack to me.

00:29:50.851 --> 00:29:52.853
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.022
Ultron himself, they all came
from the Mind Stone.

00:29:55.189 --> 00:29:57.358
And they're nothing compared
to what it can unleash.

00:29:57.524 --> 00:29:59.026
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?

00:30:00.486 --> 00:30:01.654
Are you?

00:30:02.529 --> 00:30:03.948
On our side?

00:30:05.824 --> 00:30:07.701
I don't think it's that simple.

00:30:07.868 --> 00:30:10.329
Well, it better get real simple real soon.

00:30:11.497 --> 00:30:13.582
I am on the side of life.

00:30:13.832 --> 00:30:15.209
Ultron isn't.

00:30:15.793 --> 00:30:17.211
He will end it all.

00:30:17.378 --> 00:30:19.296
What's he waiting for?

00:30:19.421 --> 00:30:20.422
- You.
- Where?

00:30:20.881 --> 00:30:22.049
Sokovia.

00:30:22.174 --> 00:30:23.258
He's got Nat there, too.

00:30:25.386 --> 00:30:27.054
If we're wrong about you,

00:30:29.723 --> 00:30:31.558
if you're the monster that
Ultron made you to be...

00:30:32.226 --> 00:30:33.769
What will you do?

00:30:40.401 --> 00:30:42.486
I don't want to kill Ultron.

00:30:42.861 --> 00:30:46.198
He's unique and he's in pain.

00:30:47.741 --> 00:30:50.327
But that pain will roll over the Earth.

00:30:50.869 --> 00:30:53.163
So, he must be destroyed.

00:30:53.414 --> 00:30:56.333
Every form he's built, every trace
of his presence on the net.

00:30:56.583 --> 00:30:58.252
We have to act now.

00:30:58.669 --> 00:31:02.589
And not one of us can
do it without the others.

00:31:04.591 --> 00:31:06.510
Maybe I am a monster.

00:31:06.677 --> 00:31:08.929
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

00:31:10.097 --> 00:31:11.682
I'm not what you are,

00:31:12.349 --> 00:31:14.518
and not what you intended.

00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:17.771
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.

00:31:18.022 --> 00:31:19.440
But we need to go.

00:31:34.246 --> 00:31:35.414
Right.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.291
Well done.

00:31:39.043 --> 00:31:40.085
Three minutes.

00:31:40.794 --> 00:31:42.421
Get what you need.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.313
<i>Good evening, boss.</i>

00:32:04.485 --> 00:32:06.153
<i>No way we all get through this.</i>

00:32:06.278 --> 00:32:08.197
<i>If even one tin soldier
is left standing, we've lost.</i>

00:32:09.073 --> 00:32:10.449
There's gonna be blood on the floor.

00:32:10.574 --> 00:32:11.950
I got no plans tomorrow night.

00:32:12.076 --> 00:32:13.202
I get first crack at the big guy.

00:32:13.827 --> 00:32:15.329
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

00:32:15.454 --> 00:32:17.831
That's true. He hates you the most.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.339
Ultron knows we're coming.

00:32:25.589 --> 00:32:27.800
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.052
And that's what we signed up for.

00:32:30.302 --> 00:32:32.846
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

00:32:33.972 --> 00:32:35.432
<i>So our priority</i>

00:32:36.141 --> 00:32:37.226
<i>is getting them out.</i>

00:32:37.476 --> 00:32:40.395
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

00:32:48.195 --> 00:32:49.655
Get off your asses.

00:32:50.864 --> 00:32:52.783
<i>All they want is to live
their lives in peace.</i>

00:32:53.827 --> 00:32:55.078
<i>And that's not gonna happen today.</i>

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.080
<i>But we can do our best to protect them.</i>

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.863
<i>And we can get the job done.</i>

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.004
<i>We find out what Ultron's been building,</i>

00:33:06.964 --> 00:33:08.549
<i>we find Romanoff</i>

00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:10.884
<i>and we clear the field.</i>

00:33:11.968 --> 00:33:13.887
<i>Keep the fight between us.</i>

00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:23.426
Ultron thinks we're monsters.

00:33:23.897 --> 00:33:26.275
That we're what's wrong with the world.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.735
This isn't just about beating him.

00:33:29.236 --> 00:33:31.280
It's about whether he's right.

00:33:37.744 --> 00:33:38.787
Natasha!

00:33:39.913 --> 00:33:40.914
Natasha!

00:33:41.081 --> 00:33:42.166
Bruce?

00:33:43.584 --> 00:33:44.585
You all right?

00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:45.794
Yeah.

00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:47.629
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.

00:33:47.754 --> 00:33:49.715
I don't suppose you found a key
lying around somewhere.

00:33:50.257 --> 00:33:52.342
Yeah. I did.

00:33:58.765 --> 00:33:59.933
So what's our play?

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.476
I'm here to get you to safety.

00:34:02.227 --> 00:34:04.771
- Job's not finished.
- We could help with the evacuation,

00:34:04.938 --> 00:34:06.773
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

00:34:08.108 --> 00:34:09.276
And you've done plenty.

00:34:11.695 --> 00:34:13.155
Our fight is over.

00:34:14.573 --> 00:34:16.783
So, we just disappear?

00:34:20.954 --> 00:34:22.789
Come on.

00:34:27.586 --> 00:34:29.838
<i>Your man's in the church, boss.</i>

00:34:29.963 --> 00:34:31.798
<i>I think he's waiting for you.</i>

00:34:35.886 --> 00:34:37.930
Come to confess your sins?

00:34:38.055 --> 00:34:39.264
I don't know. How much time you got?

00:34:39.431 --> 00:34:40.933
More than you.

00:34:42.142 --> 00:34:43.185
Uh...

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.104
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.523
You're looking...
I don't wanna say "puffy."

00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:50.359
You're stalling to protect the people.

00:34:50.776 --> 00:34:53.612
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?

00:34:53.904 --> 00:34:56.406
I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.

00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:02.204
What?

00:35:03.121 --> 00:35:05.457
You think you were the only one stalling?

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:07.793
<i>There's the rest of the vibranium.</i>

00:35:07.918 --> 00:35:09.336
<i>Function, still unclear.</i>

00:35:09.503 --> 00:35:10.671
This is how you end, Tony.

00:35:11.964 --> 00:35:13.715
This is peace in my time.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.483
Go!

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:38.365
Get off the bridge!

00:35:42.536 --> 00:35:43.537
Run!

00:35:45.539 --> 00:35:47.332
Ultron.

00:35:52.838 --> 00:35:54.047
My Vision.

00:35:54.298 --> 00:35:56.550
They really did take everything from me.

00:35:56.717 --> 00:35:58.760
You set the terms. You can change them.

00:35:58.885 --> 00:36:00.137
All right.

00:36:24.328 --> 00:36:25.579
Friday, the Vision?

00:36:25.704 --> 00:36:27.789
<i>Boss, it's working.
He's burning Ultron out of the net.</i>

00:36:27.914 --> 00:36:28.999
<i>He won't escape through there.</i>

00:36:34.212 --> 00:36:35.505
You shut me out.

00:36:36.006 --> 00:36:37.215
You think I care?

00:36:39.217 --> 00:36:40.385
You take away my world,

00:36:41.261 --> 00:36:43.013
I take away yours.

00:37:27.557 --> 00:37:28.767
Friday.

00:37:28.892 --> 00:37:31.311
<i>Sokovia is going for a ride.</i>

00:37:43.824 --> 00:37:45.325
Do you see

00:37:45.784 --> 00:37:47.327
the beauty of it?

00:37:47.911 --> 00:37:49.746
The inevitability.

00:37:49.996 --> 00:37:53.250
You rise, only to fall.

00:37:56.002 --> 00:37:58.839
<i>You, Avengers, you are my meteor.</i>

00:37:59.756 --> 00:38:01.466
<i>My swift and terrible sword.</i>

00:38:01.675 --> 00:38:03.176
<i>And the earth will crack</i>

00:38:03.343 --> 00:38:05.262
<i>with the weight of your failure.</i>

00:38:06.972 --> 00:38:10.725
<i>Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.</i>

00:38:11.184 --> 00:38:12.602
<i>It means nothing.</i>

00:38:13.687 --> 00:38:15.021
<i>When the dust settles,</i>

00:38:15.188 --> 00:38:17.065
<i>the only thing living in this world</i>

00:38:17.607 --> 00:38:18.608
<i>will be metal.</i>

00:38:23.155 --> 00:38:24.739
We gotta move.

00:38:25.031 --> 00:38:26.074
You're not gonna turn green?

00:38:26.366 --> 00:38:28.201
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.

00:38:29.453 --> 00:38:30.704
I adore you.

00:38:39.379 --> 00:38:41.298
But I need the other guy.

00:38:46.136 --> 00:38:47.888
Let's finish the job.

00:39:04.696 --> 00:39:06.072
I really hope this makes us even.

00:39:08.408 --> 00:39:10.452
Now go be a hero.

00:39:18.919 --> 00:39:20.837
<i>The vibranium core's
got a magnetic field.</i>

00:39:21.004 --> 00:39:23.006
<i>That's what's keeping the rock together.</i>

00:39:23.131 --> 00:39:24.216
If it drops?

00:39:24.257 --> 00:39:25.550
<i>Right now, the impact
will kill thousands.</i>

00:39:25.634 --> 00:39:28.345
<i>Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.</i>

00:39:32.682 --> 00:39:34.768
<i>That building's not clear. The 10th floor.</i>

00:39:39.648 --> 00:39:40.649
Hi.

00:39:41.775 --> 00:39:44.110
Okay. Get in the tub!

00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:52.786
<i>I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.</i>

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.790
Cap, you got incoming.

00:39:56.957 --> 00:39:58.583
Incoming already came in.

00:40:01.294 --> 00:40:03.755
Stark, you worry about bringing
the city back down safely.

00:40:04.464 --> 00:40:06.299
<i>The rest of us have one job,</i>

00:40:06.424 --> 00:40:07.592
<i>tear these things apart.</i>

00:40:07.926 --> 00:40:09.511
<i>You get hurt, hurt them back.</i>

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.346
<i>You get killed,</i>

00:40:12.389 --> 00:40:13.682
walk it off.

00:40:48.133 --> 00:40:49.301
Go, go, go!

00:40:55.015 --> 00:40:56.766
How could I let this happen?

00:40:56.891 --> 00:40:58.935
- Hey, hey, you okay?
- This is all our fault.

00:40:59.102 --> 00:41:01.229
Hey, look at me.
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.

00:41:01.354 --> 00:41:02.397
Who cares?

00:41:02.522 --> 00:41:04.024
Are you up for this?

00:41:04.149 --> 00:41:05.233
Are you?

00:41:05.483 --> 00:41:06.526
Look, I just need to know.

00:41:06.693 --> 00:41:08.862
Because the city is flying.

00:41:09.195 --> 00:41:11.031
Okay. Look, the city is flying,

00:41:11.156 --> 00:41:13.074
we're fighting an army of robots,

00:41:13.992 --> 00:41:15.201
and I have a bow and arrow.

00:41:15.368 --> 00:41:16.453
None of this makes sense.

00:41:19.706 --> 00:41:21.833
But I'm going back out there
because it's my job.

00:41:22.709 --> 00:41:25.378
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.

00:41:25.503 --> 00:41:28.506
It doesn't matter what you
did or what you were.

00:41:28.715 --> 00:41:31.301
If you go out there, you fight,
and you fight to kill.

00:41:32.344 --> 00:41:34.596
Stay in here, you're good.
I'll send your brother to come find you.

00:41:35.055 --> 00:41:36.890
But if you step out that door,

00:41:37.807 --> 00:41:38.808
you are an Avenger.

00:41:43.688 --> 00:41:45.482
All right. Good chat.

00:41:49.235 --> 00:41:50.278
Yeah, the city is flying.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:25.438
I got you!

00:42:25.772 --> 00:42:26.981
Just look at me!

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.073
<i>You can't save them all.</i>

00:42:36.449 --> 00:42:37.492
You'll never...

00:42:38.743 --> 00:42:41.204
"Never" what? You didn't finish!

00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:46.501
What, were you napping?

00:43:07.981 --> 00:43:09.065
Thor.

00:43:11.693 --> 00:43:13.278
You're bothering me.

00:43:21.327 --> 00:43:22.328
Ow!

00:43:48.688 --> 00:43:49.856
All right, we're all clear here.

00:43:50.023 --> 00:43:51.065
We are not clear!

00:43:51.191 --> 00:43:52.609
We are very not clear!

00:43:55.695 --> 00:43:56.988
All right, coming to you.

00:43:57.489 --> 00:43:59.574
Keep up, old man!

00:44:01.326 --> 00:44:02.827
Nobody would know.

00:44:03.661 --> 00:44:04.704
Nobody.

00:44:06.664 --> 00:44:09.584
"The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him.

00:44:09.709 --> 00:44:11.586
"Yeah, he'll be missed,
that quick little bastard.

00:44:11.669 --> 00:44:12.670
"I miss him already."

00:44:28.228 --> 00:44:29.395
Hold your fire!

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.323
Romanoff!

00:44:40.824 --> 00:44:41.825
Thanks!

00:44:51.251 --> 00:44:52.836
<i>The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.</i>

00:44:52.961 --> 00:44:55.129
<i>Touch them, they'll go
full reverse thrust.</i>

00:44:55.255 --> 00:44:56.673
<i>The city's not coming down slow.</i>

00:44:56.798 --> 00:44:57.924
Spire is vibranium.

00:44:58.049 --> 00:44:59.175
If I get Thor to hit it...

00:44:59.425 --> 00:45:00.802
<i>It will crack. That's not enough.</i>

00:45:00.927 --> 00:45:02.428
<i>The impact would still be devastating.</i>

00:45:02.595 --> 00:45:03.930
Maybe if we can cap the other end.

00:45:04.138 --> 00:45:05.765
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

00:45:05.932 --> 00:45:07.267
<i>That could vaporize the city.</i>

00:45:08.268 --> 00:45:10.103
<i>And everyone on it.</i>

00:45:15.942 --> 00:45:17.819
The next wave is gonna hit any minute.

00:45:17.944 --> 00:45:19.904
- What do you got, Stark?
- <i>Huh? Nothing great.</i>

00:45:20.738 --> 00:45:22.949
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

00:45:23.074 --> 00:45:24.367
That'll keep it from impacting the surface,

00:45:24.492 --> 00:45:25.535
if you guys can get clear.

00:45:25.785 --> 00:45:27.662
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.

00:45:27.912 --> 00:45:30.790
<i>Impact radius is getting
bigger every second.</i>

00:45:30.999 --> 00:45:32.375
<i>We're gonna have to make a choice.</i>

00:45:33.126 --> 00:45:34.627
Cap, these people are going nowhere.

00:45:35.461 --> 00:45:37.922
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not till everyone's safe.

00:45:38.673 --> 00:45:41.676
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.

00:45:41.926 --> 00:45:43.678
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.

00:45:43.928 --> 00:45:45.346
I didn't say we should leave.

00:45:48.182 --> 00:45:50.018
There's worse ways to go.

00:45:55.481 --> 00:45:57.901
Where else am I gonna
get a view like this?

00:45:58.818 --> 00:46:01.404
<i>Glad you like the view, Romanoff.</i>

00:46:01.529 --> 00:46:03.114
<i>It's about to get better.</i>

00:46:27.221 --> 00:46:28.431
<i>Nice, right?</i>

00:46:28.556 --> 00:46:31.017
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.

00:46:31.142 --> 00:46:32.810
She's dusty, but she'll do.

00:46:33.144 --> 00:46:34.604
Fury, you son of a bitch.

00:46:34.771 --> 00:46:37.023
Ooh! You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

00:46:37.148 --> 00:46:39.359
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

00:46:39.525 --> 00:46:41.027
Lifeboats secure to deploy.

00:46:41.152 --> 00:46:43.821
Disengage in three, two...

00:46:45.031 --> 00:46:46.032
Take them out.

00:46:55.708 --> 00:46:57.251
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

00:46:57.377 --> 00:46:59.796
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.

00:47:01.464 --> 00:47:02.882
This is not so bad.

00:47:06.177 --> 00:47:07.470
Let's load them up.

00:47:12.892 --> 00:47:14.227
Sir, we have multiple bogies

00:47:14.394 --> 00:47:16.729
converging on our starboard flank.

00:47:17.063 --> 00:47:18.272
Show 'em what we got.

00:47:18.648 --> 00:47:19.649
You're up.

00:47:24.904 --> 00:47:25.905
Yes!

00:47:26.155 --> 00:47:27.907
Now this is gonna be a good story.

00:47:30.576 --> 00:47:32.620
Yup. If you live to tell it.

00:47:32.787 --> 00:47:34.789
You think I can't hold my own?

00:47:34.914 --> 00:47:36.457
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

00:47:36.582 --> 00:47:38.459
You had to make it weird.

00:47:43.297 --> 00:47:46.259
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.

00:48:03.192 --> 00:48:04.610
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

00:48:04.944 --> 00:48:06.029
Let's go, everyone!

00:48:08.573 --> 00:48:10.575
Number six boat is topped and locked...

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.077
Or stocked... Topped...

00:48:13.619 --> 00:48:15.038
It's full of people.

00:48:16.789 --> 00:48:17.874
Incoming!

00:48:20.918 --> 00:48:21.961
Oh, God!

00:48:32.472 --> 00:48:33.723
<i>You think you're saving anyone?</i>

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.602
I turn that key and drop
this rock a little early

00:48:37.769 --> 00:48:39.854
and it's still billions dead.

00:48:40.313 --> 00:48:41.481
Even you can't stop that.

00:48:41.647 --> 00:48:44.025
I am Thor, son of Odin,

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.486
and as long as there
is life in my breast...

00:48:46.611 --> 00:48:50.156
I am running out of things to say!
Are you ready?

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:58.956
It's terribly well-balanced.

00:48:59.332 --> 00:49:02.794
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...

00:49:03.753 --> 00:49:06.380
I got it. Create a heat seal.

00:49:06.839 --> 00:49:07.882
I could...

00:49:07.965 --> 00:49:10.343
I could supercharge the spire from below.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:11.552
<i>Running numbers.</i>

00:49:21.687 --> 00:49:23.356
<i>A heat seal could work with enough power.</i>

00:49:23.856 --> 00:49:25.858
- Thor, I got a plan.
- <i>We're out of time.</i>

00:49:26.025 --> 00:49:27.235
<i>They're coming for the core.</i>

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.153
Rhodey, get the rest of the people
on board that carrier.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.532
- On it.
- Avengers, time to work for a living.

00:49:41.624 --> 00:49:42.875
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

00:49:44.377 --> 00:49:45.419
Romanoff.

00:49:45.545 --> 00:49:48.005
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."

00:49:48.047 --> 00:49:49.132
<i>Relax, shellhead.</i>

00:49:49.507 --> 00:49:50.967
Not all of us can fly.

00:49:56.722 --> 00:49:58.391
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

00:49:58.558 --> 00:50:00.726
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.

00:50:05.314 --> 00:50:07.316
Is that the best you can do?

00:50:17.201 --> 00:50:18.744
You had to ask.

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:21.205
This is the best I can do.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:22.957
This is exactly what I wanted.

00:50:23.332 --> 00:50:24.625
All of you

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.419
against all of me.

00:50:26.669 --> 00:50:28.880
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

00:50:29.755 --> 00:50:31.591
Well, like the old man said...

00:50:32.925 --> 00:50:33.926
Together.

00:52:02.848 --> 00:52:05.226
You know, with the benefit of hindsight...

00:52:14.527 --> 00:52:15.528
They'll try to leave the city.

00:52:15.695 --> 00:52:17.363
We can't let them, not even one. Rhodey.

00:52:17.738 --> 00:52:18.781
I'm on it.

00:52:19.198 --> 00:52:20.574
Oh, no. I didn't say you could leave.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.286
War Machine coming at you! Right...

00:52:29.667 --> 00:52:31.043
Okay, what?

00:52:31.294 --> 00:52:33.296
We gotta move out.
Even I can tell the air is getting thin.

00:52:33.421 --> 00:52:34.714
You guys get to the boats.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.674
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.

00:52:36.882 --> 00:52:39.302
- What about the core?
- I'll protect it.

00:52:41.137 --> 00:52:42.263
It's my job.

00:52:43.389 --> 00:52:44.557
Nat.

00:52:44.849 --> 00:52:45.850
This way.

00:52:50.229 --> 00:52:51.397
Get the people on the boats.

00:52:51.564 --> 00:52:52.565
I'm not going to leave you here.

00:52:52.732 --> 00:52:53.774
I can handle this.

00:52:56.068 --> 00:52:57.320
Come back for me when
everyone else is off.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:59.030
Not before.

00:52:59.697 --> 00:53:00.781
You understand?

00:53:01.824 --> 00:53:03.534
You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.

00:53:03.909 --> 00:53:04.994
Go.

00:53:06.579 --> 00:53:08.080
<i>Boss, power levels are way below...</i>

00:53:08.205 --> 00:53:10.374
Reroute everything.
We get one shot at this.

00:53:15.338 --> 00:53:16.589
I know what I need to do.

00:53:16.922 --> 00:53:17.965
The dining room.

00:53:18.257 --> 00:53:19.425
If I knock out that east wall,

00:53:20.176 --> 00:53:21.719
it'd make a nice workspace
for Laura, huh?

00:53:23.262 --> 00:53:24.430
Put up some baffling.

00:53:24.555 --> 00:53:26.724
She can't hear the kids running around.
What do you think?

00:53:26.891 --> 00:53:27.975
You guys always eat
in the kitchen anyway.

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:29.643
No one eats in a dining room.

00:53:35.316 --> 00:53:36.359
We don't have a lot of time.

00:53:37.026 --> 00:53:38.986
So get your ass on a boat.

00:53:51.957 --> 00:53:53.084
Hey, big guy.

00:53:54.877 --> 00:53:56.629
Sun's getting real low.

00:53:57.171 --> 00:53:59.799
You're safe now.
You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.

00:54:02.343 --> 00:54:03.928
Secure your gear, find a seat.

00:54:04.053 --> 00:54:05.304
Costel!

00:54:06.389 --> 00:54:07.515
We were in the market.

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:08.682
Costel!

00:54:23.406 --> 00:54:25.449
Thor, I'm gonna need you
back in the church.

00:54:25.574 --> 00:54:26.992
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

00:54:27.451 --> 00:54:29.662
- Everyone else is on the carrier.
- <i>You know, this works,</i>

00:54:30.329 --> 00:54:31.705
we maybe don't walk away.

00:54:32.456 --> 00:54:33.457
Maybe not.

00:54:52.685 --> 00:54:56.188
<i>I got no strings, so I have fun</i>

00:54:56.689 --> 00:54:59.358
<i>I'm not tied up to anyone</i>

00:55:00.943 --> 00:55:02.278
Come on. Time to go.

00:55:34.727 --> 00:55:36.770
You didn't see that coming?

00:56:33.035 --> 00:56:34.787
Oh, for God's sake.

00:56:51.095 --> 00:56:52.846
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!

00:57:05.317 --> 00:57:06.318
No, no, I'm fine.

00:57:06.485 --> 00:57:07.486
Fine.

00:57:09.321 --> 00:57:11.365
It's been a long day.

00:57:25.921 --> 00:57:27.131
Wanda.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.093
If you stay here, you'll die.

00:57:32.678 --> 00:57:34.054
I just did.

00:57:34.847 --> 00:57:36.599
Do you know how it felt?

00:57:50.696 --> 00:57:53.032
It felt like that.

00:58:28.025 --> 00:58:29.693
Thor, on my mark.

00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:45.751
Now!

00:59:13.779 --> 00:59:16.198
<i>Hey, big guy. We did it.</i>

00:59:17.241 --> 00:59:18.909
<i>The job is finished.</i>

00:59:19.118 --> 00:59:21.787
<i>Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?</i>

00:59:26.125 --> 00:59:27.918
We can't track you in stealth mode.

00:59:30.045 --> 00:59:32.172
<i>So help me out. I need you...</i>

01:00:17.843 --> 01:00:18.844
You're afraid.

01:00:19.845 --> 01:00:20.929
Of you?

01:00:21.597 --> 01:00:22.765
Of death.

01:00:23.474 --> 01:00:25.267
You're the last one.

01:00:25.517 --> 01:00:27.978
You were supposed to be the last.

01:00:28.187 --> 01:00:30.481
Stark asked for a savior

01:00:31.523 --> 01:00:33.192
and settled for a slave.

01:00:33.317 --> 01:00:35.736
I suppose we are both disappointments.

01:00:38.197 --> 01:00:39.448
I suppose we are.

01:00:40.157 --> 01:00:41.325
Humans are odd.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.789
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.875
and try to control what won't be.

01:00:51.585 --> 01:00:54.046
But there is grace in their failings.

01:00:54.379 --> 01:00:56.298
I think you missed that.

01:00:56.965 --> 01:00:58.050
They're doomed.

01:00:58.967 --> 01:01:00.010
Yes.

01:01:04.223 --> 01:01:07.142
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.

01:01:09.228 --> 01:01:11.230
It's a privilege to be among them.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.982
You're unbearably naive.

01:01:14.274 --> 01:01:15.484
Well...

01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:19.613
I was born yesterday.

01:02:32.227 --> 01:02:34.313
<i>Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!</i>

01:02:35.689 --> 01:02:36.690
Fat.

01:02:37.816 --> 01:02:39.067
One of our tech boys flagged this.

01:02:40.277 --> 01:02:42.446
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

01:02:43.572 --> 01:02:45.073
Could be the Quinjet.

01:02:45.449 --> 01:02:47.117
But with Stark's stealth tech,

01:02:47.242 --> 01:02:48.785
we still can't track the damn thing.

01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:51.705
Right.

01:02:52.164 --> 01:02:54.416
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

01:02:55.667 --> 01:02:57.544
He'll send a postcard.

01:02:57.836 --> 01:02:59.546
"Wish you were here."

01:03:01.506 --> 01:03:04.801
You sent me to recruit him way back when.

01:03:06.637 --> 01:03:09.181
Did you know then what was gonna happen?

01:03:11.391 --> 01:03:13.310
You never know.

01:03:13.518 --> 01:03:17.022
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.

01:03:17.522 --> 01:03:18.982
I got a great team.

01:03:20.108 --> 01:03:22.069
Nothing lasts forever.

01:03:22.361 --> 01:03:24.404
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

01:03:24.655 --> 01:03:27.991
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.

01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:33.080
<i>The rules have changed.</i>

01:03:33.288 --> 01:03:34.873
We're dealing with something new.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.333
Oh, the Vision is artificial intelligence.

01:03:36.458 --> 01:03:38.377
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?

01:03:38.543 --> 01:03:40.379
No, it's not like a person
lifting the hammer.

01:03:40.629 --> 01:03:42.297
Right, different rules for us.

01:03:42.506 --> 01:03:43.548
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.

01:03:43.757 --> 01:03:46.635
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.

01:03:47.552 --> 01:03:49.638
It's safe with the Vision.

01:03:49.888 --> 01:03:52.391
And these days, safe is in short supply.

01:03:54.434 --> 01:03:56.395
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.313
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

01:03:58.438 --> 01:04:00.232
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

01:04:00.399 --> 01:04:01.900
Not if you don't leave.

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:03.860
I have no choice.

01:04:04.111 --> 01:04:06.279
The Mind Stone is the fourth
of the Infinity Stones

01:04:06.405 --> 01:04:07.781
to show up in the last few years.

01:04:07.906 --> 01:04:09.491
It's not a coincidence.

01:04:10.325 --> 01:04:12.077
Someone has been playing
an intricate game

01:04:12.244 --> 01:04:13.870
and has made pawns of us.

01:04:13.996 --> 01:04:15.872
And once all these pieces
are in position...

01:04:15.998 --> 01:04:17.416
Triple Yahtzee.

01:04:17.624 --> 01:04:19.084
You think you can find out what's coming?

01:04:19.209 --> 01:04:20.293
I do.

01:04:21.128 --> 01:04:22.587
Besides this one,

01:04:22.713 --> 01:04:25.090
there's nothing that can't be explained.

01:04:32.389 --> 01:04:34.933
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.

01:04:38.061 --> 01:04:40.689
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.

01:04:40.814 --> 01:04:42.357
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

01:04:44.568 --> 01:04:46.194
I will miss you, Tony.

01:04:46.445 --> 01:04:47.446
Yeah?

01:04:47.612 --> 01:04:50.032
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

01:04:50.282 --> 01:04:52.451
Maybe I should take a page
out of Barton's book.

01:04:52.617 --> 01:04:55.537
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.

01:04:56.329 --> 01:04:57.497
The simple life.

01:04:57.748 --> 01:05:00.042
- You'll get there one day.
- I don't know.

01:05:00.292 --> 01:05:02.669
Family, stability...

01:05:03.837 --> 01:05:06.965
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.

01:05:08.467 --> 01:05:10.302
I think someone else came out.

01:05:14.264 --> 01:05:15.348
You all right?

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.478
I'm home.

01:05:27.402 --> 01:05:30.155
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?

01:05:30.322 --> 01:05:31.656
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

01:05:31.823 --> 01:05:34.826
I thought you and Tony were still
gazing into each other's eyes.

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:35.952
How do we look?

01:05:36.203 --> 01:05:38.497
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

01:05:38.622 --> 01:05:40.332
We got some hitters.

01:05:40.499 --> 01:05:42.876
They're good. They're not a team.

01:05:43.043 --> 01:05:44.669
Let's beat them into shape.

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:04.769
Avengers...

01:06:21.609 --> 01:06:24.028
I present to you,

01:06:24.387 --> 01:06:27.891
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

01:06:33.679 --> 01:06:38.225
Asgardians, it's an honor.

01:06:41.866 --> 01:06:43.951
You know why we're here.

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.590
Of course.

01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:52.676
But, if I may ask,

01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:56.722
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?

01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:59.767
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.

01:06:59.892 --> 01:07:03.437
It is not wise to keep two
Infinity Stones so close together.

01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:06.565
That's very wise.

01:07:16.408 --> 01:07:17.785
I can assure you,

01:07:19.036 --> 01:07:24.249
it will be absolutely safe here,

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.962
in my collection.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:32.549
See that it is.

01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:53.612
One down.

01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:57.458
Five to go.
