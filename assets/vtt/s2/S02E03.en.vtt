WEBVTT

00:00:10.658 --> 00:00:12.785
<i>As difficult as this is to accept,</i>

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.164
<i>Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:19.158
Sir...

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:21.901
we found him.
He's at 21st and F.

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:32.068
<i>A-team approaching target.</i>

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:34.806
Go!

00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:37.106
- Everybody on the floor!
- Everybody on the floor.

00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:39.055
Show me your hands!
Show them now!

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:41.755
Everybody get down on the ground
and show me your hands now!

00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:34.053
Where is Tony Stark?

00:02:02.607 --> 00:02:03.938
<i>Stark secure server.</i>

00:02:04.047 --> 00:02:06.095
<i>Retinal scan verified.</i>

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.328
<i>Pepper, it's me.</i>

00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:10.331
<i>I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time.</i>

00:02:10.407 --> 00:02:13.456
<i>So... first off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.</i>

00:02:13.527 --> 00:02:15.894
<i>That was selfish and stupid
and it won't happen again.</i>

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:20.136
<i>Also, it's Christmastime
and the rabbit's too big.</i>

00:02:20.213 --> 00:02:22.215
<i>Done. Sorry.</i>

00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:25.297
<i>And I'm sorry in advance</i>

00:02:25.373 --> 00:02:27.341
<i>because I can't come home yet.</i>

00:02:28.373 --> 00:02:30.580
<i>I need to find this guy.</i>

00:02:30.653 --> 00:02:33.497
You gotta stay safe, that's all I know.

00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:36.903
I just stole a poncho
from a wooden Indian.

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:02.419
Let's get you comfy.

00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:07.136
You happy now?

00:03:17.493 --> 00:03:18.540
Freeze!

00:03:20.493 --> 00:03:22.097
Don't move.

00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:24.138
You got me.

00:03:25.693 --> 00:03:27.377
Nice potato gun.

00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:29.059
Barrel's a little long.

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:33.054
Between that and the wide gauge
it's gonna diminish your FPS.

00:03:37.213 --> 00:03:38.453
And now you're out of ammo.

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:41.023
What's that thing on your chest?

00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:44.216
It's an electromagnet.

00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:46.253
You should know,
you got a box of them right here.

00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:47.814
What does it power?

00:03:56.813 --> 00:03:58.736
Oh, my God.

00:03:59.893 --> 00:04:01.019
That...

00:04:03.813 --> 00:04:05.463
That's...
Is that Iron Man?

00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:07.098
Technically, I am.

00:04:07.693 --> 00:04:09.821
Technically, you're dead.

00:04:11.813 --> 00:04:12.860
Valid point.

00:04:13.173 --> 00:04:14.334
What happened to him?

00:04:14.413 --> 00:04:15.824
Life.

00:04:16.013 --> 00:04:18.493
I built him. I take care of him.

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:21.494
I'll fix him.

00:04:21.573 --> 00:04:22.620
Like a mechanic?

00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:24.178
Yeah.

00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:25.780
Hmm.

00:04:25.853 --> 00:04:28.618
If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...

00:04:28.693 --> 00:04:29.774
It's "Iron Patriot" now.

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.014
That's way cooler.

00:04:31.093 --> 00:04:32.424
No, it's not.

00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:36.583
Anyways, I would have added in,
um, the retro...

00:04:36.773 --> 00:04:39.219
- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:41.262
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?

00:04:41.413 --> 00:04:43.373
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

00:04:43.613 --> 00:04:44.774
- Not a good idea.
- Oops.

00:04:45.093 --> 00:04:47.221
What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:48.819
He's in pain.
He's been injured. Leave him alone.

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:49.934
Sorry.

00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:51.544
Are you?

00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:55.340
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.

00:04:55.413 --> 00:04:57.142
So, uh, who's home?

00:04:57.213 --> 00:05:01.582
Well, my mom already left for the diner
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:05.742
I guess he won,
because that was six years ago.

00:05:06.253 --> 00:05:07.334
Hmm.

00:05:07.653 --> 00:05:09.701
Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.

00:05:09.773 --> 00:05:10.774
Here's what I need.

00:05:11.813 --> 00:05:14.293
A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,

00:05:14.373 --> 00:05:16.819
the pneumatic actuator from
your bazooka over there,

00:05:16.893 --> 00:05:20.261
a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:22.501
What's in it for me?

00:05:22.573 --> 00:05:25.338
- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?

00:05:25.573 --> 00:05:28.816
The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?

00:05:28.893 --> 00:05:30.418
How'd you know that?

00:05:31.093 --> 00:05:32.743
I got just the thing.

00:05:35.093 --> 00:05:38.063
This is a piñata for a cricket.

00:05:38.133 --> 00:05:39.853
I'm kidding.
This is a very powerful weapon.

00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:43.176
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

00:05:43.253 --> 00:05:44.334
it discourages bullying.

00:05:45.253 --> 00:05:48.780
Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.
Deal?

00:05:49.093 --> 00:05:50.254
Deal? What do you say?

00:05:50.413 --> 00:05:52.177
- Deal.
- Deal?

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:54.654
What's your name?

00:05:55.093 --> 00:05:57.255
Harley. And you're...

00:05:57.453 --> 00:05:58.739
The mechanic.

00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:01.013
Tony.

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:04.974
You know what keeps
going through my head?

00:06:05.053 --> 00:06:06.657
"Where's my sandwich?"

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:13.174
First rule of going on the run
is don't run, walk.

00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:16.260
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

00:06:19.305 --> 00:06:21.724
The drive has a Level Six homing program,
so as soon as we boot up

00:06:21.933 --> 00:06:23.809
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

00:06:23.893 --> 00:06:24.936
How much time will we have?

00:06:25.394 --> 00:06:27.605
About nine minutes from

00:06:29.232 --> 00:06:30.274
now.

00:06:35.613 --> 00:06:37.240
Fury was right about that ship.

00:06:37.448 --> 00:06:39.534
Somebody's trying to hide something.

00:06:39.742 --> 00:06:41.702
This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.

00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:44.288
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

00:06:44.497 --> 00:06:46.123
Can you override it?

00:06:46.874 --> 00:06:48.834
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

00:06:49.502 --> 00:06:50.628
Slightly.

00:07:01.472 --> 00:07:02.682
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

00:07:03.808 --> 00:07:05.393
This is a program that
S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:06.978
to track hostile malware,

00:07:07.144 --> 00:07:09.939
so if we can't read the file,

00:07:10.147 --> 00:07:11.732
maybe we can find out
where it came from.

00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:13.317
Can I help you guys with anything?

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.697
No. My fiancé was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.

00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:19.824
Right. We're getting married.

00:07:20.032 --> 00:07:21.742
Congratulations.
Where are you guys thinking about going?

00:07:23.828 --> 00:07:25.329
New Jersey.

00:07:30.293 --> 00:07:31.919
I have the exact same glasses.

00:07:32.837 --> 00:07:34.505
Wow, you two are practically twins.

00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:36.173
Yeah, I wish.

00:07:36.674 --> 00:07:37.675
Specimen.

00:07:38.384 --> 00:07:40.428
If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.

00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:41.512
Thank you.

00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:46.350
- You said nine minutes. Come on.
- Relax.

00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:48.686
Got it.

00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:53.941
You know it?

00:07:54.025 --> 00:07:55.568
I used to. Let's go.

00:07:57.737 --> 00:07:58.946
Standard tac team.

00:07:59.155 --> 00:08:00.489
Two behind, two across,

00:08:00.698 --> 00:08:02.283
and two coming straight at us.

00:08:02.491 --> 00:08:05.202
If they make us, I'll engage,
you hit the south escalator to the metro.

00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:07.330
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.

00:08:07.538 --> 00:08:08.748
- What?
- Do it.

00:08:17.048 --> 00:08:18.049
Negative at the source.

00:08:18.215 --> 00:08:19.216
Give me a floor rundown.

00:08:19.717 --> 00:08:20.885
<i>Negative on three.</i>

00:08:21.302 --> 00:08:22.303
<i>Negative on two.</i>

00:08:22.637 --> 00:08:24.889
Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.

00:08:32.938 --> 00:08:33.898
- Kiss me.
- What?

00:08:34.106 --> 00:08:36.108
Public displays of affection make
people very uncomfortable.

00:08:36.317 --> 00:08:37.443
Yes, they do.

00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:48.496
You still uncomfortable?

00:08:49.413 --> 00:08:50.915
It's not exactly the word I would use.

00:09:00.049 --> 00:09:02.176
Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?

00:09:03.135 --> 00:09:04.679
Nazi Germany.

00:09:05.096 --> 00:09:07.139
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.

00:09:11.394 --> 00:09:14.939
All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.

00:09:15.147 --> 00:09:16.524
I feel like, if you don't answer it though,

00:09:16.607 --> 00:09:17.942
- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.653
Was that your first kiss since 1945?

00:09:21.153 --> 00:09:22.613
- That bad, huh?
- I didn't say that.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.365
Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.574
No, I didn't.

00:09:25.658 --> 00:09:27.576
I just wondered how much
practice you've had.

00:09:27.785 --> 00:09:29.412
- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.831
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

00:09:32.248 --> 00:09:33.958
I'm 95, I'm not dead.

00:09:34.542 --> 00:09:36.085
Nobody special, though?

00:09:38.295 --> 00:09:39.380
Believe it or not, it's kind of hard

00:09:39.463 --> 00:09:41.757
to find someone with shared
life experience.

00:09:41.841 --> 00:09:43.426
Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.

00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:45.803
- What, like you?
- I don't know.

00:09:46.011 --> 00:09:47.138
The truth is a matter of circumstance.

00:09:47.304 --> 00:09:49.640
It's not all things to all people,
all the time.

00:09:50.975 --> 00:09:51.976
Neither am I.

00:09:52.727 --> 00:09:53.978
That's a tough way to live.

00:09:55.187 --> 00:09:57.273
It's a good way not to die, though.

00:09:58.149 --> 00:09:59.608
You know, it's kind of hard
to trust someone,

00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:01.277
when you don't know
who that someone really is.

00:10:02.361 --> 00:10:03.446
Yeah.

00:10:06.657 --> 00:10:07.742
Who do you want me to be?

00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:09.702
How about a friend?

00:10:13.164 --> 00:10:17.251
Well, there's a chance you might be
in the wrong business, Rogers.

00:10:33.017 --> 00:10:34.393
This is it.

00:10:35.644 --> 00:10:37.563
The file came from these coordinates.

00:10:38.522 --> 00:10:39.774
So did I.

00:12:03.317 --> 00:12:06.320
Acting as caretakers to these
scoundrels is beneath us.

00:12:06.487 --> 00:12:10.783
Oh, please! If they were beneath you,
my rotund friend, they'd all be dead.

00:12:25.464 --> 00:12:27.466
- Keep in line!
- Move it!

00:12:28.967 --> 00:12:32.638
Odin continues
to bring me new friends.

00:12:33.013 --> 00:12:34.765
How thoughtful.

00:12:35.015 --> 00:12:38.477
The books I sent,
do they not interest you?

00:12:38.977 --> 00:12:42.272
Is that how I am to while away eternity?
Reading?

00:12:42.356 --> 00:12:45.484
I've done everything in my power
to make you comfortable, Loki.

00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:46.610
Have you?

00:12:47.653 --> 00:12:49.488
Does Odin share your concern?

00:12:50.948 --> 00:12:52.491
Does Thor?

00:12:52.658 --> 00:12:56.286
It must be so inconvenient,
them asking after me day and night.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.498
You know full well it was your actions
that brought you here.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.375
My actions?

00:13:01.542 --> 00:13:04.795
I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I had been fed my entire life...

00:13:04.878 --> 00:13:06.547
That I was born to be a king.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.590
A king?

00:13:08.674 --> 00:13:10.676
A true king admits his faults.

00:13:10.801 --> 00:13:12.219
What of the lives you took on Earth?

00:13:12.386 --> 00:13:13.971
A mere handful
compared to the number

00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:15.848
that Odin has taken himself.

00:13:16.014 --> 00:13:18.684
- Your father...
- He's not my father!

00:13:21.562 --> 00:13:23.772
Then am I not your mother?

00:13:28.986 --> 00:13:30.946
You're not.

00:13:34.741 --> 00:13:39.705
You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.

00:13:54.887 --> 00:13:58.056
When you came for me,
you knew I was in trouble.

00:13:58.182 --> 00:13:59.433
Heimdall had lost sight of you.

00:13:59.558 --> 00:14:01.226
You were no longer on Earth.

00:14:01.393 --> 00:14:02.686
How is that possible?

00:14:02.895 --> 00:14:04.855
I believe you were and you weren't.

00:14:04.938 --> 00:14:07.816
The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil

00:14:08.108 --> 00:14:11.361
orbiting Midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.

00:14:11.528 --> 00:14:15.657
And every 5,000 years,
the worlds align perfectly

00:14:15.741 --> 00:14:17.951
and we call this the Convergence.

00:14:20.078 --> 00:14:23.749
During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.

00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:27.211
It's possible you found
one of these points.

00:14:29.254 --> 00:14:31.465
We are lucky that it remained open.

00:14:31.632 --> 00:14:35.886
Once the worlds pass out of alignment

00:14:37.304 --> 00:14:39.348
then the connection is lost.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.488
I like the way you explain things.

00:14:56.782 --> 00:14:58.158
What's going to happen to me?

00:14:58.325 --> 00:14:59.910
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

00:15:00.077 --> 00:15:03.247
- Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.

00:15:03.455 --> 00:15:05.123
Don't let him hear you say that.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.793
Jane Foster...

00:15:07.876 --> 00:15:09.211
Please meet Frigga,

00:15:09.294 --> 00:15:11.213
Queen of Asgard, and my mother.

00:15:13.966 --> 00:15:15.425
Hi.

00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:24.251
This camp is where I was trained.

00:15:27.296 --> 00:15:28.422
Change much?

00:15:31.091 --> 00:15:32.301
A little.

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:34.636
Pick up the pace, ladies!

00:15:34.845 --> 00:15:36.430
Let's go! Let's go!

00:15:37.264 --> 00:15:38.515
Double time!

00:15:39.808 --> 00:15:41.810
Come on, Rogers, move it!

00:15:45.856 --> 00:15:47.149
Come on, fall in!

00:15:48.192 --> 00:15:49.276
Rogers!

00:15:49.735 --> 00:15:50.944
I said fall in!

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.448
This is a dead end.

00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:57.409
Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.

00:15:58.827 --> 00:16:01.663
Whoever wrote the file must have
used a router to throw people off.

00:16:03.624 --> 00:16:04.625
What is it?

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.627
Army regulations forbid storing munitions

00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:08.754
within 500 yards of the barracks.

00:16:09.546 --> 00:16:11.590
This building is in the wrong place.

00:16:27.133 --> 00:16:28.969
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:16:29.844 --> 00:16:31.763
Maybe where it started.

00:16:35.518 --> 00:16:37.645
<i>Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.</i>

00:16:38.146 --> 00:16:39.564
To any reasonable person,

00:16:39.647 --> 00:16:42.275
that would make him a martyr,
not a traitor.

00:16:42.358 --> 00:16:43.734
You know what makes him a traitor?

00:16:43.901 --> 00:16:46.237
Hiring a mercenary
to hijack his own ship.

00:16:46.404 --> 00:16:48.739
Nick Fury used your friendship

00:16:48.906 --> 00:16:51.951
to coerce this Council into
delaying Project Insight.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.412
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

00:16:54.787 --> 00:16:57.665
At best, he lied to you. At worst...

00:16:57.874 --> 00:17:00.168
Are you calling for my resignation?

00:17:00.376 --> 00:17:01.752
I've got a pen and paper right here.

00:17:01.961 --> 00:17:04.505
That discussion can be
tabled for a later time.

00:17:05.715 --> 00:17:07.258
But you do want to have a discussion?

00:17:07.425 --> 00:17:09.343
We've already had it, Mr. Secretary.

00:17:10.428 --> 00:17:14.807
This Council moves to immediately
reactivate Project Insight.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.437
If you want to say something snappy,
now would be a good time.

00:17:24.638 --> 00:17:26.718
The sandwich was fair,
the spring was a little rusty,

00:17:26.758 --> 00:17:29.204
the rest of the materials, I'll make do.

00:17:29.278 --> 00:17:31.007
By the way,
when you said your sister had a watch...

00:17:31.078 --> 00:17:32.159
- Yeah?
- ...I was kind of hoping

00:17:32.238 --> 00:17:34.559
for something a little more
adult than that.

00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:38.285
She's six.
Anyway, it's a limited edition.

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:39.803
When can we talk about New York?

00:17:39.878 --> 00:17:41.767
Maybe never.
Relax about it.

00:17:41.838 --> 00:17:43.363
What about the Avengers?
Can we talk about them?

00:17:43.478 --> 00:17:45.639
I dunno. Later.
Hey, kid, give me a little space.

00:17:49.718 --> 00:17:53.245
What's the official story here?
What happened?

00:17:53.318 --> 00:17:57.846
I guess this guy named
Chad Davis used to live roundabouts.

00:17:58.758 --> 00:18:01.364
He won a bunch of medals in the army.

00:18:01.438 --> 00:18:05.682
And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:08.446
Then he blew himself up, right here.

00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:16.527
- Six people died, right?
- Yeah.

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.367
- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:18:24.518 --> 00:18:27.920
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

00:18:29.158 --> 00:18:30.239
Think about it.

00:18:30.798 --> 00:18:32.926
Six dead. Only five shadows.

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:34.524
Yeah.

00:18:34.598 --> 00:18:37.442
People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.

00:18:39.158 --> 00:18:40.887
Except the bomb guy.

00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:44.849
He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.369
That's why there's only five.

00:18:46.518 --> 00:18:49.408
- Do you buy that?
- It's what everyone says.

00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:55.165
You know what
this crater reminds me of?

00:18:55.238 --> 00:18:57.718
No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.

00:18:58.318 --> 00:19:03.404
That giant Wormhole in,
um, in New York.

00:19:03.878 --> 00:19:05.926
Does it remind you?

00:19:05.998 --> 00:19:08.046
That's manipulative.
I don't want to talk about it.

00:19:08.118 --> 00:19:10.086
Are they coming back? The aliens?

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:11.484
Maybe. Can you stop?

00:19:13.198 --> 00:19:15.360
Remember what I told you,
that I have an anxiety issue?

00:19:15.438 --> 00:19:17.247
Does this subject make you edgy?

00:19:17.318 --> 00:19:19.559
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch
my breath for a second?

00:19:19.638 --> 00:19:21.481
Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?

00:19:21.558 --> 00:19:23.959
Do you need a plastic bag
to breathe into?

00:19:24.238 --> 00:19:25.842
- Do you have medication?
- No.

00:19:26.038 --> 00:19:27.369
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

00:19:27.518 --> 00:19:28.929
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

00:19:28.998 --> 00:19:30.488
Are you going completely mental?

00:19:31.198 --> 00:19:32.848
I can stop. Do you want me to stop?

00:19:33.598 --> 00:19:34.838
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

00:19:34.918 --> 00:19:37.444
I swear that you're gonna freak me out.

00:19:39.798 --> 00:19:41.880
Ah, man, you did it,
didn't you? You happy now?

00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.005
What did I say?

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:44.838
Hey! Wait up!

00:19:45.638 --> 00:19:47.402
Wait, wait.

00:19:52.518 --> 00:19:54.361
What the hell was that?

00:19:58.278 --> 00:20:00.519
Your fault.
You spazzed me out.

00:20:02.198 --> 00:20:04.565
- Okay, back to business.
- Where were we?

00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:05.844
The guy who died.

00:20:06.158 --> 00:20:09.082
Relatives? Mom?
Mrs Davis, where is she?

00:20:09.158 --> 00:20:10.205
Where she always is.

00:20:11.038 --> 00:20:12.927
See? Now, you're being helpful.

00:21:02.682 --> 00:21:04.100
Move!

00:21:50.188 --> 00:21:51.439
To the dungeons!

00:21:52.315 --> 00:21:53.316
Come on!

00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:19.050
You might want to take
the stairs to the left.

00:22:30.103 --> 00:22:31.438
The prisons.

00:22:31.604 --> 00:22:33.398
- Loki...
- Go.

00:22:33.565 --> 00:22:35.400
I will look after her.

00:22:46.828 --> 00:22:48.371
It's as if they resent
being imprisoned!

00:22:52.417 --> 00:22:54.502
There's no pleasing some creatures.

00:23:03.261 --> 00:23:05.388
Return to your cells,
no further harm will come to you.

00:23:05.597 --> 00:23:06.765
You have my word.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.935
Very well, you do not have my word.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.822
Send a squadron to the weapons vault.

00:23:22.947 --> 00:23:25.492
Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.

00:23:25.658 --> 00:23:27.243
- Odin.
- Frigga.

00:23:28.119 --> 00:23:29.120
Go!

00:23:29.913 --> 00:23:31.164
It's a skirmish.

00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:32.603
You take care.

00:23:32.686 --> 00:23:33.687
Despite all I have survived,

00:23:34.605 --> 00:23:37.316
my queen still worries over me.

00:23:37.524 --> 00:23:38.850
It's only because I worry over you

00:23:38.976 --> 00:23:40.811
that you have survived.

00:23:43.113 --> 00:23:44.323
Listen to me now.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.451
I need you to do everything I ask,
no questions.

00:23:47.576 --> 00:23:48.744
Yes, ma'am.

00:26:32.562 --> 00:26:34.272
And there's Stark's father.

00:26:34.897 --> 00:26:36.232
Howard.

00:26:37.567 --> 00:26:38.818
Who's the girl?

00:26:58.212 --> 00:27:00.548
If you're already working
in a secret office,

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.685
why do you need to hide the elevator?

00:28:04.404 --> 00:28:08.157
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.

00:28:38.146 --> 00:28:40.148
Y-E-S spells yes.

00:28:44.193 --> 00:28:46.112
Shall we play a game?

00:28:46.737 --> 00:28:49.115
- It's from a movie that was really...
- I know, I saw it.

00:28:55.371 --> 00:28:57.331
<i>Rogers, Steven,</i>

00:28:58.374 --> 00:29:00.042
<i>born 1918.</i>

00:29:03.212 --> 00:29:05.923
<i>Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,</i>

00:29:06.132 --> 00:29:07.967
<i>born 1984.</i>

00:29:08.176 --> 00:29:09.510
It's some kind of recording.

00:29:09.719 --> 00:29:12.054
<i>I am not a recording,</i> Fräulein.

00:29:12.722 --> 00:29:14.432
<i>I may not be the man I was</i>

00:29:14.724 --> 00:29:17.894
<i>when the Captain took me
prisoner in 1945.</i>

00:29:18.394 --> 00:29:20.021
<i>But I am.</i>

00:29:21.856 --> 00:29:23.274
You know this thing?

00:29:26.694 --> 00:29:29.697
Arnim Zola was a German scientist
who worked for the Red Skull.

00:29:30.072 --> 00:29:31.115
He's been dead for years.

00:29:31.324 --> 00:29:33.618
<i>First correction, I am Swiss.</i>

00:29:34.035 --> 00:29:36.412
<i>Second, look around you.</i>

00:29:36.579 --> 00:29:39.207
<i>I have never been more alive.</i>

00:29:39.749 --> 00:29:44.045
<i>In 1972, I received a terminal diagnosis.</i>

00:29:44.253 --> 00:29:47.006
<i>Science could not save my body.</i>

00:29:47.298 --> 00:29:51.427
<i>My mind, however, that was worth saving,</i>

00:29:51.636 --> 00:29:55.389
<i>on 200, 000 feet of databanks.</i>

00:29:55.598 --> 00:29:59.185
<i>You are standing in my brain.</i>

00:29:59.393 --> 00:30:01.604
- How did you get here?
<i>- Invited.</i>

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.440
It was Operation Paperclip
after World War II.

00:30:04.649 --> 00:30:08.277
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited German
scientists with strategic value.

00:30:08.444 --> 00:30:10.613
<i>They thought I could help their cause.</i>

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.657
<i>I also helped my own.</i>

00:30:12.865 --> 00:30:14.367
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.

00:30:14.575 --> 00:30:18.454
<i>Cut off one head,
two more shall take its place.</i>

00:30:18.871 --> 00:30:20.289
Prove it.

00:30:21.666 --> 00:30:23.584
<i>Accessing archive.</i>

00:30:24.126 --> 00:30:27.463
<i>HYDRA was founded
on the belief that humanity</i>

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.800
<i>could not be trusted
with its own freedom.</i>

00:30:31.008 --> 00:30:33.678
<i>What we did not realize
was that if you try</i>

00:30:33.886 --> 00:30:36.681
<i>to take that freedom, they resist.</i>

00:30:37.557 --> 00:30:39.100
<i>The war taught us much.</i>

00:30:39.684 --> 00:30:42.979
<i>Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.</i>

00:30:44.146 --> 00:30:46.857
<i>After the war, S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded,</i>

00:30:47.066 --> 00:30:49.151
<i>and I was recruited.</i>

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:51.612
<i>The new HYDRA grew.</i>

00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:56.075
<i>A beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

00:30:56.492 --> 00:30:58.160
<i>For 70 years,</i>

00:30:58.327 --> 00:31:03.958
<i>HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,</i>

00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:06.836
<i>and when history did not cooperate,</i>

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.338
<i>history was changed.</i>

00:31:09.672 --> 00:31:11.841
That's impossible.
S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you.

00:31:11.966 --> 00:31:14.343
<i>Accidents will happen.</i>

00:31:16.387 --> 00:31:19.181
<i>HYDRA created a world so chaotic</i>

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.227
<i>that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom</i>

00:31:23.561 --> 00:31:25.563
<i>to gain its security.</i>

00:31:26.355 --> 00:31:29.609
<i>Once a purification process is complete,</i>

00:31:30.151 --> 00:31:33.529
<i>HYDRA's new world order will arise.</i>

00:31:34.447 --> 00:31:36.365
<i>We won, Captain.</i>

00:31:36.532 --> 00:31:40.036
<i>Your death amounts
to the same as your life.</i>

00:31:40.536 --> 00:31:41.579
<i>A zero sum.</i>

00:31:45.207 --> 00:31:47.084
<i>As I was saying...</i>

00:31:47.918 --> 00:31:48.961
What's on this drive?

00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:52.465
<i>Project Insight requires insight.</i>

00:31:52.923 --> 00:31:55.468
<i>So, I wrote an algorithm.</i>

00:31:55.843 --> 00:31:57.136
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?

00:31:57.219 --> 00:31:59.722
<i>The answer to your
question is fascinating.</i>

00:32:00.181 --> 00:32:04.226
<i>Unfortunately, you shall be
too dead to hear it.</i>

00:32:10.066 --> 00:32:11.484
Steve, we got a bogey.

00:32:11.942 --> 00:32:13.486
Short range ballistic.

00:32:13.819 --> 00:32:15.488
- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?

00:32:15.571 --> 00:32:16.572
S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:32:16.739 --> 00:32:20.493
<i>I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain.</i>

00:32:20.993 --> 00:32:22.078
<i>Admit it.</i>

00:32:22.244 --> 00:32:24.497
<i>It's better this way.</i>

00:32:24.705 --> 00:32:26.082
<i>We are, both of us,</i>

00:32:27.416 --> 00:32:28.668
<i>out of time.</i>

00:32:52.684 --> 00:32:53.645
Uh...

00:32:53.724 --> 00:32:54.764
Sorry.

00:32:54.834 --> 00:32:56.324
Lady?

00:32:57.274 --> 00:32:59.242
Is this, uh...

00:33:00.274 --> 00:33:01.275
Thank you.

00:33:03.834 --> 00:33:06.405
Nice haircut. It suits you.

00:33:06.954 --> 00:33:07.955
Nice watch.

00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:09.639
Yeah. A limited edition.

00:33:10.194 --> 00:33:12.242
Oh, I don't doubt it.

00:33:13.274 --> 00:33:14.514
Well, have a good evening.

00:33:27.154 --> 00:33:28.280
Excuse me.

00:33:37.914 --> 00:33:39.598
Mrs Davis?

00:33:40.354 --> 00:33:41.355
Mind if I join you?

00:33:42.234 --> 00:33:43.235
Free country.

00:33:43.714 --> 00:33:45.204
Sure is.

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:51.319
All right.

00:33:52.274 --> 00:33:54.276
Where would you like to start?

00:33:54.634 --> 00:33:57.843
I just want to say,
I'm sorry about your loss.

00:33:57.914 --> 00:33:59.434
I want to know
what you think happened.

00:34:01.554 --> 00:34:06.481
Look, I brought your damn file.
You take it, go.

00:34:07.474 --> 00:34:11.240
Whatever was in here,
he wanted no part of it.

00:34:12.354 --> 00:34:15.198
Clearly, you're waiting
for someone else. Huh?

00:34:15.314 --> 00:34:16.514
Supposed to meet someone here?

00:34:16.594 --> 00:34:17.595
Yeah.

00:34:31.474 --> 00:34:33.875
Mrs Davis,
your son didn't kill himself.

00:34:33.954 --> 00:34:35.843
I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.

00:34:37.514 --> 00:34:38.675
Someone used him.

00:34:39.994 --> 00:34:40.995
What?

00:34:41.674 --> 00:34:43.597
As a weapon.

00:34:47.354 --> 00:34:51.075
You're not the person
that called me after all, are you?

00:34:51.794 --> 00:34:53.155
Actually, I am.

00:34:56.234 --> 00:34:57.634
Hey, hey, hey!

00:34:57.674 --> 00:35:00.359
What's all this about?
What the hell is going on here?

00:35:00.794 --> 00:35:02.444
It's called an arrest.

00:35:03.154 --> 00:35:04.565
Sheriff, is it?

00:35:04.674 --> 00:35:06.517
Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?

00:35:06.594 --> 00:35:08.642
Homeland Security. We good here?

00:35:08.714 --> 00:35:10.557
No, we're not "good."

00:35:10.634 --> 00:35:12.314
I need a little more information
than that.

00:35:12.434 --> 00:35:14.715
Well, I think it's a little above
your pay grade, Sheriff.

00:35:14.914 --> 00:35:16.040
Yeah?
Well, why don't you

00:35:16.194 --> 00:35:18.162
get on the horn
to Nashville and, uh, upgrade me?

00:35:18.434 --> 00:35:22.041
All right. You know what?
I was hoping to do this the smart way,

00:35:22.634 --> 00:35:24.074
but, uh, the fun way is always good.

00:35:25.274 --> 00:35:26.764
Deputy, get this woman out of...

00:35:40.314 --> 00:35:42.874
Hey, hot wings, you want to party?
Come on, you and me, let's go.

00:35:56.594 --> 00:35:58.562
- Crazy, huh?
- Yep.

00:36:00.074 --> 00:36:01.121
Watch this.

00:37:07.314 --> 00:37:10.079
You walked right into this one.
I've dated hotter chicks than you.

00:37:12.474 --> 00:37:13.475
That's all you got?

00:37:14.994 --> 00:37:16.405
A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

00:37:16.474 --> 00:37:19.876
Sweetheart, that could be
the name of my autobiography.

00:38:20.554 --> 00:38:22.682
- Let me go!
- Help me!

00:38:26.914 --> 00:38:28.075
Anyway.

00:38:29.194 --> 00:38:31.322
Hey, kid,
what would you like for Christmas?

00:38:31.394 --> 00:38:33.362
Mr Stark, I am so sorry.

00:38:33.434 --> 00:38:34.640
No, no, no.
I think he was trying to say,

00:38:34.714 --> 00:38:36.637
"I want my goddamn file."

00:38:37.074 --> 00:38:38.121
It's not your fault, kid.

00:38:41.074 --> 00:38:42.599
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

00:38:49.154 --> 00:38:50.394
You like that, Westworld?

00:38:50.794 --> 00:38:52.155
That's the thing about smart guys,

00:38:52.914 --> 00:38:54.723
we always cover our ass.

00:39:07.794 --> 00:39:08.875
Ah!

00:41:55.451 --> 00:41:58.579
The throne of Asgard is destroyed!
To the king!

00:42:14.387 --> 00:42:15.388
Frigga.

00:42:24.188 --> 00:42:26.607
Stand down, creature,

00:42:26.774 --> 00:42:28.401
and you may still survive this.

00:42:28.484 --> 00:42:30.570
I have survived worse, woman.

00:42:32.029 --> 00:42:33.406
Who are you?

00:42:33.948 --> 00:42:35.992
I am Malekith.

00:42:36.158 --> 00:42:38.786
And I would have what is mine.

00:43:09.442 --> 00:43:11.611
You have taken something, child.

00:43:12.653 --> 00:43:13.696
Give it back.

00:43:28.085 --> 00:43:29.170
Witch!

00:43:32.882 --> 00:43:34.383
Where is the Aether?

00:43:34.508 --> 00:43:36.802
I'll never tell you.

00:43:37.803 --> 00:43:39.013
I believe you.

00:43:41.515 --> 00:43:43.684
No!

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:10.868
You're welcome.

00:47:12.179 --> 00:47:13.510
For what? Did I miss something?

00:47:13.579 --> 00:47:15.547
Me, saving your life.

00:47:15.619 --> 00:47:18.782
Yeah. A, I saved you first.
B, thanks. Sort of.

00:47:18.859 --> 00:47:21.624
And C, if you do someone a solid,
don't be a yutz.

00:47:21.699 --> 00:47:24.987
All right? Just play it cool.
Otherwise you come off grandiose.

00:47:25.059 --> 00:47:26.868
Unlike you?

00:47:28.459 --> 00:47:30.348
Admit it, you need me.

00:47:30.659 --> 00:47:31.945
We're connected.

00:47:32.139 --> 00:47:34.179
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

00:47:34.299 --> 00:47:36.586
keep your trap shut, guard the suit,

00:47:36.659 --> 00:47:37.899
and stay connected to the telephone

00:47:37.979 --> 00:47:39.708
because if I call,
you better pick up. Okay?

00:47:40.299 --> 00:47:42.905
Can you feel that? We're done here.

00:47:42.979 --> 00:47:44.265
Move out of the way,
or I'm gonna run you over.

00:47:44.659 --> 00:47:46.070
Bye, kid.

00:47:52.619 --> 00:47:54.144
I'm sorry, kid.

00:47:54.859 --> 00:47:55.860
You did good.

00:47:56.339 --> 00:47:58.819
So, now you're just gonna
leave me here, like my dad?

00:48:00.939 --> 00:48:01.940
Yeah.

00:48:03.459 --> 00:48:04.790
Wait, you're guilt-tripping me,
aren't you?

00:48:05.019 --> 00:48:06.509
I'm cold.

00:48:06.779 --> 00:48:09.020
I can tell.
You know how I can tell?

00:48:10.499 --> 00:48:12.024
Because we're connected.

00:48:15.779 --> 00:48:17.941
It was worth a shot.

00:48:32.721 --> 00:48:34.361
Why were you
at the house tonight?

00:48:35.481 --> 00:48:37.643
What was so important
that you had to speak to Tony?

00:48:41.481 --> 00:48:44.451
I think that my boss
is working for the Mandarin.

00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:47.212
So, if you still want to talk about it

00:48:47.281 --> 00:48:50.364
I suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe.

00:48:51.641 --> 00:48:54.531
Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?

00:48:54.721 --> 00:48:56.849
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...

00:48:56.921 --> 00:48:59.652
That figures. What I actually am
is a biological DNA coder

00:48:59.761 --> 00:49:02.082
running a team of 40
out of a privately funded think tank.

00:49:02.161 --> 00:49:03.890
But sure, you can call me a botanist.

00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:08.289
This boss of yours,
does he have a name?

00:49:08.801 --> 00:49:11.122
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

00:49:14.401 --> 00:49:16.722
<i>Well, we took the house down,
sir. But there's no sign of a body.</i>

00:49:16.801 --> 00:49:17.922
- Mmm-hmm. I see.
<i>- No Stark.</i>

00:49:18.321 --> 00:49:20.562
I have to go.

00:49:20.641 --> 00:49:22.882
The master is about to record
and he's a little...

00:49:23.801 --> 00:49:25.565
Well, you know how he gets.

00:49:25.641 --> 00:49:29.168
Keep your appointment tonight
and call me when it's done.

00:49:34.521 --> 00:49:36.762
All right, everybody.
No talking and no eye contact.

00:49:36.881 --> 00:49:39.168
Unless you want to get shot in the face.

00:49:50.881 --> 00:49:51.882
Report in.

00:49:53.921 --> 00:49:54.922
Path is clear.

00:49:59.961 --> 00:50:01.406
The master is travelling.

00:50:16.161 --> 00:50:19.290
Well, then, what are we waiting for?

00:51:19.466 --> 00:51:21.009
Call in the asset.

00:51:37.234 --> 00:51:38.610
I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce.

00:51:39.153 --> 00:51:40.946
You need anything before I leave?

00:51:41.738 --> 00:51:45.033
No... It's fine, Renata, you can go home.

00:51:45.659 --> 00:51:47.369
Okay. Night-night.

00:51:47.578 --> 00:51:49.246
Good night.

00:51:54.376 --> 00:51:55.752
Want some milk?

00:52:05.387 --> 00:52:07.222
The timetable has moved.

00:52:09.391 --> 00:52:11.101
Our window is limited.

00:52:15.147 --> 00:52:17.274
Two targets, Level Six.

00:52:18.734 --> 00:52:20.944
They already cost me Zola.

00:52:21.153 --> 00:52:23.363
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

00:52:25.324 --> 00:52:27.451
Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...

00:52:27.951 --> 00:52:29.244
I forgot my

00:52:29.453 --> 00:52:30.579
phone.

00:52:35.626 --> 00:52:38.754
Renata, I wish you would have knocked.
