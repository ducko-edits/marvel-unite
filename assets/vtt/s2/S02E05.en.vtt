WEBVTT

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:13.454
<i>Bucky?</i>

00:00:14.038 --> 00:00:15.456
Who the hell is Bucky?

00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:45.652
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:47.279
Get on your knees!

00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:50.074
Get down, get down!
Get on your knees!

00:00:50.157 --> 00:00:51.283
Down!

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:52.826
Don't move.

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:01.085
Put the gun down.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:03.212
Not here. Not here!

00:01:18.727 --> 00:01:19.770
<i>It was him.</i>

00:01:23.023 --> 00:01:26.527
He looked right at me like
he didn't even know me.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.780
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.

00:01:29.988 --> 00:01:31.198
Zola.

00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:32.991
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.035
Zola experimented on him.

00:01:35.244 --> 00:01:37.538
Whatever he did helped
Bucky survive the fall.

00:01:39.248 --> 00:01:40.541
They must have found him and...

00:01:40.624 --> 00:01:42.543
None of that's your fault, Steve.

00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:47.881
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

00:01:51.218 --> 00:01:52.928
We need to get a doctor here.

00:01:53.137 --> 00:01:54.138
If we don't put pressure on that wound,

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:55.639
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:06.358
That thing was squeezing my brain.

00:02:09.444 --> 00:02:10.529
Who is this guy?

00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:23.292
Three holes. Start digging.

00:02:50.444 --> 00:02:52.362
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:53.780
Maybe two.

00:02:53.947 --> 00:02:55.949
- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.

00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:08.086
About damn time.

00:03:47.624 --> 00:03:48.785
Ah...

00:03:50.824 --> 00:03:51.905
Okay.

00:04:00.864 --> 00:04:02.514
It's just like old times, huh?

00:04:02.864 --> 00:04:05.595
Oh, yeah. With zip ties.
It's a ball.

00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:07.314
It wasn't my idea.

00:04:07.384 --> 00:04:09.386
Okay. So you took Killian's card.

00:04:09.544 --> 00:04:10.545
I took his money.

00:04:10.824 --> 00:04:13.031
And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.

00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:14.913
- No.
- Yeah.

00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:16.674
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.

00:04:17.304 --> 00:04:18.590
Yeah?

00:04:22.464 --> 00:04:23.989
A lot has happened, Tony.

00:04:24.944 --> 00:04:26.389
But I'm close.

00:04:27.064 --> 00:04:29.192
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.

00:04:29.264 --> 00:04:31.426
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:32.949
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.

00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:34.355
Maya, you're kidding yourself.

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:35.710
Then help me fix it.

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:42.395
Did I do that?

00:04:43.704 --> 00:04:44.705
Yes.

00:04:45.024 --> 00:04:46.544
I remember the night, not the morning.

00:04:47.424 --> 00:04:48.710
Is this what
you've been chasing around?

00:04:48.784 --> 00:04:50.866
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.

00:04:51.864 --> 00:04:55.471
You used to have a moral psychology.

00:04:55.544 --> 00:04:57.706
You used to have ideals.

00:04:58.144 --> 00:05:00.465
You wanted to help people.

00:05:00.544 --> 00:05:02.433
Now look at you.

00:05:03.464 --> 00:05:05.432
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who

00:05:08.744 --> 00:05:10.269
still has their soul.

00:05:15.944 --> 00:05:16.945
Get me out of here.

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:21.434
Come on.

00:05:22.584 --> 00:05:24.624
You know what my old man
used to say to me?

00:05:25.304 --> 00:05:28.387
One of his favourite of many sayings...

00:05:28.464 --> 00:05:32.833
"The early bird gets the worm, but
the second mouse gets the cheese."

00:05:33.024 --> 00:05:35.186
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?

00:05:35.264 --> 00:05:37.665
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?

00:05:37.744 --> 00:05:39.746
I'm here to thank you.

00:05:39.944 --> 00:05:42.264
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.

00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:44.389
Desperation.

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:46.594
If you think back to Switzerland,

00:05:46.704 --> 00:05:49.708
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?

00:05:49.784 --> 00:05:52.674
Well, for the first 20 minutes,

00:05:53.104 --> 00:05:55.072
I actually thought you'd show up.

00:05:55.144 --> 00:05:56.953
And the next hour...

00:05:58.544 --> 00:06:02.947
I considered taking that
one-step shortcut to the lobby.

00:06:03.224 --> 00:06:04.225
If you know what I mean.

00:06:04.624 --> 00:06:07.628
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

00:06:08.104 --> 00:06:10.391
But as I looked out over that city,

00:06:10.624 --> 00:06:13.309
<i>nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,</i>

00:06:13.384 --> 00:06:15.625
<i>no one was even looking.</i>

00:06:15.704 --> 00:06:19.709
<i>I had a thought that would
guide me for years to come.</i>

00:06:20.304 --> 00:06:21.510
Anonymity, Tony.

00:06:23.184 --> 00:06:24.985
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.

00:06:25.064 --> 00:06:26.145
Right?

00:06:26.224 --> 00:06:28.625
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:31.184
<i>Because the second
you give evil a face,</i>

00:06:31.384 --> 00:06:34.228
<i>a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,</i>

00:06:34.304 --> 00:06:35.908
you hand the people a target.

00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:37.674
You're something else.

00:06:39.904 --> 00:06:40.985
You have met him, I assume?

00:06:41.064 --> 00:06:42.668
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.

00:06:42.744 --> 00:06:45.065
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.

00:06:45.144 --> 00:06:46.873
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...

00:06:46.944 --> 00:06:47.991
He's a stage actor.

00:06:48.984 --> 00:06:52.067
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.

00:06:52.144 --> 00:06:54.226
Anyway, the point is,

00:06:54.304 --> 00:06:57.626
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,

00:06:57.704 --> 00:06:59.025
subtlety has kind of had its day.

00:06:59.664 --> 00:07:01.268
What's next for you in your world?

00:07:01.344 --> 00:07:04.075
Well, I wanted to repay you
the selfsame gift

00:07:04.144 --> 00:07:06.465
that you so graciously imparted to me.

00:07:13.264 --> 00:07:14.265
Desperation.

00:07:15.224 --> 00:07:16.271
Now, this is live.

00:07:16.544 --> 00:07:19.593
I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment

00:07:19.664 --> 00:07:22.952
the body is trying to decide
whether to accept EXTREMIS

00:07:23.024 --> 00:07:24.105
or just give up.

00:07:24.304 --> 00:07:26.033
And if it gives up,

00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:31.034
I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:35.431
But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:40.148
We haven't even talked salary yet.

00:07:40.384 --> 00:07:42.705
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

00:07:43.584 --> 00:07:44.585
Let him go.

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:46.911
Hold on, hold on.

00:07:47.864 --> 00:07:48.911
Maya...

00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:50.947
I said, let him go.

00:07:51.664 --> 00:07:53.109
What are you doing?

00:07:53.184 --> 00:07:55.915
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.

00:07:56.784 --> 00:08:00.994
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.395
Maya, give me the injector.

00:08:02.464 --> 00:08:04.944
If I die, Killian,

00:08:05.024 --> 00:08:08.107
what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

00:08:08.184 --> 00:08:09.424
We're not doing this, okay?

00:08:09.624 --> 00:08:11.664
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?

00:08:24.744 --> 00:08:25.791
The good news is,

00:08:27.144 --> 00:08:29.385
a high-level position
has just been vacated.

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.070
You are a maniac.

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:42.306
No, I'm a visionary.

00:08:42.664 --> 00:08:44.871
But I do own a maniac.

00:08:44.944 --> 00:08:47.914
And he takes the stage tonight.

00:08:51.624 --> 00:08:52.705
Once we get the Patriot installed,

00:08:52.784 --> 00:08:55.754
it will take me
nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.

00:08:55.824 --> 00:08:57.235
Well, that's great,
but the last time I looked

00:08:57.304 --> 00:08:58.544
there was somebody
inside of it.

00:09:04.664 --> 00:09:05.904
Afternoon, gentlemen.

00:09:09.584 --> 00:09:11.109
Hello, Colonel.

00:09:12.064 --> 00:09:13.429
Step aside.

00:09:20.424 --> 00:09:21.789
Oh!

00:09:21.864 --> 00:09:23.628
We'll get you out of there.

00:09:23.704 --> 00:09:24.830
Don't worry.

00:09:25.544 --> 00:09:27.273
You'll damage the armour.

00:09:27.504 --> 00:09:28.915
Yes, I will.

00:09:29.504 --> 00:09:30.665
But you can fix it, right?

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:34.232
I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.

00:09:34.344 --> 00:09:35.834
And I want Potts with me.

00:09:35.904 --> 00:09:36.905
She's still in Phase Two.

00:09:38.944 --> 00:09:40.184
You're not going deaf, are you?

00:09:45.982 --> 00:09:47.608
Lacerated spinal column,

00:09:48.234 --> 00:09:49.569
cracked sternum,

00:09:49.652 --> 00:09:51.237
shattered collarbone,

00:09:51.404 --> 00:09:53.072
perforated liver,

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:54.991
and one hell of a headache.

00:09:55.241 --> 00:09:56.576
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

00:09:56.784 --> 00:09:58.077
Let's not forget that.

00:09:58.286 --> 00:09:59.912
Otherwise, I'm good.

00:10:00.288 --> 00:10:02.415
They cut you open. Your heart stopped.

00:10:02.623 --> 00:10:04.667
Tetrodotoxin B.

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:06.836
Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

00:10:07.044 --> 00:10:08.838
Banner developed it for stress.

00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:11.632
Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.

00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:13.718
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

00:10:13.926 --> 00:10:16.179
Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:18.890
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:20.308
Besides,

00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:23.102
I wasn't sure who to trust.

00:10:38.618 --> 00:10:39.952
Sergeant Barnes.

00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:43.122
Bucky, no!

00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:49.921
<i>The procedure has already started.</i>

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:57.470
<i>You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.</i>

00:10:57.887 --> 00:10:58.888
<i>Put him on ice.</i>

00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:11.275
Sir.

00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:13.486
He's unstable.

00:11:13.986 --> 00:11:15.404
Erratic.

00:11:28.668 --> 00:11:29.752
Mission report.

00:11:33.256 --> 00:11:34.590
Mission report now.

00:11:47.395 --> 00:11:48.813
The man on the bridge.

00:11:51.941 --> 00:11:53.192
Who was he?

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.862
You met him earlier this week
on another assignment.

00:11:59.949 --> 00:12:01.284
I knew him.

00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:12.545
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:16.215
You shaped the century.

00:12:16.924 --> 00:12:19.385
And I need you to do it one more time.

00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:24.348
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

00:12:24.557 --> 00:12:27.226
And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.

00:12:28.352 --> 00:12:31.564
But, if you don't do your part,
I can't do mine.

00:12:33.232 --> 00:12:36.068
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

00:12:39.113 --> 00:12:40.698
But I knew him.

00:12:47.246 --> 00:12:48.748
Prep him.

00:12:48.956 --> 00:12:51.542
He's been out of cryo freeze too long.

00:12:51.751 --> 00:12:53.753
Then wipe him and start over.

00:13:45.722 --> 00:13:49.267
What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.

00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:52.062
It would consume you.

00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:54.606
She's holding up all right.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.566
For now.

00:13:57.109 --> 00:13:59.653
She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.

00:13:59.778 --> 00:14:01.113
Say goodbye.

00:14:01.196 --> 00:14:02.989
Not this day.

00:14:03.115 --> 00:14:05.909
This day, the next,
a hundred years, it's nothing.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.704
It's a heartbeat.

00:14:09.121 --> 00:14:11.123
You'll never be ready.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.041
The only woman
whose love you've prized

00:14:13.125 --> 00:14:14.918
will be snatched from you.

00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:16.294
And will that satisfy you?

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.963
Satisfaction is not in my nature.

00:14:18.046 --> 00:14:20.257
Surrender is not in mine.

00:14:21.049 --> 00:14:22.551
- The son of Odin...
- No.

00:14:22.634 --> 00:14:24.678
Not just of Odin.

00:14:24.803 --> 00:14:27.139
You think you alone
were loved of Mother?

00:14:27.305 --> 00:14:29.307
You had her tricks,
but I had her trust.

00:14:29.433 --> 00:14:30.726
Trust?

00:14:31.643 --> 00:14:33.145
Was that her last expression?

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.981
Trust? When you let her die?

00:14:36.106 --> 00:14:38.817
- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.318
Who put me there?

00:14:40.444 --> 00:14:41.445
You know damn well!

00:14:42.154 --> 00:14:43.905
You know damn well who!

00:14:50.162 --> 00:14:52.831
She wouldn't want us to fight.

00:14:53.957 --> 00:14:56.501
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.

00:15:01.214 --> 00:15:03.717
I wish I could trust you.

00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:20.192
Trust my rage.

00:15:20.318 --> 00:15:23.113
Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,

00:15:23.238 --> 00:15:25.156
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.

00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:27.117
- What's S.H.I.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.119
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

00:15:29.244 --> 00:15:32.038
Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,

00:15:32.288 --> 00:15:35.750
and I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to do.

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:37.752
<i>Something else
went missing this week</i>

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:40.964
<i>when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

00:15:41.089 --> 00:15:44.634
<i>notable for his involvement
in the alien invasion of New York</i>

00:15:44.801 --> 00:15:46.094
<i>streaked nude across...</i>

00:15:46.261 --> 00:15:48.805
Darcy, you really need to look at this.

00:15:48.972 --> 00:15:50.140
Your friend, Erik...

00:15:50.223 --> 00:15:51.975
What was his last name again?

00:15:52.934 --> 00:15:56.312
<i>And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.</i>

00:15:56.479 --> 00:15:58.523
<i>He was later taken
into police custody</i>

00:15:59.149 --> 00:16:01.443
<i>for psychiatric evaluation.</i>

00:16:01.609 --> 00:16:03.653
<i>Police are still refusing to confirm...</i>

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:13.974
This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:17.978
He said peace wasn't an achievement,

00:16:18.437 --> 00:16:20.522
it was a responsibility.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:24.776
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:26.778
We have to stop the launch.

00:16:27.738 --> 00:16:30.490
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls anymore.

00:16:32.993 --> 00:16:34.077
What's that?

00:16:34.453 --> 00:16:37.122
Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet,

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:40.542
they'll triangulate with Insight satellites,
becoming fully weaponized.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.919
We need to breach those carriers

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:45.672
and replace their targeting
blades with our own.

00:16:45.756 --> 00:16:46.757
One or two won't cut it.

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:49.468
We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:53.013
because if even one of those
ships remains operational,

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:55.015
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:58.393
We have to assume everyone
aboard those carriers is HYDRA.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.812
We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:04.107
And maybe, just maybe
we can salvage what's left...

00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:05.317
We're not salvaging anything.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:06.777
We're not just taking down
the carriers, Nick.

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:08.028
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:09.404
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this.

00:17:09.613 --> 00:17:11.782
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.

00:17:11.907 --> 00:17:13.950
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:15.952
HYDRA grew right under your
nose and nobody noticed.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.289
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

00:17:19.623 --> 00:17:21.333
How many paid the price before you did?

00:17:24.378 --> 00:17:26.129
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:27.714
Even if you had, would you have told me?

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:31.134
Or would you have
compartmentalized that, too?

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:34.137
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:35.639
it all goes.

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.349
He's right.

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:44.189
Don't look at me.

00:17:44.398 --> 00:17:46.274
I do what he does, just slower.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.655
Well...

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:00.330
It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

00:18:11.967 --> 00:18:13.427
<i>We looked for you, after.</i>

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.721
<i>My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.</i>

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.517
I know, I'm sorry.
I just kind of wanted to be alone.

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:23.019
How was it?

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.980
It was okay.

00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:27.357
She's next to Dad.

00:18:28.859 --> 00:18:30.110
I was gonna ask...

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:31.987
I know what you're gonna
say, Buck. I just...

00:18:33.155 --> 00:18:34.656
We can put the couch
cushions on the floor

00:18:34.865 --> 00:18:36.366
like when we were kids.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.536
It'll be fun.
All you got to do is shine my shoes,

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.621
maybe take out the trash.

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.086
Come on.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:54.551
Thank you, Buck,
but I can get by on my own.

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:59.139
The thing is, you don't have to.

00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:04.060
I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.

00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:08.732
He's gonna be there, you know.

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:09.858
I know.

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:14.070
Look, whoever he used to be
and the guy he is now,

00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:16.907
I don't think he's the kind you save.

00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:18.575
He's the kind you stop.

00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:22.829
I don't know if I can do that.

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.123
Well, he might not give you a choice.

00:19:25.332 --> 00:19:26.791
He doesn't know you.

00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:28.543
He will.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.589
Gear up. It's time.

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:36.343
You gonna wear that?

00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:39.971
No. If you're gonna fight a war,
you got to wear a uniform.

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:49.314
Oh, man.

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.192
I am so fired.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.136
Careful, there.
It's a limited edition.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.577
Hey, uh, Ponytail Express.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.773
What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:32.971
832 miles.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.581
Very nice.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.330
I'm good like that.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.055
Can you, uh, stop that?

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.700
Break it, you bought it.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.051
I think I bought it.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.656
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.097
And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.296
- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.975
You're zip-tied to a bed.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.335
This.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.417
That.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.820
Are you coming out?

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.259
Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.934
All right. Let's go.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.291
You... You breathe fire? Okay.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.581
It's a glorious day, Savin.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.618
This time tomorrow,

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.297
I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:38.136
and the world's
most feared terrorist in the other.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.380
I'll own the war on terror.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.421
Create supply and demand.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.856
For you, for your brothers and sisters.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.138
Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.656
on the ground in five, four, three...

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.016
Come on! Two...

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.061
How did we get this shift?

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.621
All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:02.495
Put down your weapons.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.937
Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.411
In five, four, bang!

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:08.571
- Ooh!
- Wow. That was...

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.499
You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.100
I am just beyond terrified.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.701
Here it comes.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.138
- Three, four...
- Shut up.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.130
Five, four, three, two, one!

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.455
Told you.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.171
Where's the rest?

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.015
Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:42.779
Ah! Better late than never.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.697
Not this time.
Not the face.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.093
Phew! It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.501
<i>Oh, hello, sir.</i>

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.371
<i>All personnel, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</i>

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.061
<i>Repeat, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</i>

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.650
Ah! Let's go!

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.010
Aw, crap.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:22.811
Tony?

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:24.211
Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.372
- No. You got yours?
- Uh... Mmm.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.579
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.490
<i>There's somebody I'd like you to meet.</i>

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.021
You, you, you! Move! Get out!

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.611
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:42.330
What's this? I had winners.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.216
What have you come as?

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.732
You make a move,
and I break your face.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.697
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.171
This is the Mandarin?

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.253
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.134
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.340
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.299
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.174
there's some people I'd like to roll on.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.695
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.932
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.535
Doing what?

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.817
Oh! I get it! Ow! That hurt.
I get it! I get it!

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.618
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:23.691
Spill.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:24.851
Do you know
what they did to my suit?

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:25.977
What? No.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.538
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.012
Something to do with a big boat.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:33.455
I can take you there.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:35.979
Olé, olé, olé, olé!

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.054
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:43.135
Oh, and this next bit may include
the vice president as well.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:44.891
Is that...
Is that important?

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:46.734
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.571
So?

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.495
What are we gonna do?

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:53.651
I mean, we don't have any transport.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:54.731
Right.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.771
Hey, Ringo.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.456
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

00:26:02.684 --> 00:26:05.164
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

00:26:05.324 --> 00:26:06.371
But we also have to figure out this

00:26:06.444 --> 00:26:08.208
- vice president thing, right?
- Right.

00:26:08.284 --> 00:26:09.524
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

00:26:09.604 --> 00:26:10.804
Oh! That's the vice president.

00:26:10.844 --> 00:26:12.130
Thanks.

00:26:12.764 --> 00:26:13.890
Hello?

00:26:13.964 --> 00:26:15.648
<i>Sir, this is Tony Stark.</i>

00:26:15.964 --> 00:26:17.614
Welcome back to the land of the living.

00:26:17.764 --> 00:26:19.971
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.

00:26:20.044 --> 00:26:21.569
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

00:26:21.964 --> 00:26:24.365
Mr Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,

00:26:24.444 --> 00:26:26.685
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

00:26:26.764 --> 00:26:30.086
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

00:26:30.164 --> 00:26:31.211
I think we're good, here.

00:26:31.284 --> 00:26:33.286
<i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

00:26:33.644 --> 00:26:35.564
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

00:26:35.644 --> 00:26:37.009
<i>They're gonna take out
the president somehow.</i>

00:26:37.284 --> 00:26:38.845
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

00:26:39.004 --> 00:26:41.052
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

00:26:41.124 --> 00:26:44.048
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

00:26:44.204 --> 00:26:45.964
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Rhodes and Stark out.

00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:49.248
Everything okay, sir?

00:26:50.244 --> 00:26:51.325
Couldn't be better.

00:26:58.204 --> 00:26:59.694
I love you, babe.

00:27:20.525 --> 00:27:22.050
Colonel Rhodes.

00:27:22.125 --> 00:27:25.447
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

00:27:32.062 --> 00:27:34.631
<i>The universe rotates
on a 5,000-year cycle</i>

00:27:35.107 --> 00:27:37.485
and once a cycle,
all the worlds align.

00:27:38.152 --> 00:27:41.071
Imagine...
Imagine that this is our world.

00:27:41.822 --> 00:27:43.866
Thank you.
And this is another world.

00:27:44.033 --> 00:27:45.993
Normally, they're separate.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.870
But during the Alignment,

00:27:47.953 --> 00:27:51.499
everything is connected,
all nine realms.

00:27:51.665 --> 00:27:53.834
All nine realms are passing
through each other

00:27:53.918 --> 00:27:56.253
and gravity, light, and even matter,

00:27:56.545 --> 00:27:58.964
is crashing from
one world to the other.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:05.221
But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.

00:28:05.304 --> 00:28:09.809
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the Convergence.

00:28:10.518 --> 00:28:12.812
This time, the Alignment

00:28:12.895 --> 00:28:15.898
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.

00:28:16.065 --> 00:28:17.566
It's beautiful.

00:28:19.068 --> 00:28:21.237
It's simple. Any questions?

00:28:24.365 --> 00:28:25.407
Yeah.

00:28:25.666 --> 00:28:28.377
Can I have my shoe back?

00:28:29.104 --> 00:28:31.982
You'll have to sign for your
father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.

00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:33.567
What?

00:28:33.692 --> 00:28:35.027
Oh, yeah.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:38.113
My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.

00:28:39.823 --> 00:28:42.201
One man's leather wallet, brown.

00:28:42.284 --> 00:28:44.745
One key ring, three keys.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.789
Prescription medicine...

00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:48.791
Various.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.212
- And...
- Erik.

00:28:54.797 --> 00:28:56.215
- These.
- Yeah.

00:28:56.298 --> 00:28:57.508
Those.

00:28:58.008 --> 00:28:59.301
Thank goodness.

00:29:00.969 --> 00:29:02.179
Erik.

00:29:03.972 --> 00:29:05.098
Yes?

00:29:05.224 --> 00:29:06.892
It's Darcy.

00:29:07.017 --> 00:29:08.101
Darcy.

00:29:10.312 --> 00:29:12.105
So good to see you.

00:29:12.231 --> 00:29:13.273
I missed you, too.

00:29:13.398 --> 00:29:14.817
How did you find me?

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.151
You were naked on TV.

00:29:17.528 --> 00:29:19.655
Okay, time to go, lots to do.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.742
Getting weird now.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.287
I should not be left
in charge of stuff like this.

00:29:27.412 --> 00:29:31.250
I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.

00:29:31.333 --> 00:29:34.336
I'm Ian by the way,
Darcy's intern.

00:29:34.503 --> 00:29:36.672
Yeah, I don't get paid either.

00:29:37.548 --> 00:29:39.007
Are you all right?

00:29:39.174 --> 00:29:41.009
I've had a god in my brain.

00:29:42.344 --> 00:29:43.804
I don't recommend it.

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.724
Dr. Selvig, sir,
your gear is beeping at me.

00:29:47.808 --> 00:29:50.185
It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.

00:29:50.352 --> 00:29:51.979
Wait. What's happening?

00:29:55.274 --> 00:29:56.942
Birds?

00:29:57.067 --> 00:29:58.443
Birds are happening?

00:29:58.527 --> 00:30:00.779
They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.

00:30:00.946 --> 00:30:03.115
My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.

00:30:03.282 --> 00:30:04.783
- Nerd.
- Look!

00:30:09.371 --> 00:30:11.540
Where did they go?

00:30:24.344 --> 00:30:26.638
What the hell was that?

00:30:27.139 --> 00:30:28.807
Why are you smiling?

00:30:28.974 --> 00:30:30.183
There's nothing more reassuring

00:30:30.267 --> 00:30:33.979
than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.

00:30:34.062 --> 00:30:36.940
Take me to Jane's lab.

00:30:49.503 --> 00:30:50.963
Jane.

00:30:57.594 --> 00:30:58.929
Malekith.

00:31:21.201 --> 00:31:23.120
All right. Are you ready?

00:31:23.287 --> 00:31:24.538
I am.

00:31:38.177 --> 00:31:40.179
You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.

00:31:40.304 --> 00:31:42.181
Yes, possibly.

00:31:45.809 --> 00:31:47.019
You still don't trust me, brother?

00:31:48.645 --> 00:31:49.938
Would you?

00:31:58.864 --> 00:32:00.074
No, I wouldn't.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.330
Thor!

00:32:07.164 --> 00:32:08.749
No!

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.511
You really think I cared about Frigga?

00:32:20.594 --> 00:32:22.304
About any of you?

00:32:25.307 --> 00:32:26.308
All I ever wanted

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:28.852
was you and Odin

00:32:28.977 --> 00:32:30.062
dead at my feet!

00:32:42.699 --> 00:32:43.700
Malekith!

00:32:45.786 --> 00:32:47.788
I am Loki of Jotunheim,

00:32:47.955 --> 00:32:49.873
and I bring you a gift.

00:32:51.834 --> 00:32:53.669
I ask only one thing in return...

00:32:53.752 --> 00:32:57.172
A good seat from which
to watch Asgard burn.

00:33:17.109 --> 00:33:18.235
Look at me.

00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:17.753
Loki! Now!

00:37:32.989 --> 00:37:34.241
No!

00:37:43.458 --> 00:37:45.585
See you in hell, monster.

00:38:04.438 --> 00:38:05.897
No. No, no, no.

00:38:08.233 --> 00:38:10.485
Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.

00:38:10.569 --> 00:38:11.570
I know...

00:38:12.612 --> 00:38:14.781
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.

00:38:14.865 --> 00:38:16.032
Stay with me, okay?

00:38:16.116 --> 00:38:17.284
I'm sorry.

00:38:19.327 --> 00:38:21.538
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:38:21.663 --> 00:38:22.956
It's okay.

00:38:26.585 --> 00:38:28.086
It's all right.

00:38:28.211 --> 00:38:31.715
I'll tell Father
what you did here today.

00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:37.721
I didn't do it for him.

00:38:46.271 --> 00:38:48.648
No!

00:39:16.747 --> 00:39:18.999
<i>We are in final launch sequence.</i>

00:39:20.626 --> 00:39:22.544
We are go on guidance.

00:39:24.463 --> 00:39:26.590
<i>All personnel to launch stations.</i>

00:39:27.341 --> 00:39:28.508
And how was your flight?

00:39:28.717 --> 00:39:29.760
Lovely.

00:39:29.843 --> 00:39:32.346
The ride from the airport, less so.

00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:34.973
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't control everything.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.059
Including Captain America.

00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:43.065
This facility is biometrically controlled.

00:39:43.273 --> 00:39:46.151
And these will give you
unrestricted access.

00:39:50.113 --> 00:39:51.281
I've been parking there for two months.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.075
- But it's his spot.
- So where's he been?

00:39:53.283 --> 00:39:54.534
I think Afghanistan.

00:39:54.618 --> 00:39:56.620
Negative DT Six. The pattern is full.

00:39:56.828 --> 00:39:58.121
Well, he could've said something.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:01.083
Must be the dish.

00:40:02.876 --> 00:40:04.503
I'll check it out.

00:40:05.337 --> 00:40:08.340
<i>Triskelion command request
we clear the area for launch.</i>

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:12.970
Excuse us.

00:40:13.053 --> 00:40:15.514
<i>I know the road hasn't
exactly been smooth,</i>

00:40:16.014 --> 00:40:19.351
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.

00:40:21.603 --> 00:40:22.562
Finally, we're here.

00:40:23.313 --> 00:40:25.232
And the world should be grateful.

00:40:26.191 --> 00:40:27.901
<i>Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,</i>

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.861
<i>this is Steve Rogers.</i>

00:40:31.655 --> 00:40:33.865
<i>You've heard a lot about me
over the last few days.</i>

00:40:34.908 --> 00:40:37.160
<i>Some of you were even ordered
to hunt me down.</i>

00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:40.747
But I think it's time you know the truth.

00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:46.044
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

00:40:46.253 --> 00:40:47.963
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

00:40:49.089 --> 00:40:50.757
<i>Alexander Pierce is their leader.</i>

00:40:54.886 --> 00:40:57.222
<i>The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew
are HYDRA as well.</i>

00:40:57.431 --> 00:40:58.473
<i>I don't know how many more,</i>

00:40:59.766 --> 00:41:00.767
but I know they're in the building.

00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:04.438
<i>They could be standing right next to you.</i>

00:41:06.023 --> 00:41:07.691
<i>They almost have what they want.</i>

00:41:08.483 --> 00:41:10.569
<i>Absolute control.</i>

00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:12.404
They shot Nick Fury.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:14.656
<i>And it won't end there.</i>

00:41:15.198 --> 00:41:17.409
If you launch those helicarriers today,

00:41:17.576 --> 00:41:19.578
<i>HYDRA will be able to kill anyone
that stands in their way.</i>

00:41:22.873 --> 00:41:24.249
<i>Unless we stop them.</i>

00:41:28.253 --> 00:41:29.379
<i>I know I'm asking a lot.</i>

00:41:31.298 --> 00:41:34.468
<i>But the price of freedom is high.
It always has been.</i>

00:41:35.218 --> 00:41:37.095
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.

00:41:39.473 --> 00:41:42.267
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

00:41:43.935 --> 00:41:45.687
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

00:41:50.442 --> 00:41:53.737
Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?

00:41:54.237 --> 00:41:55.864
You smug son of a bitch.

00:41:59.951 --> 00:42:00.994
Arrest him.

00:42:03.872 --> 00:42:05.499
I guess I've got the floor.

00:42:12.381 --> 00:42:15.300
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.

00:42:19.679 --> 00:42:21.181
Is there a problem?

00:42:26.228 --> 00:42:27.312
Is there a problem?

00:42:27.479 --> 00:42:28.563
I'm sorry, sir.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.491
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

00:42:42.202 --> 00:42:43.495
Captain's orders.

00:42:43.703 --> 00:42:44.955
Move away from your station.

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.373
Like he said...

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:47.582
Hold it right there.

00:42:47.666 --> 00:42:49.000
Put the gun down!

00:42:49.167 --> 00:42:50.168
Captain's orders.

00:42:52.587 --> 00:42:54.005
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

00:42:55.841 --> 00:42:57.467
Depends on where you're standing.

00:43:41.845 --> 00:43:43.305
Close the bay door!

00:43:43.513 --> 00:43:44.723
Close the bay door now!

00:43:45.223 --> 00:43:46.183
Close the bay door!

00:44:06.036 --> 00:44:07.245
They're initiating launch.

00:44:34.059 --> 00:44:35.902
Oh! Here he comes.
Here he comes. Get a quick picture.

00:44:35.979 --> 00:44:37.026
Sure.

00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:39.214
Oh!

00:44:54.089 --> 00:44:55.289
Everything all right, Colonel?

00:45:28.089 --> 00:45:30.137
It is an honour, Mr President.

00:45:30.529 --> 00:45:32.531
If you're gonna do it, do it!

00:45:33.089 --> 00:45:34.853
Whoa! Cool your boots, sir.

00:45:34.929 --> 00:45:36.454
That's not how the Mandarin works.

00:45:36.609 --> 00:45:39.010
Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.

00:45:39.089 --> 00:45:41.012
Internal shots, temperature spikes.

00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:42.295
Get me eyes on it now.

00:45:42.649 --> 00:45:44.572
Image coming through now, sir.

00:45:46.969 --> 00:45:48.778
Was that Rhodes?

00:45:49.141 --> 00:45:50.267
We gotta make a decision.

00:45:50.341 --> 00:45:53.151
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.

00:45:53.301 --> 00:45:54.951
<i>Sir, I have an
update from Malibu.</i>

00:45:55.021 --> 00:45:57.149
<i>The cranes have finally arrived,</i>

00:45:57.301 --> 00:45:59.301
<i>and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.</i>

00:45:59.381 --> 00:46:01.065
And what about
the suit I'm wearing?

00:46:01.221 --> 00:46:03.508
<i>The armour is now at 92%.</i>

00:46:03.581 --> 00:46:05.663
That's going to have to do.

00:46:14.897 --> 00:46:16.262
Is anyone there?

00:46:16.577 --> 00:46:18.261
Let us out!

00:46:34.737 --> 00:46:36.227
The President.

00:46:36.737 --> 00:46:37.943
Now.

00:46:38.017 --> 00:46:39.018
He's not here.

00:46:43.177 --> 00:46:44.906
Try the jet stream?

00:46:46.097 --> 00:46:47.940
Speaking of which, go fish.

00:47:10.697 --> 00:47:12.665
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.

00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:26.658
How many in the air?

00:47:27.337 --> 00:47:28.384
<i>Thirteen, sir.</i>

00:47:30.297 --> 00:47:32.345
- How many can I carry?
- Four, sir.

00:47:41.697 --> 00:47:43.938
Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?

00:47:50.417 --> 00:47:52.988
Oh, God! No! No!

00:47:53.417 --> 00:47:55.818
Listen to me.
See that guy?

00:47:56.017 --> 00:47:57.858
I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.

00:47:58.297 --> 00:47:59.423
- You got it?
- What? Oh!

00:48:01.937 --> 00:48:05.259
I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.

00:48:06.497 --> 00:48:07.703
We can do this, Heather.

00:48:16.577 --> 00:48:18.818
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.

00:48:22.257 --> 00:48:24.305
Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?

00:48:24.377 --> 00:48:25.458
That's what we're going to do.

00:48:25.537 --> 00:48:26.823
<i>18,000 feet.</i>

00:48:26.897 --> 00:48:28.657
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.

00:48:33.337 --> 00:48:34.623
Nice.

00:48:34.977 --> 00:48:36.627
<i>10,000 feet.</i>

00:48:39.977 --> 00:48:41.217
<i>6,000 feet.</i>

00:48:41.417 --> 00:48:42.942
Come on, people.

00:48:43.897 --> 00:48:45.103
Come on, come on, come on!

00:48:48.417 --> 00:48:49.543
Yeah!

00:48:50.057 --> 00:48:51.468
<i>1,000 feet.</i>

00:48:52.617 --> 00:48:54.221
<i>400 feet.</i>

00:48:54.777 --> 00:48:56.017
<i>200 feet, sir.</i>

00:48:56.097 --> 00:48:57.737
He's a chunky monkey,
let's get him.

00:48:58.257 --> 00:48:59.418
Hello.

00:49:20.777 --> 00:49:21.858
We made it!

00:49:22.617 --> 00:49:24.062
Nice work, guys!

00:49:24.137 --> 00:49:26.788
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.

00:49:27.057 --> 00:49:28.138
All right, Jarvis.

00:49:28.257 --> 00:49:30.498
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...

00:49:37.657 --> 00:49:39.261
That came out of nowhere.

00:49:39.337 --> 00:49:40.543
Wow.

00:49:40.977 --> 00:49:42.103
Give me some good news, man.

00:49:42.177 --> 00:49:43.178
I think they all made it.

00:49:43.257 --> 00:49:44.224
Oh, thank God.

00:49:44.297 --> 00:49:45.618
Yeah, but I missed the president.

00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:47.660
You couldn't save the president
with the suit,

00:49:47.777 --> 00:49:49.905
how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?

00:49:49.977 --> 00:49:52.025
Uh... Say, Jarvis,
is it that time?

00:49:52.097 --> 00:49:54.020
<i>The House Party protocol sir?</i>

00:49:54.097 --> 00:49:55.144
Correct.

00:50:25.497 --> 00:50:26.862
Hi.

00:50:34.337 --> 00:50:36.704
You think he's gonna help you?

00:50:37.337 --> 00:50:38.782
He won't.

00:50:43.217 --> 00:50:47.142
Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um...

00:50:47.617 --> 00:50:50.348
Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.

00:50:50.417 --> 00:50:52.624
You're here as my, um...

00:50:53.537 --> 00:50:55.380
Trophy.

00:50:55.497 --> 00:50:57.545
Mmm.

00:51:07.657 --> 00:51:08.943
Good evening, sir.

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:16.302
Welcome aboard, Mr President.

00:51:41.242 --> 00:51:43.286
He's going to unleash it.

00:51:43.411 --> 00:51:48.583
Not just on Asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.

00:51:48.708 --> 00:51:49.834
How?

00:51:50.918 --> 00:51:52.086
Jane, how?

00:51:52.211 --> 00:51:55.423
I saw him on Earth.
Why would he go to Earth?

00:51:56.007 --> 00:51:57.383
The Convergence.

00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:58.718
Oh, God.

00:51:58.801 --> 00:52:00.803
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the Aether.

00:52:02.013 --> 00:52:03.765
Then Malekith would've
only possessed it

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:05.558
that much sooner.

00:52:05.641 --> 00:52:08.102
I only found it because
I was looking for you.

00:52:08.728 --> 00:52:09.979
Jane...

00:52:11.606 --> 00:52:13.316
Now we're trapped here.

00:52:19.864 --> 00:52:21.074
It's not me.

00:52:22.367 --> 00:52:23.576
Hello?

00:52:23.701 --> 00:52:24.911
<i>Hi, Jane, it's Richard.</i>

00:52:25.078 --> 00:52:26.829
Richard? Where are you?

00:52:26.954 --> 00:52:28.164
I'm still at the office.

00:52:28.289 --> 00:52:30.249
It's been a crazy day here today.

00:52:30.333 --> 00:52:32.251
- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
- <i>Is it?</i>

00:52:32.377 --> 00:52:33.586
<i>I quite enjoyed our lunch</i>

00:52:33.669 --> 00:52:35.755
despite never actually
ordering anything.

00:52:35.838 --> 00:52:37.256
How am I getting service here?

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.467
<i>Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?</i>

00:52:39.592 --> 00:52:42.762
No, no, no. Please, whatever you do,
do not hang up the phone.

00:52:43.638 --> 00:52:44.764
Okay, then.

00:52:44.847 --> 00:52:47.225
<i>I was just wondering
if you want to try again.</i>

00:52:47.308 --> 00:52:48.768
<i>Maybe dinner next time.</i>

00:52:48.851 --> 00:52:50.478
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:50.603 --> 00:52:52.855
- <i>Just stay on the phone, okay?</i>
- Yeah, I will.

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:54.941
Oh, my God.

00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.904
Am I interrupting something?

00:52:59.987 --> 00:53:01.697
No, no, no. Nothing at all.

00:53:01.864 --> 00:53:02.865
Come on.

00:53:02.949 --> 00:53:04.033
<i>I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?</i>

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.618
Where are we going?

00:53:05.701 --> 00:53:06.702
<i>Hello?</i>

00:53:06.828 --> 00:53:08.663
Why are there
so many shoes in here?

00:53:10.248 --> 00:53:12.083
I'll just text her.

00:53:24.387 --> 00:53:25.555
So, who's Richard?

00:53:25.721 --> 00:53:27.181
Really?

00:53:35.523 --> 00:53:36.983
- Jane!
- Hey.

00:53:37.066 --> 00:53:38.818
You can't just leave like that.

00:53:38.901 --> 00:53:40.194
The whole world is going crazy.

00:53:40.361 --> 00:53:42.196
All the stuff we saw is spreading.

00:53:43.698 --> 00:53:45.533
- Did you go to a party?
- Erik?

00:53:45.658 --> 00:53:49.328
Jane! How wonderful.

00:53:51.539 --> 00:53:53.374
- You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?

00:53:53.499 --> 00:53:55.251
He says it helps him think.

00:53:55.376 --> 00:53:56.961
Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.

00:53:57.044 --> 00:53:59.755
All the work you've been doing
on gravimetric anomalies, everything.

00:53:59.881 --> 00:54:01.048
Okay.

00:54:01.132 --> 00:54:02.216
Are you well, Erik?

00:54:03.676 --> 00:54:05.178
Your brother's not coming, is he?

00:54:06.179 --> 00:54:07.513
Loki is dead.

00:54:07.597 --> 00:54:08.681
Oh, thank God!

00:54:09.849 --> 00:54:12.059
I meant, I'm so sorry.

00:54:12.185 --> 00:54:13.728
Thank you.

00:54:37.335 --> 00:54:39.212
Forgive me, my liege.

00:54:40.046 --> 00:54:42.548
I've returned from
the Dark World with news.

00:54:45.009 --> 00:54:46.093
Thor?

00:54:46.761 --> 00:54:51.182
There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...

00:54:53.017 --> 00:54:54.227
What?

00:54:57.188 --> 00:54:58.814
We found a body.

00:55:03.528 --> 00:55:04.654
Loki.
