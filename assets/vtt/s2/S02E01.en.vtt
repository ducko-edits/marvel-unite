00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:30.804
On your left.

00:00:41.523 --> 00:00:42.732
On your left.

00:00:42.816 --> 00:00:44.860
On my left. Got it.

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:51.992
Don't say it. Don't you say it.

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:53.618
- On your left.
- Come on!

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.045
Need a medic?

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:08.466
I need a new set of lungs.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.887
Dude, you just ran, like,
13 miles in 30 minutes.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.971
I guess I got a late start.

00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:15.682
Really? You should be
ashamed of yourself.

00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:18.393
You should take another lap.

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:20.645
Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:22.397
What unit you with?

00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:23.940
58th Pararescue.

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.650
But now I'm working down at the VA.

00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:27.986
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

00:01:28.153 --> 00:01:30.322
I kind of put that together.

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:33.950
Must have freaked you out, coming
home after the whole defrosting thing.

00:01:34.868 --> 00:01:36.494
It takes some getting used to.

00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:38.079
It's good to meet you, Sam.

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:39.497
It's your bed, right?

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:41.666
What's that?

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:43.251
Your bed, it's too soft.

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:45.086
When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,

00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:47.172
use rock for pillows, like a caveman.

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:50.508
Now I'm home, lying in my bed,
and it's like...

00:01:50.634 --> 00:01:51.885
Lying on a marshmallow.

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:53.637
Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

00:01:55.013 --> 00:01:56.264
How long?

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:57.641
Two tours.

00:01:58.683 --> 00:02:00.101
You must miss the good old days, huh?

00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:03.521
Well, things aren't so bad.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.107
Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.

00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:07.484
No polio is good.

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:08.818
Internet, so helpful.

00:02:09.027 --> 00:02:10.403
I've been reading that a lot,
trying to catch up.

00:02:12.572 --> 00:02:16.534
Marvin Gaye, 1972, <i>Trouble Man</i> soundtrack.

00:02:16.743 --> 00:02:19.204
Everything you missed
jammed into one album.

00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:21.331
I'll put it on the list.

00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:31.383
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:33.218
If that's what you want to call running.

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:34.427
That's how it is?

00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:35.553
- That's how it is.
- Okay.

00:02:37.222 --> 00:02:39.557
Any time you want to stop by the VA,
make me look awesome

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:43.061
in front of the girl at the front desk,
just let me know.

00:02:43.228 --> 00:02:44.854
- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.

00:02:48.858 --> 00:02:50.402
Hey, fellas.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.362
Either one of you know
where the Smithsonian is?

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.780
I'm here to pick up a fossil.

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.240
That's hilarious.

00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:01.246
- How you doing?
- Hey.

00:03:02.706 --> 00:03:03.999
Can't run everywhere.

00:03:04.082 --> 00:03:05.083
No, you can't.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.211
Ow!

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.215
<i>Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...</i>

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.735
No. Forty-eight.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.774
Micro-repeater
implanting sequence complete.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.851
<i>As you wish, sir.</i>

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.020
<i>I've also prepared a safety briefing
for you to entirely ignore.</i>

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.700
Which I will.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.411
All right, let's do this.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.411
Hi, DUM-E.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.851
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.819
Hey. Hey!

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.332
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.697
Blood on my mat. Handle it.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.695
<i>Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?</i>

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.611
Focus up, ladies.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.535
Good evening,
and welcome to the birthing suite.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.017
<i>I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival</i>

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.054
<i>of your bouncing,
bad-ass baby brother.</i>

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.090
Start tight and then go wide.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.661
<i>Stamp date and time.</i>

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.814
<i>Mark 42. Autonomous
prehensile propulsion suit test.</i>

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.734
Initialise sequence.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.100
Jarvis, drop my needle.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.853
<i>♪ Dashing through the snow</i>

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.092
<i>♪ In a one horse open sleigh</i>

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.654
<i>♪ O'er the fields we go</i>

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.255
<i>♪ Laughing all the way</i>

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.295
<i>♪ Bells on bob tails ring</i>

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.576
Crap.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.017
<i>♪ Oh, what fun it is to sing</i>

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.535
<i>♪ A sleighing song tonight</i>

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.934
<i>♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

<i>♪ In a one horse open sleigh ♪</i>

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.651
All right, I think we got this.
Send them all.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.291
Probably a little fast.
Slow it down.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.731
Slow it down just a...

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.771
...little bit.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.170
Cool it, will you, Jarvis?

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.211
Come on. I ain't scared of you.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.851
I'm the best.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.460
<i>As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.</i>

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.615
Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:34.825
the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

00:06:35.158 --> 00:06:37.286
They were sending up their last
payload when pirates took them,

00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:39.204
93 minutes ago.

00:06:39.413 --> 00:06:41.164
- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.

00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:43.000
- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

00:06:45.502 --> 00:06:47.170
So it's not off-course. It's trespassing.

00:06:47.337 --> 00:06:48.839
I'm sure they have a good reason.

00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:50.716
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.

00:06:50.924 --> 00:06:52.759
Relax. It's not that complicated.

00:06:52.968 --> 00:06:54.052
How many pirates?

00:06:54.136 --> 00:06:56.680
25. Top mercs led by this guy.

00:06:57.472 --> 00:07:00.934
Georges Batroc. Ex-DGSE, Action Division.

00:07:01.143 --> 00:07:03.020
He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice.

00:07:03.687 --> 00:07:06.857
Before the French demobilized him,
he had 36 kill missions.

00:07:07.107 --> 00:07:08.692
This guy's got a rep
for maximum casualties.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.152
Hostages?

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:13.113
Mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.032
They're in the galley.

00:07:15.198 --> 00:07:16.658
What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?

00:07:16.867 --> 00:07:18.702
All right, I'm gonna sweep
the deck and find Batroc.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.370
Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:23.373
Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.334
get them to the life-pods, get them out.
Let's move.

00:07:25.417 --> 00:07:26.543
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap. Gear up.

00:07:40.682 --> 00:07:41.767
Secure channel seven.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:42.976
Seven secure.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.603
Did you do anything fun Saturday night?

00:07:44.853 --> 00:07:48.231
Well, all the guys from my
barbershop quartet are dead,

00:07:48.398 --> 00:07:49.941
so, no, not really.

00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:52.235
<i>Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.</i>

00:07:52.444 --> 00:07:55.447
You know, if you ask Kristen out,
from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

00:07:56.365 --> 00:07:57.324
That's why I don't ask.

00:07:59.242 --> 00:08:00.827
Too shy, or too scared?

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.954
Too busy!

00:08:04.414 --> 00:08:05.999
Was he wearing a parachute?

00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:07.250
No.

00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:08.919
No, he wasn't.

00:09:23.326 --> 00:09:24.327
Hey!

00:10:08.413 --> 00:10:09.414
Thanks.

00:10:09.664 --> 00:10:11.666
Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.

00:10:16.338 --> 00:10:18.006
What about the nurse that lives
across the hall from you?

00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:19.132
She seems kind of nice.

00:10:19.216 --> 00:10:20.842
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

00:10:21.051 --> 00:10:22.636
I'm multi-tasking.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.232
You want a bullet in your head?

00:11:03.593 --> 00:11:04.678
Okay.

00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:07.013
Hey, sailor.

00:11:43.466 --> 00:11:44.759
Hey!

00:12:37.562 --> 00:12:38.605
Targets acquired.

00:12:39.314 --> 00:12:40.357
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

00:12:41.483 --> 00:12:42.525
Natasha, what's your status?

00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:46.196
<i>Status, Natasha.</i>

00:12:46.363 --> 00:12:47.364
Hang on!

00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:04.547
Engine room secure.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.401
On my mark.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.195
<i>Three...</i>

00:13:27.404 --> 00:13:28.697
<i>Two... One.</i>

00:13:35.036 --> 00:13:38.081
I told you,
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't negotiate.

00:13:58.476 --> 00:14:00.603
Hostages en route to extraction.

00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:03.898
<i>Romanoff missed
the rendezvous point, Cap.</i>

00:14:04.482 --> 00:14:06.443
<i>Hostiles are still in play.</i>

00:14:06.609 --> 00:14:08.945
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

00:14:09.154 --> 00:14:11.197
Circle back to Rumlow
and protect the hostages.

00:14:12.115 --> 00:14:13.241
Natasha.

00:15:32.946 --> 00:15:34.489
Well, this is awkward.

00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:39.119
What are you doing?

00:15:39.285 --> 00:15:40.495
Backing up the hard drive.

00:15:40.578 --> 00:15:41.996
It's a good habit to get into.

00:15:42.497 --> 00:15:43.540
Rumlow needed your help.

00:15:43.665 --> 00:15:44.958
What the hell are you doing here?

00:15:48.545 --> 00:15:49.754
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:51.172
Whatever I can get my hands on.

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:52.715
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

00:15:52.841 --> 00:15:54.676
No, that's your mission,

00:15:56.511 --> 00:15:57.470
and you've done it beautifully.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.431
You just jeopardized
this whole operation.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.975
I think that's overstating things.

00:16:19.993 --> 00:16:21.119
Okay.

00:16:21.828 --> 00:16:23.037
That one's on me.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.415
You're damn right.

00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:47.249
Loki.

00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:48.959
Hello, Mother.

00:16:49.793 --> 00:16:51.336
Have I made you proud?

00:16:51.503 --> 00:16:53.880
Please, don't make this worse.

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:55.799
Define "worse."

00:16:55.966 --> 00:16:57.551
Enough!

00:16:57.718 --> 00:17:00.012
I will speak to the prisoner alone.

00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:16.403
I really don't see
what all the fuss is about.

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.948
Do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes?

00:17:20.073 --> 00:17:22.909
Wherever you go,
there is war, ruin,

00:17:23.577 --> 00:17:25.078
and death.

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:29.458
I went down to Midgard to rule
the people of Earth as a benevolent god.

00:17:30.334 --> 00:17:31.793
Just like you.

00:17:32.127 --> 00:17:35.756
We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.

00:17:36.131 --> 00:17:38.300
Just as humans do.

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:41.636
Give or take 5,000 years.

00:17:41.803 --> 00:17:45.557
All this because Loki desires a throne.

00:17:45.724 --> 00:17:47.059
It is my birthright.

00:17:47.225 --> 00:17:50.562
Your birthright was to die

00:17:51.063 --> 00:17:52.606
as a child.

00:17:53.732 --> 00:17:56.193
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:00.322
If I had not taken you in,

00:18:00.489 --> 00:18:03.116
you would not be
here now to hate me.

00:18:03.325 --> 00:18:05.410
If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,

00:18:05.494 --> 00:18:07.996
just swing it.

00:18:08.538 --> 00:18:10.207
It's not that I don't love
our little talks,

00:18:10.374 --> 00:18:12.292
it's just...

00:18:13.377 --> 00:18:15.045
I don't love them.

00:18:15.212 --> 00:18:17.381
Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:18.882
and you will never see her again.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.096
You will spend the rest of
your days in the dungeons.

00:18:27.224 --> 00:18:29.351
And what of Thor?

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:33.563
You'll make that witless oaf king
while I rot in chains.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.234
Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.

00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:38.902
He will bring order to the Nine Realms

00:18:39.069 --> 00:18:41.029
and then, yes...

00:18:41.947 --> 00:18:43.865
He will be king.

00:19:31.246 --> 00:19:32.956
I've got this completely under control!

00:19:33.123 --> 00:19:35.167
Is that why everything is on fire?

00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:00.734
You're welcome.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.423
All yours.

00:20:46.071 --> 00:20:47.072
Hello.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.993
I accept your surrender.

00:21:04.881 --> 00:21:06.216
Anyone else?

00:21:14.099 --> 00:21:17.644
Perhaps next time we should
start with the big one.

00:21:18.687 --> 00:21:20.855
Keep moving. Come on!

00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:34.786
Keep moving. Go ahead of me.
Don't you turn around!

00:21:35.829 --> 00:21:37.581
Where do we go next?

00:21:37.747 --> 00:21:41.710
Hogun, the peace is nearly won
across the Nine Realms.

00:21:42.836 --> 00:21:45.380
You should stay here.
Be with your people, where your heart is.

00:21:45.547 --> 00:21:47.132
Asgard can wait.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.510
You have my thanks.

00:21:51.303 --> 00:21:53.346
As you have mine.

00:21:57.559 --> 00:21:59.144
Heimdall, when you're ready.

00:22:44.082 --> 00:22:46.001
Is Vanaheim secure?

00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:47.627
As are Nornheim and Ria.

00:22:47.877 --> 00:22:50.130
Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.

00:22:51.214 --> 00:22:55.510
You must think I'm a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

00:22:55.885 --> 00:22:57.762
That was not my intent.

00:22:58.054 --> 00:23:00.265
For the first time since
Bifrost was destroyed,

00:23:00.348 --> 00:23:02.142
the Nine Realms are at peace.

00:23:02.309 --> 00:23:04.728
They're well reminded
of our strength

00:23:04.894 --> 00:23:09.524
and you have earned
their respect and my gratitude.

00:23:09.608 --> 00:23:10.734
Thank you.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.361
Nothing out of order

00:23:13.612 --> 00:23:16.656
except your confused
and distracted heart.

00:23:16.823 --> 00:23:19.075
This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.

00:23:19.492 --> 00:23:20.785
Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.

00:23:21.286 --> 00:23:23.204
You'd be better served
by what lies in front of you.

00:23:26.249 --> 00:23:27.667
I'm telling you this,
not as the Allfather,

00:23:27.751 --> 00:23:28.793
but as your father.

00:23:28.877 --> 00:23:29.878
You are ready.

00:23:30.211 --> 00:23:32.005
The time has come
for you to take the throne.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.882
Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.

00:23:34.466 --> 00:23:36.009
Join your warriors.

00:23:36.092 --> 00:23:38.553
Eat and drink,
revel in their celebration.

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:42.015
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.727
<i>Some people
call me a terrorist.</i>

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.411
<i>I consider myself a teacher.</i>

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.971
<i>America.</i>

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.240
<i>Ready for another lesson?</i>

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.568
<i>In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited</i>

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.889
<i>until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.</i>

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:28.250
<i>Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind</i>

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.644
<i>and claim their land.</i>

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.604
<i>39 hours ago,</i>

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.564
<i>the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.</i>

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.882
<i>I... I... I did that.</i>

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.326
<i>A quaint military church</i>

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.882
<i>filled with wives and children,
of course.</i>

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.928
<i>The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.</i>

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.241
<i>The braves were</i> away.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.805
<i>President Ems.</i>

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.248
<i>You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.</i>

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.045
<i>And now you've missed me again.</i>

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.003
<i>You know who I am.</i>

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.169
<i>You don't know where I am.</i>

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.206
<i>And you'll never see me coming.</i>

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.800
<i>Now that we seem to be back,</i>

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.405
<i>let's recap some
of the frightening developments...</i>

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.369
<i>American airwaves were hijacked...</i>

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.051
<i>The nation remains on high alert.</i>

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.800
<i>All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.</i>

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.209
<i>Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event</i>

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.403
<i>is a newly minted resource.</i>

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.769
<i>I know him
as Colonel James Rhodes.</i>

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.963
<i>The American people
will soon know him</i>

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.730
<i>as the tron Patriot.</i>

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.687
<i>And how is President Ems responding?</i>

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.922
<i>By taking the guy
they call War Machine</i>

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.650
<i>and giving him a paint job.</i>

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.407
<i>The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.</i>

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.371
<i>Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "Iron Patriot."</i>

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.364
<i>You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.</i>

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.523
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.330
"I am Iron Patriot!" It sucks.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.811
Listen. "War Machine"
was a little too aggressive.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.400
All right?
This sends a better message.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.723
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.247
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.885
It's classified information, Tony.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.448
Okay, there have been nine bombings.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.768
- Nine.
- The public only knows about three.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.923
But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.127
There's no bomb casings.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.528
You know I can help.
Just ask.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.330
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.090
I got bomb disposal.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.764
It catches explosions in mid-air.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.365
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.091
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.760
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.921
You're going to come at me like that?

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.761
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dick...

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.361
...tator.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.965
Do you mind signing my drawing?

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.207
If Richard doesn't mind.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.406
Are you all right with this, Dick?

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.084
Yeah. Fine with me.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.523
- What's your name?
- Erin.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.644
I loved you in <i>A Christmas Story,</i>
by the way.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.282
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.205
After New York, aliens... Come on.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.964
They need to look strong.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.204
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.084
- it's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.730
- I get it.
- It's American business.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.643
That's why I said I got it.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.811
Are you okay?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.481
I broke the crayon.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.324
Are you okay, Mr Stark?

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.480
Take it easy. Tony.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.408
How did you
get out of the wormhole?

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.167
Wait a minute. Tony!

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.680
- What did you say?
- Tony.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.969
Sorry.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.485
I'm just checking on the suit.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.641
Okay.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.326
Check the heart.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.845
Is it the brain?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.844
<i>No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.</i>

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.764
Okay, so I was poisoned?

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.162
<i>My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.</i>

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.806
Me?

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.964
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.128
Sorry, I gotta split.

00:28:22.929 --> 00:28:24.972
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

00:28:25.056 --> 00:28:26.098
I didn't lie.

00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:27.517
Agent Romanoff had a different
mission than yours.

00:28:27.725 --> 00:28:29.477
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.

00:28:29.685 --> 00:28:31.229
I'm not obliged to do anything.

00:28:31.395 --> 00:28:32.814
Those hostages could have died, Nick.

00:28:33.022 --> 00:28:36.609
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

00:28:36.818 --> 00:28:38.903
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

00:28:39.111 --> 00:28:40.738
Not a bunch of guys running
around shooting guns.

00:28:40.905 --> 00:28:44.116
Last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.

00:28:45.117 --> 00:28:48.538
Look, I didn't want you doing anything
you weren't comfortable with.

00:28:48.663 --> 00:28:50.790
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

00:28:50.998 --> 00:28:52.166
I can't lead a mission

00:28:52.375 --> 00:28:54.085
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

00:28:54.293 --> 00:28:56.921
It's called compartmentalization.

00:28:57.129 --> 00:28:59.799
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

00:29:00.758 --> 00:29:01.717
Except you.

00:29:05.429 --> 00:29:06.973
You're wrong about me.

00:29:07.807 --> 00:29:09.058
I do share.

00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:11.811
I'm nice like that.

00:29:13.938 --> 00:29:15.940
- Insight bay.
- <i>Captain Rogers does not have</i>

00:29:16.148 --> 00:29:17.316
<i>clearance for Project Insight.</i>

00:29:17.525 --> 00:29:19.986
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

00:29:20.111 --> 00:29:21.696
<i>Confirmed.</i>

00:29:24.282 --> 00:29:26.117
You know, they used to play music.

00:29:26.784 --> 00:29:27.785
Yeah.

00:29:27.952 --> 00:29:31.539
My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

00:29:31.747 --> 00:29:34.041
Granddad worked in a nice building.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.459
Got good tips.

00:29:36.043 --> 00:29:40.131
He'd walk home every night,
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

00:29:40.339 --> 00:29:41.632
He'd say, "Hi."

00:29:41.883 --> 00:29:43.718
People would say, "Hi" back.

00:29:44.468 --> 00:29:46.929
Time went on,
the neighborhood got rougher.

00:29:47.013 --> 00:29:48.014
He'd say, "Hi."

00:29:48.681 --> 00:29:50.558
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

00:29:50.766 --> 00:29:52.852
Granddad got to gripping
that lunch bag a little tighter.

00:29:53.811 --> 00:29:54.812
Did he ever get mugged?

00:29:56.939 --> 00:29:59.775
Every week some punk would say,
"What's in the bag?"

00:29:59.984 --> 00:30:01.652
What would he do?

00:30:01.861 --> 00:30:02.987
He'd show them.

00:30:03.654 --> 00:30:07.033
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

00:30:11.203 --> 00:30:12.872
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

00:30:13.831 --> 00:30:16.125
But he didn't trust them very much.

00:30:21.923 --> 00:30:23.633
Yeah, I know.

00:30:23.841 --> 00:30:26.177
They're a little bit bigger than a .22.

00:31:00.503 --> 00:31:02.922
This is Project Insight.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.299
Three next-generation helicarriers

00:31:05.508 --> 00:31:08.177
synced to a network
of targeting satellites.

00:31:08.386 --> 00:31:10.137
Launched from the <i>Lemurian Star</i>.

00:31:10.346 --> 00:31:13.307
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

00:31:13.557 --> 00:31:18.396
Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

00:31:18.604 --> 00:31:19.897
Stark?

00:31:19.981 --> 00:31:21.190
He had a few suggestions

00:31:21.273 --> 00:31:23.609
once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.

00:31:24.485 --> 00:31:26.904
These new long-range precision guns

00:31:27.071 --> 00:31:29.532
can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.911
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

00:31:34.412 --> 00:31:37.206
We're gonna neutralize a lot of threats
before they even happen.

00:31:37.415 --> 00:31:39.291
Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.918
We can't afford to wait that long.

00:31:41.085 --> 00:31:42.586
Who's "we"?

00:31:42.795 --> 00:31:45.047
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

00:31:45.256 --> 00:31:47.508
we needed a quantum
surge in threat analysis.

00:31:48.384 --> 00:31:50.594
For once, we're way ahead of the curve.

00:31:51.345 --> 00:31:54.265
By holding a gun to everyone
on Earth and calling it protection.

00:31:55.891 --> 00:31:57.935
You know, I read those SSR files.

00:31:58.728 --> 00:31:59.812
"Greatest Generation"?

00:32:00.563 --> 00:32:02.189
You guys did some nasty stuff.

00:32:02.398 --> 00:32:03.941
Yeah, we compromised.

00:32:04.442 --> 00:32:06.277
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

00:32:06.777 --> 00:32:09.030
But we did it so that
people could be free.

00:32:09.238 --> 00:32:11.449
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

00:32:11.615 --> 00:32:14.994
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is,
not as we'd like it to be.

00:32:15.202 --> 00:32:19.165
And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that program, Cap.

00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:22.001
Don't hold your breath.

00:33:01.707 --> 00:33:04.207
Cracking under the strain,
I threw the beast off.

00:33:04.707 --> 00:33:09.957
But, six more beat me to the ground,
crushing my blade as if it was paper.

00:33:10.957 --> 00:33:12.690
You're missing the best part.

00:33:15.098 --> 00:33:16.098
Where was I?

00:33:16.148 --> 00:33:18.348
- You were surrounded.
- Again.

00:33:18.447 --> 00:33:22.298
Yes, yes, yes, by the most vile criminals
the Nine Realms have ever produced.

00:33:22.848 --> 00:33:27.192
To our left, savage beasts
with fangs like knives.

00:33:27.193 --> 00:33:32.069
To our right, soldiers of fortune,
their blades dripping with blood.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.320
And who was there to face the horde,

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.320
- but Fandral the Dashing...
- I was.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.874
Hogun the Grim,
and Volstagg the...

00:33:40.124 --> 00:33:42.374
- Voluminous?
- Fat?

00:33:43.873 --> 00:33:44.873
Invincible!

00:33:45.747 --> 00:33:48.835
I don't mind telling you.
I feared for Thor's life.

00:33:49.586 --> 00:33:55.086
But, with steely courage,
intrepid spirit, and an axe,

00:33:55.335 --> 00:33:56.995
victory was ours!

00:33:59.433 --> 00:34:01.733
Truly, a tale for the ages.

00:34:02.183 --> 00:34:03.983
No doubt he'll be telling it
that long as well.

00:34:04.173 --> 00:34:05.173
Another!

00:34:42.384 --> 00:34:43.385
Hi.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:45.720
Hi.

00:34:46.012 --> 00:34:47.180
So, what's the story with you?

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.850
Why does there have to be a story?
There's no story.

00:34:50.016 --> 00:34:52.269
You spent the first
ten minutes of our date

00:34:52.352 --> 00:34:54.312
hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it.

00:34:54.896 --> 00:34:56.815
It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.025
I think there's a story

00:34:59.192 --> 00:35:02.362
and I'm thinking
the story involves a guy.

00:35:03.029 --> 00:35:04.364
It's complicated.

00:35:04.531 --> 00:35:05.699
Is he still around?

00:35:05.907 --> 00:35:07.826
No, he...

00:35:08.326 --> 00:35:09.494
Went away.

00:35:09.661 --> 00:35:11.037
I've been there.

00:35:11.204 --> 00:35:13.248
The going away.
It's hard, isn't it?

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.749
I was seeing a woman

00:35:15.041 --> 00:35:16.710
and she took a job in New York.

00:35:17.377 --> 00:35:19.171
Eventually, the distance killed it.

00:35:19.379 --> 00:35:22.716
And the fact that she kept
sleeping with other dudes.

00:35:22.883 --> 00:35:24.468
- No!
- Oh, so many.

00:35:25.886 --> 00:35:28.638
Hi. Could we get some wine, please?

00:35:28.805 --> 00:35:29.848
Sure, I'd love some.

00:35:29.973 --> 00:35:31.558
Richard, this is Darcy.

00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:34.060
What are you doing here?

00:35:36.271 --> 00:35:37.272
Oh. Hello.

00:35:37.522 --> 00:35:41.109
So, I show up to work at the lab,
slash, your mom's house,

00:35:41.234 --> 00:35:44.946
fully expecting you to be moping
around in your pajamas,

00:35:45.071 --> 00:35:46.781
eating ice cream
and obsessing about...

00:35:46.948 --> 00:35:47.949
You know who.

00:35:49.284 --> 00:35:51.703
But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.

00:35:51.828 --> 00:35:53.413
You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.

00:35:53.538 --> 00:35:54.539
Is there a point to all this?

00:35:54.623 --> 00:35:56.625
Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:57.959
Right.

00:35:58.502 --> 00:36:00.670
You know all that scientific equipment
you don't look at anymore?

00:36:01.588 --> 00:36:03.548
You might want to start
looking at it again.

00:36:03.673 --> 00:36:05.717
This is the reason we came
all the way out here.

00:36:05.842 --> 00:36:06.843
It's malfunctioning.

00:36:06.927 --> 00:36:07.928
That's what I said.

00:36:09.471 --> 00:36:10.889
That's what I did.

00:36:10.972 --> 00:36:12.933
I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.

00:36:13.099 --> 00:36:14.643
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...

00:36:14.726 --> 00:36:15.894
It doesn't look like nothing.

00:36:16.019 --> 00:36:18.230
It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.

00:36:18.563 --> 00:36:19.648
Our friend Erik

00:36:20.273 --> 00:36:21.775
kind of went banana balls.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.859
He's not interested.

00:36:22.943 --> 00:36:23.944
- I'm not interested.
- I'm interested.

00:36:24.194 --> 00:36:25.612
It's time for you to go now.

00:36:26.988 --> 00:36:28.073
Okay.

00:36:31.284 --> 00:36:32.452
Short but sweet.

00:36:32.536 --> 00:36:34.246
She needs help.

00:36:37.624 --> 00:36:39.459
I think I'm going
to have the sea bass.

00:36:39.626 --> 00:36:41.503
Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.

00:36:42.546 --> 00:36:46.967
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.

00:36:47.133 --> 00:36:49.594
Sea bass...

00:36:50.887 --> 00:36:51.888
Sea bass.

00:36:51.972 --> 00:36:53.390
Jane?

00:36:53.473 --> 00:36:55.058
Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"

00:36:55.141 --> 00:36:56.184
and go after your friend.

00:36:57.185 --> 00:36:58.311
This was so fun.

00:36:59.312 --> 00:37:01.231
I'll just stay here and
say "sea bass" alone.

00:37:08.864 --> 00:37:09.865
And I hate you.

00:37:10.407 --> 00:37:12.367
What? I said he was cute.

00:37:12.701 --> 00:37:14.536
Just shut up and drive.

00:37:20.677 --> 00:37:21.724
<i>Badge.</i>

00:37:22.117 --> 00:37:23.519
<i>Badge.</i>

00:37:23.677 --> 00:37:25.042
Come on, badge.

00:37:26.067 --> 00:37:28.718
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.

00:37:28.867 --> 00:37:31.074
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.

00:37:31.267 --> 00:37:33.307
- This is an asset that we can put to use.
- Uh-huh.

00:37:33.427 --> 00:37:37.398
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.

00:37:37.547 --> 00:37:39.072
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that

00:37:39.227 --> 00:37:42.231
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.

00:37:42.387 --> 00:37:44.628
We should start
phasing it out immediately.

00:37:44.787 --> 00:37:46.198
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,

00:37:46.267 --> 00:37:47.553
- you should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?

00:37:47.747 --> 00:37:49.237
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.

00:37:49.387 --> 00:37:52.038
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head of Security. Okay?

00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:53.837
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

00:37:53.907 --> 00:37:55.432
- However...
- I do appreciate it.

00:37:55.507 --> 00:37:57.430
- ...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.

00:37:57.627 --> 00:38:01.029
...we've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.

00:38:01.107 --> 00:38:02.188
Thank you.

00:38:02.707 --> 00:38:03.833
It's not a compliment.

00:38:03.907 --> 00:38:05.147
It's not...
It is a compliment.

00:38:05.307 --> 00:38:06.797
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.

00:38:06.987 --> 00:38:08.068
- I... Yes.
- Excuse me.

00:38:08.147 --> 00:38:10.115
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.

00:38:10.307 --> 00:38:11.638
- Thank you.
- Did you clear this 4:00 with me?

00:38:11.787 --> 00:38:13.516
Happy, we'll talk about this later,

00:38:13.627 --> 00:38:15.948
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

00:38:16.107 --> 00:38:17.438
How so?

00:38:17.587 --> 00:38:20.067
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,

00:38:20.107 --> 00:38:21.154
so it's a little awkward.

00:38:21.307 --> 00:38:23.071
I don't like the sound of that.

00:38:28.067 --> 00:38:29.068
Pepper.

00:38:30.027 --> 00:38:31.028
Killian?

00:38:31.187 --> 00:38:32.871
You look great.

00:38:33.187 --> 00:38:34.552
You look really great.

00:38:34.627 --> 00:38:36.914
God, you look great.

00:38:38.787 --> 00:38:40.148
What on earth have you been doing?

00:38:40.467 --> 00:38:41.468
Nothing fancy.

00:38:41.827 --> 00:38:43.875
Just five years in the hands
of physical therapists.

00:38:44.107 --> 00:38:45.916
And please, call me Aldrich.

00:38:46.067 --> 00:38:48.149
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge.

00:38:48.467 --> 00:38:50.708
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.

00:38:50.867 --> 00:38:53.347
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.

00:38:53.507 --> 00:38:55.547
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:58.432
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

00:39:04.627 --> 00:39:06.152
Hey, guy.

00:39:13.827 --> 00:39:14.828
Merry Christmas.

00:39:15.147 --> 00:39:17.718
After years dodging
the President's ban

00:39:17.827 --> 00:39:20.148
on "immoral" biotech research,

00:39:20.227 --> 00:39:21.558
my think tank

00:39:23.187 --> 00:39:25.713
now has a little something
in the pipeline.

00:39:26.587 --> 00:39:30.672
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.

00:39:31.787 --> 00:39:33.067
I'm gonna turn your lights down.

00:39:35.867 --> 00:39:37.710
Regard the human brain.

00:39:44.067 --> 00:39:45.227
Uh... Wait, hold on, hold on.

00:39:45.267 --> 00:39:47.156
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.

00:39:47.307 --> 00:39:49.116
But if I do that...

00:39:54.107 --> 00:39:55.711
That's the brain.

00:39:56.307 --> 00:39:58.230
Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?

00:39:58.307 --> 00:39:59.638
Wow, that's amazing.

00:39:59.747 --> 00:40:01.397
Thanks, it's mine.

00:40:01.467 --> 00:40:02.753
What?

00:40:03.387 --> 00:40:04.718
This. You're inside my head.

00:40:04.987 --> 00:40:06.876
It's a...
It's a live feed.

00:40:07.147 --> 00:40:08.797
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

00:40:10.427 --> 00:40:11.588
Come on.

00:40:14.587 --> 00:40:15.588
Now, pinch my arm.

00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:18.749
I can take it. Pinch me.

00:40:19.947 --> 00:40:21.187
What is that?

00:40:21.467 --> 00:40:24.596
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.

00:40:25.267 --> 00:40:28.191
But this is what I wanted to show you.

00:40:30.787 --> 00:40:34.951
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential

00:40:35.107 --> 00:40:37.951
and it goes here.

00:40:38.107 --> 00:40:41.236
This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us

00:40:41.467 --> 00:40:43.117
is that our mind,

00:40:43.187 --> 00:40:44.712
our entire DNA, in fact,

00:40:44.867 --> 00:40:46.710
is destined to be upgraded.

00:40:46.867 --> 00:40:47.948
Wow.

00:40:49.507 --> 00:40:50.747
Oh, wait...

00:40:50.947 --> 00:40:52.631
Uh...

00:40:56.027 --> 00:40:57.995
Hello?

00:40:58.307 --> 00:41:00.108
- Is this Forehead of Security?
- What?

00:41:00.347 --> 00:41:01.792
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?

00:41:01.947 --> 00:41:03.187
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.

00:41:03.347 --> 00:41:04.394
What, harassing interns?

00:41:04.467 --> 00:41:05.753
<i>Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened</i>

00:41:05.827 --> 00:41:06.828
<i>when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?</i>

00:41:06.907 --> 00:41:08.875
<i>They would laugh in my face.</i>

00:41:08.947 --> 00:41:11.348
<i>I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.</i>

00:41:11.507 --> 00:41:13.271
<i>Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.</i>

00:41:13.427 --> 00:41:15.156
What's going on? Fill me in.

00:41:15.307 --> 00:41:16.433
<i>- For real?</i>
- Yeah.

00:41:16.587 --> 00:41:18.112
<i>All right.
So, she's meeting up with this scientist.</i>

00:41:18.267 --> 00:41:19.837
<i>- Rich guy. Handsome.</i>
- Right.

00:41:19.947 --> 00:41:22.314
<i>I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.</i>

00:41:22.387 --> 00:41:23.388
- Oh, yeah, you're the best.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

00:41:23.467 --> 00:41:24.832
<i>Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.</i>

00:41:25.027 --> 00:41:27.428
<i>Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...</i>

00:41:27.627 --> 00:41:28.788
<i>Where were we in '99?</i>

00:41:28.867 --> 00:41:30.153
<i>- The science conference?</i>
- Um...

00:41:30.987 --> 00:41:32.796
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.

00:41:32.987 --> 00:41:34.352
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.

00:41:34.587 --> 00:41:35.952
Of course you don't remember.
He's not a blond with a big rack.

00:41:36.187 --> 00:41:37.677
<i>At first, it was fine.
They were tanking business.</i>

00:41:37.827 --> 00:41:40.910
But now it's, like, getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.

00:41:40.987 --> 00:41:42.751
- His what?
<i>- Big brain.</i>

00:41:42.827 --> 00:41:44.388
<i>And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.</i>

00:41:44.827 --> 00:41:46.477
Hold on. See?

00:41:47.027 --> 00:41:48.348
<i>Look at what? You, watching them?</i>

00:41:48.387 --> 00:41:50.151
<i>Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.</i>

00:41:50.347 --> 00:41:53.078
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.

00:41:53.307 --> 00:41:54.877
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.

00:41:55.067 --> 00:41:56.193
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!

00:41:56.507 --> 00:41:59.033
<i>Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.</i>

00:41:59.467 --> 00:42:00.707
<i>All right?
I don't work for you.</i>

00:42:01.507 --> 00:42:03.236
<i>And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.</i>

00:42:03.307 --> 00:42:04.354
<i>He's shifty.</i>

00:42:04.427 --> 00:42:05.428
- Relax.
<i>- Seriously?</i>

00:42:05.507 --> 00:42:07.032
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.

00:42:07.227 --> 00:42:08.433
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.

00:42:08.667 --> 00:42:10.192
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

00:42:10.547 --> 00:42:12.037
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you

00:42:12.107 --> 00:42:13.552
and you're just ignoring her.

00:42:13.707 --> 00:42:14.708
- A giant brain?
- Yeah.

00:42:14.787 --> 00:42:16.118
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.

00:42:16.187 --> 00:42:18.868
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...

00:42:19.027 --> 00:42:20.467
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.

00:42:21.147 --> 00:42:22.194
I miss you, Happy.

00:42:22.387 --> 00:42:24.389
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.

00:42:24.707 --> 00:42:25.708
<i>Now you're off with the super-friends.</i>

00:42:25.787 --> 00:42:26.993
<i>I don't know
what's going on with you any more.</i>

00:42:27.067 --> 00:42:28.148
<i>- The world's getting weird.</i>
- Hey!

00:42:28.227 --> 00:42:29.228
I hate to cut you off.

00:42:29.307 --> 00:42:30.308
- Do you have your Taser on you?
<i>- Why?</i>

00:42:30.387 --> 00:42:32.594
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.

00:42:32.667 --> 00:42:34.749
You should probably go over there
and zap her.

00:42:34.867 --> 00:42:36.153
<i>Yeah, nice.</i>

00:42:36.627 --> 00:42:41.076
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism

00:42:41.227 --> 00:42:43.195
and recode its DNA.

00:42:43.467 --> 00:42:45.276
- That would be incredible.
- Hmm.

00:42:45.427 --> 00:42:49.068
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.

00:42:49.227 --> 00:42:52.834
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...

00:42:52.987 --> 00:42:54.591
Tony, Tony.

00:42:55.627 --> 00:43:00.394
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.

00:43:00.467 --> 00:43:01.514
He turned me down.

00:43:02.587 --> 00:43:06.034
But something tells me
now there's a new genius on the throne

00:43:06.107 --> 00:43:09.395
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony any more

00:43:09.467 --> 00:43:11.435
and who has slightly less of an ego.

00:43:12.947 --> 00:43:15.518
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.

00:43:16.147 --> 00:43:18.991
As much as I'd like to help you.

00:43:20.267 --> 00:43:23.589
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.

00:43:23.947 --> 00:43:25.392
But then,
as my father used to say,

00:43:25.467 --> 00:43:28.232
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."

00:43:28.427 --> 00:43:29.792
- That's very deep.
- Hmm.

00:43:29.867 --> 00:43:31.278
And I have no idea
what it means.

00:43:31.467 --> 00:43:33.629
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

00:43:35.307 --> 00:43:38.277
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

00:43:48.027 --> 00:43:49.028
Happy.

00:43:50.467 --> 00:43:52.231
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.

00:43:54.587 --> 00:43:56.077
Yes, I just, um...

00:43:56.147 --> 00:43:59.549
God, I forgot my other things, so...

00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:01.752
I'm just gonna...

00:44:18.156 --> 00:44:20.116
<i>Welcome to the Smithsonian.</i>

00:44:20.283 --> 00:44:23.787
<i>Visitor information booths
are available on the second level.</i>

00:44:32.837 --> 00:44:34.965
<i>A symbol to the nation.</i>

00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:37.926
<i>A hero to the world.</i>

00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:45.141
<i>The story of Captain America is one
of honor, bravery and sacrifice.</i>

00:44:49.813 --> 00:44:52.607
<i>Denied enlistment due to poor health,</i>

00:44:52.816 --> 00:44:55.026
<i>Steven Rogers was chosen for a program</i>

00:44:55.235 --> 00:44:58.363
<i>unique in the annals of American warfare.</i>

00:44:59.364 --> 00:45:04.327
<i>One that would transform him
into the world's first Super-Soldier.</i>

00:45:11.001 --> 00:45:12.002
<i>In this rare footage,</i>

00:45:12.168 --> 00:45:14.504
<i>everyone's favorite war hero,
Captain America...</i>

00:45:14.671 --> 00:45:16.172
<i>Battle tested,</i>

00:45:16.339 --> 00:45:17.340
<i>Captain America</i>

00:45:17.716 --> 00:45:20.844
<i>and his Howling Commandos
quickly earned their stripes.</i>

00:45:21.011 --> 00:45:22.053
<i>Their mission:</i>

00:45:22.429 --> 00:45:26.057
<i>taking down HYDRA,
the Nazi rogue science division.</i>

00:45:29.394 --> 00:45:31.396
<i>Best friends since childhood,</i>

00:45:32.355 --> 00:45:35.692
<i>Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers
were inseparable</i>

00:45:35.859 --> 00:45:37.736
<i>on both schoolyard and battlefield.</i>

00:45:39.154 --> 00:45:43.199
<i>Barnes is the only Howling
Commando to give his life</i>

00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:45.910
<i>in service of his country.</i>

00:45:50.999 --> 00:45:52.584
<i>That was a difficult winter.</i>

00:45:52.792 --> 00:45:56.212
<i>A blizzard had trapped half
our battalion behind the German line.</i>

00:45:57.047 --> 00:46:00.091
<i>Steve, Captain Rogers,</i>

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.927
<i>he fought his way through
a HYDRA blockade</i>

00:46:03.136 --> 00:46:05.680
<i>that had pinned our allies
down for months.</i>

00:46:07.641 --> 00:46:09.059
<i>He saved over 1,000 men.</i>

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.645
<i>Including the man who would...</i>

00:46:12.937 --> 00:46:15.899
<i>Who would become my husband,
as it turned out.</i>

00:46:16.775 --> 00:46:19.569
<i>Even after he died,
Steve was still changing my life.</i>

00:46:22.572 --> 00:46:24.074
You should be proud of yourself, Peggy.

00:46:32.457 --> 00:46:34.584
I have lived a life.

00:46:36.503 --> 00:46:39.714
My only regret is that you
didn't get to live yours.

00:46:42.926 --> 00:46:43.968
What is it?

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:50.183
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

00:46:51.643 --> 00:46:53.937
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is anymore.

00:46:56.815 --> 00:47:01.194
And I thought I could throw
myself back in and follow orders.

00:47:01.277 --> 00:47:02.737
Serve.

00:47:05.907 --> 00:47:07.992
It's just not the same.

00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:09.994
You're always so dramatic.

00:47:13.248 --> 00:47:16.835
Look, you saved the world.

00:47:19.295 --> 00:47:23.133
We rather mucked it up.

00:47:23.508 --> 00:47:24.801
You didn't.

00:47:25.343 --> 00:47:29.055
Knowing that you helped found S.H.I.E.L.D.
is half the reason I stay.

00:47:29.931 --> 00:47:30.932
Hey.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:38.022
The world has changed,
and none of us can go back.

00:47:39.232 --> 00:47:41.401
All we can do is our best.

00:47:41.609 --> 00:47:45.822
And sometimes the best
that we can do is to start over.

00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:54.330
Peggy.

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:01.171
Steve.

00:48:02.005 --> 00:48:03.047
Yeah?

00:48:04.716 --> 00:48:06.009
You're alive.

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:09.763
You came back.

00:48:10.013 --> 00:48:11.014
Yeah, Peggy.

00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:16.811
It's been so long.

00:48:19.355 --> 00:48:20.815
So long.

00:48:21.858 --> 00:48:24.402
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.

00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:26.696
Not when she owes me a dance.

00:48:32.702 --> 00:48:34.078
Secure office.

00:48:42.003 --> 00:48:44.881
Open <i>Lemurian Star's</i>
satellite launch file.

00:48:45.924 --> 00:48:47.634
<i>Access denied.</i>

00:48:48.343 --> 00:48:49.344
Run decryption.

00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:53.890
<i>Decryption failed.</i>

00:48:54.057 --> 00:48:56.768
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

00:48:58.812 --> 00:49:01.815
<i>Override denied. All files sealed.</i>

00:49:02.023 --> 00:49:03.483
On whose authority?

00:49:03.691 --> 00:49:05.902
<i>Fury, Nicholas J.</i>

00:49:11.673 --> 00:49:12.757
World Security Council.

00:49:12.924 --> 00:49:14.134
<i>Confirmed.</i>

00:49:16.761 --> 00:49:19.055
<i>If Nick Fury thinks he can
get his costumed thugs</i>

00:49:19.264 --> 00:49:22.475
<i>and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to mop up
his mess, he's sadly mistaken.</i>

00:49:22.684 --> 00:49:23.852
This failure is unacceptable.

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.645
Considering this attack took place

00:49:25.854 --> 00:49:27.605
one mile from my country's
sovereign waters,

00:49:27.772 --> 00:49:30.191
it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.277
We don't need hearings, we need action.

00:49:32.444 --> 00:49:34.571
It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:49:34.863 --> 00:49:36.740
A breach like this raises
serious questions.

00:49:36.948 --> 00:49:38.616
Like how the hell did a French pirate

00:49:38.825 --> 00:49:42.704
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?

00:49:42.912 --> 00:49:44.956
For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.

00:49:45.623 --> 00:49:47.625
I can draw a map if it'd help.

00:49:47.792 --> 00:49:50.628
I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce.

00:49:51.463 --> 00:49:54.382
But this Council takes things like
international piracy fairly seriously.

00:49:54.632 --> 00:49:57.802
Really? I don't.

00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:01.806
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

00:50:02.932 --> 00:50:05.727
If this Council is going to fall to rancor

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:08.480
every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,

00:50:09.731 --> 00:50:11.775
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

00:50:11.983 --> 00:50:14.486
Mr. Secretary, nobody is suggesting...

00:50:18.573 --> 00:50:19.616
Excuse me.

00:50:19.699 --> 00:50:21.284
More trouble, Mr. Secretary?

00:50:21.493 --> 00:50:23.078
Depends on your definition.

00:50:31.836 --> 00:50:34.923
I work 40 floors away and it takes
a hijacking for you to visit?

00:50:35.131 --> 00:50:37.217
A nuclear war would do it, too.

00:50:38.384 --> 00:50:39.636
You busy in there?

00:50:39.844 --> 00:50:41.346
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

00:50:43.348 --> 00:50:46.643
I'm here to ask a favor.

00:50:47.435 --> 00:50:49.312
I want you to call for a vote.

00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:51.606
Project Insight has to be delayed.

00:50:52.023 --> 00:50:54.192
Nick, that's not a favor,

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.902
that's a sub-committee hearing.
A long one.

00:50:56.111 --> 00:50:57.737
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

00:50:57.946 --> 00:51:00.573
I just need time to make
sure it's nothing.

00:51:00.782 --> 00:51:01.825
But if it's something?

00:51:02.033 --> 00:51:04.828
Then we'll both be damn glad
those helicarriers aren't in the air.

00:51:06.955 --> 00:51:07.914
Fine.

00:51:08.665 --> 00:51:12.168
But you got to get Iron Man
to stop by my niece's birthday party.

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:13.962
Thank you, sir.

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.048
And not just a flyby. He's got to mingle.

00:51:39.842 --> 00:51:41.003
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...

00:51:41.082 --> 00:51:42.447
What the...
What is that?

00:51:44.002 --> 00:51:46.050
You're wearing this in the house now?

00:51:46.242 --> 00:51:47.732
What is that, like, Mark 15?

00:51:48.122 --> 00:51:49.533
Uh, yeah.

00:51:49.722 --> 00:51:51.611
Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.

00:51:51.682 --> 00:51:53.889
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

00:51:53.962 --> 00:51:55.691
Just breaking it in.

00:51:55.762 --> 00:51:57.605
You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag

00:51:57.722 --> 00:51:58.883
at first, so...

00:51:58.962 --> 00:52:01.124
Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?

00:52:01.362 --> 00:52:02.568
Yes, I did. I...

00:52:02.642 --> 00:52:05.168
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.

00:52:05.242 --> 00:52:07.290
Is it gonna fit through the door?

00:52:07.522 --> 00:52:08.683
Well, actually,
it's a good question.

00:52:08.962 --> 00:52:11.329
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.

00:52:11.402 --> 00:52:12.847
- Okay.
- So, uh...

00:52:12.962 --> 00:52:14.612
Tense? Good day? Huh?

00:52:14.682 --> 00:52:17.367
Ooh, shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.

00:52:17.442 --> 00:52:21.049
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?

00:52:21.242 --> 00:52:22.243
Did I like it?

00:52:22.682 --> 00:52:24.093
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.

00:52:24.162 --> 00:52:26.972
I appreciate the thought very much.

00:52:28.162 --> 00:52:31.644
So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?

00:52:31.802 --> 00:52:33.531
Huh...

00:52:33.922 --> 00:52:36.448
Yep. Damn it, no can do.

00:52:36.522 --> 00:52:38.570
You want to just kiss it on the...

00:52:38.642 --> 00:52:40.406
- The facial slit?
- Uh-huh.

00:52:40.482 --> 00:52:42.484
Well, why don't I
run down to the garage

00:52:42.562 --> 00:52:45.168
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to jimmy that thing open?

00:52:45.242 --> 00:52:46.892
Crowbar, yeah.

00:52:46.962 --> 00:52:49.329
Oh! Except there's been
a radiation leak.

00:52:49.402 --> 00:52:51.325
- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.

00:52:51.642 --> 00:52:52.803
At least, let me get you

00:52:52.882 --> 00:52:54.532
like, a hazmat suit you can...

00:52:55.962 --> 00:52:58.163
A Geiger counter or something like that.

00:52:59.162 --> 00:53:00.209
Busted.

00:53:00.682 --> 00:53:03.891
- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.

00:53:04.042 --> 00:53:06.409
You ate without me already?
On date night?

00:53:07.282 --> 00:53:08.522
- He was just...
- You mean you.

00:53:08.602 --> 00:53:11.253
Well, yeah, I just mean
we were just hosting you...

00:53:12.602 --> 00:53:14.252
- ...while I finished up a little work.
- Uh-huh.

00:53:14.442 --> 00:53:15.648
And yes, I had a quick bite.

00:53:15.722 --> 00:53:16.689
I didn't know if you were coming home

00:53:16.762 --> 00:53:18.603
or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.

00:53:22.002 --> 00:53:23.652
- What?
- What?

00:53:23.722 --> 00:53:26.328
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?

00:53:26.402 --> 00:53:27.403
Happy was concerned.

00:53:27.482 --> 00:53:28.608
- No, you're spying on me.
- I wasn't.

00:53:28.682 --> 00:53:29.842
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.

00:53:29.882 --> 00:53:32.362
Come on. Pep?

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:33.443
Hey, I admit it.

00:53:33.602 --> 00:53:36.572
My fault. Sorry.

00:53:37.082 --> 00:53:39.767
I'm a piping hot mess.

00:53:41.002 --> 00:53:44.973
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.

00:53:45.802 --> 00:53:47.531
Nothing's been the same
since New York.

00:53:48.562 --> 00:53:52.089
Oh, really?
I didn't notice that at all.

00:53:52.682 --> 00:53:54.764
You experience things

00:53:54.842 --> 00:53:57.043
and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.

00:53:57.722 --> 00:54:01.727
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.

00:54:01.802 --> 00:54:03.242
The only reason I haven't cracked up

00:54:03.482 --> 00:54:05.246
is probably because you moved in.

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:06.723
Which is great.

00:54:06.802 --> 00:54:08.372
I love you. I'm lucky.

00:54:08.642 --> 00:54:11.407
But honey, I can't sleep.

00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:15.811
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.

00:54:15.882 --> 00:54:17.646
I tinker. I...

00:54:18.642 --> 00:54:20.565
Threat is imminent.

00:54:20.642 --> 00:54:24.283
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.

00:54:24.362 --> 00:54:26.091
That's you.

00:54:26.162 --> 00:54:28.403
And my suits, they're, uh...

00:54:28.482 --> 00:54:29.483
Machines.

00:54:29.842 --> 00:54:31.332
They're part of me.

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:33.606
A distraction.

00:54:34.242 --> 00:54:35.767
Maybe.

00:54:53.002 --> 00:54:55.448
I'm gonna take a shower.

00:54:55.522 --> 00:54:57.251
Okay.

00:54:59.682 --> 00:55:00.683
And you're gonna join me.

00:55:02.482 --> 00:55:03.847
Better.

00:55:06.203 --> 00:55:07.204
You need to take the next left.

00:55:08.664 --> 00:55:10.415
- Who's he?
- He's my intern.

00:55:10.957 --> 00:55:12.751
- You have an intern?
- Oh, yeah.

00:55:13.001 --> 00:55:14.878
Hello, Dr. Foster.

00:55:15.003 --> 00:55:16.588
It's such a great honor
to be working with you.

00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:18.756
- Right.
- Oh, take a right.

00:55:21.505 --> 00:55:22.589
And a left.

00:55:24.175 --> 00:55:27.136
I have totally mastered
driving in London.

00:55:28.935 --> 00:55:30.729
Come on, this is exciting.

00:55:31.396 --> 00:55:33.023
Look! The intern is excited.

00:55:33.231 --> 00:55:34.358
"Ian."

00:55:34.483 --> 00:55:35.942
Do you want the phase meter?

00:55:36.026 --> 00:55:37.486
- No.
- Bring the phase meter.

00:55:38.403 --> 00:55:39.446
The toaster-looking thing.

00:55:39.613 --> 00:55:42.157
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.

00:55:49.831 --> 00:55:52.209
How do I change
the ringtone on this thing?

00:55:52.292 --> 00:55:54.252
An astrophysicist with three degrees

00:55:54.336 --> 00:55:56.088
should be able to change
her own ringtone.

00:55:56.213 --> 00:55:57.673
Why are you calling me?

00:55:57.756 --> 00:56:00.008
I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.

00:56:00.092 --> 00:56:01.593
"Ian." My name is Ian.

00:56:15.649 --> 00:56:19.319
I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.

00:56:19.444 --> 00:56:20.946
It's okay, we're Americans.

00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:22.989
Is that supposed to make them like us?

00:56:23.073 --> 00:56:24.825
They'll make it go away.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.745
Oh, they're kids.

00:56:29.079 --> 00:56:30.205
Are you the police?

00:56:30.831 --> 00:56:33.542
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.

00:56:33.834 --> 00:56:34.918
Thanks.

00:56:35.043 --> 00:56:36.712
We just found it.

00:56:38.922 --> 00:56:40.132
Can you show us?

00:57:06.616 --> 00:57:09.119
That doesn't seem right.

00:57:26.011 --> 00:57:27.179
Where'd it go?

00:57:40.734 --> 00:57:41.735
That's...

00:57:42.319 --> 00:57:43.403
That's incredible!

00:57:57.125 --> 00:57:58.543
What happened?

00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:00.086
Sometimes they come back.

00:58:00.378 --> 00:58:01.797
Sometimes they don't.

00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:05.967
I want to throw something!

00:58:06.092 --> 00:58:07.219
Jane, give me your shoe.

00:58:09.721 --> 00:58:12.015
I haven't seen readings
like this since...

00:58:12.641 --> 00:58:13.642
Since...

00:58:13.767 --> 00:58:14.768
New Mexico?

00:58:19.314 --> 00:58:21.233
Don't touch anything!

00:58:23.985 --> 00:58:25.570
Give me your shoe.

00:58:44.132 --> 00:58:45.543
Tony.

00:58:46.132 --> 00:58:48.658
Tony. Tony.

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:51.062
To...

00:58:54.172 --> 00:58:55.333
Power down!

00:59:02.932 --> 00:59:05.333
I must have called it in my sleep.

00:59:05.412 --> 00:59:07.699
That's not supposed to happen.

00:59:10.172 --> 00:59:12.220
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

00:59:14.092 --> 00:59:17.096
Can we just... Just let me...

00:59:17.172 --> 00:59:19.618
Just let me catch my breath. Hey,
don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...

00:59:19.692 --> 00:59:21.820
I'm going to sleep downstairs.

00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:24.179
Tinker with that.

00:59:25.866 --> 00:59:27.034
<i>The thing is,</i>

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.620
I think it's getting worse.

00:59:30.871 --> 00:59:33.165
A cop pulled me over last week.

00:59:33.374 --> 00:59:34.625
He thought I was drunk.

00:59:35.793 --> 00:59:39.297
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

00:59:40.715 --> 00:59:42.508
I thought it was an IED.

00:59:44.802 --> 00:59:46.679
Some stuff you leave there.

00:59:47.013 --> 00:59:49.056
Other stuff you bring back.

00:59:49.223 --> 00:59:52.143
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

00:59:52.351 --> 00:59:56.522
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?

00:59:57.690 --> 00:59:58.733
It's up to you.

00:59:59.942 --> 01:00:01.277
- I'll see you next week.
- Definitely.

01:00:03.321 --> 01:00:05.614
Look who it is, the running man.

01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:08.909
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.

01:00:09.118 --> 01:00:12.079
Yeah, brother,
we all got the same problems.

01:00:12.788 --> 01:00:13.998
Guilt,

01:00:14.457 --> 01:00:15.666
regret.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.793
You lose someone?

01:00:18.461 --> 01:00:20.838
My wingman, Riley.

01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:22.923
Flying a night mission.

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:25.426
Standard PJ rescue op.

01:00:25.634 --> 01:00:27.678
Nothing we hadn't done
1,000 times before.

01:00:27.887 --> 01:00:31.474
Until an RPG knocked Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.

01:00:33.601 --> 01:00:34.935
Nothing I could do.

01:00:35.519 --> 01:00:37.521
It's like I was up there just to watch.

01:00:38.647 --> 01:00:40.608
- I'm sorry.
- After that,

01:00:40.775 --> 01:00:44.403
I had a really hard time finding a reason
for being over there, you know?

01:00:46.364 --> 01:00:48.616
But you're happy now, back in the world?

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:53.079
The number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero.

01:00:53.287 --> 01:00:54.288
So, hell yeah.

01:00:55.414 --> 01:00:56.457
Are you thinking about getting out?

01:00:57.458 --> 01:00:58.459
No.

01:01:00.503 --> 01:01:01.629
I don't know.

01:01:03.172 --> 01:01:05.716
To be honest, I don't know what
I would do with myself if I did.

01:01:06.258 --> 01:01:07.259
Ultimate fighting?

01:01:08.094 --> 01:01:10.471
Just a great idea off the top of my head.

01:01:10.638 --> 01:01:13.057
Seriously, you could do
whatever you want to do.

01:01:14.058 --> 01:01:15.101
What makes you happy?

01:01:17.019 --> 01:01:18.687
I don't know.

01:01:39.648 --> 01:01:42.109
Were those the car keys?

01:02:19.813 --> 01:02:20.814
Darcy!

01:03:28.532 --> 01:03:31.327
<i>Activating communications

<i>Confirmed.</i>

01:03:36.707 --> 01:03:37.750
<i>This is Hill.</i>

01:03:37.917 --> 01:03:39.752
I need you here in D.C.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.671
Deep shadow conditions.

01:03:43.339 --> 01:03:44.507
<i>Give me four hours.</i>

01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:46.175
You have three. Over.

01:04:02.441 --> 01:04:04.109
Want to see my lease?

01:04:22.044 --> 01:04:23.254
<i>Fracture detected.</i>

01:04:26.423 --> 01:04:28.801
