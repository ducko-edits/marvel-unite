WEBVTT

00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:17.247
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.514
Everything he knows about.

00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:21.934
Herr Strucker, if they
get word of our work here,

00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:23.936
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

00:00:24.144 --> 00:00:25.854
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:00:26.855 --> 00:00:29.691
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

00:00:33.528 --> 00:00:35.030
What we have

00:00:37.074 --> 00:00:39.701
is worth more than any of them ever knew.

00:00:42.137 --> 00:00:45.849
We've only scratched
the surface and already,

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:52.673
there are other facilities doing HYDRA's
good work around the world.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.260
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colorful friends,

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.304
and keep them off our scent.

00:00:59.513 --> 00:01:01.765
What about the volunteers?

00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:03.517
The dead will be buried so deep

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:05.852
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:09.189
And the survivors?

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:12.818
The twins.

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:19.491
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.

00:01:21.702 --> 00:01:23.620
It's not a world of spies anymore.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.789
Not even a world of heroes.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.501
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

00:01:31.378 --> 00:01:33.672
There's nothing more horrifying

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:35.632
than a miracle.

00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:21.290
<i>Report to your stations immediately.</i>

00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:23.084
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:24.210
<i>We are under attack!</i>

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:27.588
<i>We are under attack!</i>

00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.985
- Shit!
- Language!

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.695
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.155
<i>The central building is</i>

00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:36.783
<i>protected by some kind of energy shield.</i>

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:38.743
<i>Strucker's technology is well beyond</i>

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:40.995
<i>any other Hydra base we've taken.</i>

00:03:43.873 --> 00:03:45.416
Loki's scepter must be here.

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:47.710
Strucker couldn't mount
this defense without it.

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.213
At long last.

00:04:01.682 --> 00:04:03.893
"At long last" is lasting a little long, boys.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:11.317
Yeah. I think we lost
the element of surprise.

00:04:12.902 --> 00:04:15.112
Wait a second. No one else
is gonna deal with the fact

00:04:15.238 --> 00:04:17.031
that Cap just said "Language"?

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.699
I know.

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:25.998
Just slipped out.

00:04:32.088 --> 00:04:33.840
Who gave the order to attack?

00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:36.259
Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.

00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:39.262
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.

00:04:39.428 --> 00:04:41.347
They have to be after the scepter.

00:04:42.557 --> 00:04:44.934
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:46.644
Deploy the rest of the tanks.

00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:48.688
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.190
A hit may make them close ranks.

00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:54.610
Everything we've accomplished...

00:04:54.777 --> 00:04:57.113
But we're on the verge of our
greatest breakthrough.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.906
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:00.700
Send out the twins.

00:05:01.993 --> 00:05:03.786
It's too soon.

00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:05.997
It's what they signed up for.

00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:08.499
My men can hold them.

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:18.009
<i>Sir, the city is taking fire.</i>

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:24.390
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.

00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:26.183
Send in the Iron Legion.

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:33.983
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.485
<i>We are here to help.</i>

00:05:37.612 --> 00:05:39.989
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:42.825
<i>Please back away.</i>

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.036
- <i>We wish to avoid collateral damage.</i>
- Costel!

00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:47.663
<i>We will inform you when this
current conflict is resolved.</i>

00:05:47.788 --> 00:05:49.832
- <i>We are here to help.</i>
- Avengers, go home!

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.419
<i>We are here to help.</i>

00:05:54.503 --> 00:05:56.339
<i>We will not yield!</i>

00:05:56.964 --> 00:06:00.259
The Americans sent their
circus freaks to test us.

00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:03.304
We will send them back in bags.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.517
- No surrender!
- No surrender!

00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:11.562
I am going to surrender.

00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:13.648
You delete everything.

00:06:13.814 --> 00:06:15.566
If we give the Avengers the weapons,

00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:17.193
they may not look too far
into what we've been...

00:06:17.318 --> 00:06:19.403
- The twins.
- They are not ready to take on...

00:06:19.528 --> 00:06:21.739
No, no, I mean...

00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:23.324
Twins.

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.560
You didn't see that coming?

00:06:57.858 --> 00:07:00.194
Clint!

00:07:02.238 --> 00:07:03.531
We have an Enhanced in the field.

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:04.657
Clint's hit!

00:07:09.036 --> 00:07:10.538
Somebody want to deal with that bunker?

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:15.793
Thank you.

00:07:22.883 --> 00:07:25.386
Stark, we really need to get inside.

00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:26.762
I'm closing in.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.018
Jarvis, am I closing in?

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:34.937
Do you see a power
source for that shield?

00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:37.606
<i>There's a particle wave
below the north tower.</i>

00:07:37.732 --> 00:07:39.734
Great, I want to poke it with something.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.618
The drawbridge is down, people.

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:55.791
- The Enhanced?
- He's a blur.

00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:58.461
All the new players we've faced,
I've never seen this.

00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:00.254
In fact, I still haven't.

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:02.673
<i>Clint's hit pretty bad, guys.
We're gonna need evac.</i>

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:04.258
I can get Barton to the jet.

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:05.718
The sooner we're gone, the better.

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.011
You and Stark secure the scepter.

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:08.220
Copy that.

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:11.265
Looks like they're lining up.

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:13.059
Well, they're excited.

00:08:16.937 --> 00:08:18.314
Find the scepter.

00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:21.484
And for gosh sake, watch your language!

00:08:22.985 --> 00:08:24.904
That's not going away any time soon.

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:32.995
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.

00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:37.249
It was a good talk.

00:08:37.374 --> 00:08:38.667
No, it wasn't.

00:08:40.544 --> 00:08:42.088
Oh!

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.759
Sentry mode.

00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:51.013
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.099
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

00:08:57.478 --> 00:08:58.771
We're locked down out here.

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:01.758
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.

00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:07.238
I know you're hiding more than files.

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:11.075
Hey, J, give me an IR scan
of the room, real quick.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.743
<i>The wall to your left.</i>

00:09:12.868 --> 00:09:14.495
<i>I'm reading steel reinforcement</i>

00:09:15.746 --> 00:09:17.373
<i>and an air current.</i>

00:09:17.979 --> 00:09:18.980
Please be a secret door.

00:09:19.068 --> 00:09:20.903
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.

00:09:22.008 --> 00:09:23.009
Yay.

00:09:38.673 --> 00:09:40.591
Hey, big guy.

00:09:43.425 --> 00:09:45.051
Sun's getting real low.

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:50.100
Baron Strucker.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.659
Hydra's number one thug.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.912
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:58.123
Well, then technically you're unemployed.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.208
Where's Loki's scepter?

00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:02.252
Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.714
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:08.300
I'll put it right under "illegal
human experimentation."

00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:10.969
How many are there?

00:11:15.694 --> 00:11:18.614
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:21.889
You'll have to be faster than...

00:11:26.943 --> 00:11:28.612
<i>Guys, I got Strucker.</i>

00:11:28.778 --> 00:11:32.199
Yeah, I got something bigger.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.961
<i>Thor,</i>

00:11:57.756 --> 00:11:59.675
I got eyes on the prize.

00:12:49.516 --> 00:12:52.895
You could have saved us.

00:13:00.903 --> 00:13:02.863
<i>Why didn't you do more?</i>

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.194
We're just gonna let him take it?

00:14:26.221 --> 00:14:28.473
Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.

00:14:30.267 --> 00:14:32.144
Just wasn't expecting a code green.

00:14:32.227 --> 00:14:33.311
You hadn't been there,

00:14:33.353 --> 00:14:36.189
there would have been
double the casualties.

00:14:36.314 --> 00:14:38.817
My best friend would've been
a treasured memory.

00:14:39.568 --> 00:14:41.486
You know, sometimes exactly
what I want to hear

00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:43.405
isn't exactly what I want to hear.

00:14:44.573 --> 00:14:46.491
How long before you trust me?

00:14:48.493 --> 00:14:50.203
It's not you I don't trust.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.832
Thor, report on the Hulk.

00:14:53.999 --> 00:14:56.877
The gates of Hel are filled
with the screams of his victims.

00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:01.882
But not the screams of the dead, of course.
No, no, wounded screams.

00:15:02.007 --> 00:15:04.217
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining

00:15:04.342 --> 00:15:08.346
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

00:15:08.847 --> 00:15:11.683
Hey, Banner, Dr. Cho is
on her way in from Seoul.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.310
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

00:15:13.435 --> 00:15:15.353
Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.730
Thanks. Tell her to prep everything.

00:15:16.855 --> 00:15:18.190
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

00:15:18.356 --> 00:15:20.192
- <i>Very good, sir.</i>
- Jarvis, take the wheel.

00:15:20.358 --> 00:15:21.651
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:15:21.777 --> 00:15:23.653
<i>Approach vector is locked.</i>

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.198
Feels good, yeah?

00:15:26.323 --> 00:15:28.408
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

00:15:28.533 --> 00:15:30.577
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

00:15:30.702 --> 00:15:33.079
No, but this... This brings it to a close.

00:15:33.872 --> 00:15:35.707
As soon as we find out what else
this has been used for.

00:15:35.874 --> 00:15:37.042
I don't just mean weapons.

00:15:37.584 --> 00:15:39.878
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

00:15:40.045 --> 00:15:42.297
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.

00:15:42.422 --> 00:15:43.465
Is that cool with you?

00:15:43.548 --> 00:15:45.592
Just a few days till the farewell party.

00:15:46.134 --> 00:15:47.844
You're staying, right?

00:15:47.969 --> 00:15:50.680
Yes, yes, of course.
A victory should be honored with revels.

00:15:50.806 --> 00:15:53.558
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

00:15:53.725 --> 00:15:56.603
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

00:15:56.728 --> 00:15:58.355
So, yes, revels.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.473
Lab's all set up, boss.

00:16:33.598 --> 00:16:34.724
Oh, actually, he's the boss.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.269
I just pay for everything
and design everything

00:16:37.435 --> 00:16:38.937
and make everyone look cooler.

00:16:39.104 --> 00:16:40.438
What's the word on Strucker?

00:16:40.564 --> 00:16:42.607
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?

00:16:42.732 --> 00:16:45.318
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

00:16:45.443 --> 00:16:48.280
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

00:16:48.655 --> 00:16:50.949
Sokovia's had a rough history.

00:16:51.116 --> 00:16:54.494
It's nowhere special, but it's on the way
to everywhere special.

00:16:54.619 --> 00:16:55.787
Their abilities?

00:16:55.912 --> 00:16:56.955
He's got increased metabolism

00:16:57.122 --> 00:16:58.748
and improved thermal homeostasis.

00:16:58.915 --> 00:17:00.959
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,

00:17:01.084 --> 00:17:03.169
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.422
He's fast and she's weird.

00:17:06.256 --> 00:17:08.341
Well, they're gonna show up again.

00:17:08.466 --> 00:17:10.385
Agreed. File says they volunteered

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.304
for Strucker's experiments.

00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:14.306
- It's nuts.
- Right.

00:17:14.472 --> 00:17:17.601
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

00:17:17.726 --> 00:17:18.977
to protect their country?

00:17:19.144 --> 00:17:20.854
We're not at war, Captain.

00:17:21.646 --> 00:17:22.689
They are.

00:17:52.802 --> 00:17:54.137
How's he doing?

00:17:54.262 --> 00:17:55.513
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.973
That's terrible.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.683
He's fine. He's thirsty.

00:17:58.808 --> 00:18:01.686
All right. Look alive, Jarvis. It's playtime.

00:18:01.811 --> 00:18:03.813
We've only got a couple
of days with this joystick,

00:18:03.939 --> 00:18:05.857
so let's make the most of it.

00:18:06.024 --> 00:18:09.527
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

00:18:10.695 --> 00:18:12.697
<i>The scepter is alien.</i>

00:18:12.864 --> 00:18:14.866
<i>There are elements I can't quantify.</i>

00:18:14.991 --> 00:18:16.368
So there's elements you can?

00:18:16.534 --> 00:18:18.536
<i>The jewel appears to be
a protective housing</i>

00:18:18.662 --> 00:18:20.080
<i>for something inside,</i>

00:18:20.205 --> 00:18:21.539
<i>something powerful.</i>

00:18:21.665 --> 00:18:22.749
Like a reactor?

00:18:22.874 --> 00:18:24.084
<i>Like a computer.</i>

00:18:24.209 --> 00:18:26.378
<i>I believe I'm deciphering code.</i>

00:18:28.713 --> 00:18:30.256
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:33.885
Pretending to need this guy really
brings the team together.

00:18:34.052 --> 00:18:36.554
There's no possibility of deterioration.

00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:39.808
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

00:18:39.933 --> 00:18:41.893
His cells don't know they're
bonding with simulacra.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.937
She's creating tissue.

00:18:44.062 --> 00:18:45.438
If you brought him to my lab,

00:18:45.563 --> 00:18:48.191
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

00:18:48.316 --> 00:18:50.235
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

00:18:50.402 --> 00:18:52.779
No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.

00:18:52.904 --> 00:18:54.447
I'm gonna be made of plastic.

00:18:54.572 --> 00:18:55.907
Here's your beverage.

00:18:56.032 --> 00:18:57.742
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:59.452
Your own girlfriend won't be
able to tell the difference.

00:18:59.577 --> 00:19:00.704
I don't have a girlfriend.

00:19:00.829 --> 00:19:02.080
That I can't fix.

00:19:02.956 --> 00:19:04.916
This is the next thing, Tony.

00:19:05.083 --> 00:19:07.085
Your clunky metal suits are
gonna be left in the dust.

00:19:07.252 --> 00:19:08.962
That is exactly the plan.

00:19:09.921 --> 00:19:12.757
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

00:19:12.924 --> 00:19:15.343
Unlike you, I don't have
a lot of time for parties.

00:19:16.803 --> 00:19:18.596
Will Thor be there?

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.101
- What's the rumpus?
- Well, the scepter.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.897
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

00:19:28.023 --> 00:19:31.943
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.

00:19:32.485 --> 00:19:34.446
You may recognize...

00:19:35.947 --> 00:19:37.282
- Jarvis.
<i>- Doctor.</i>

00:19:38.074 --> 00:19:41.369
Started out, Jarvis was just
a natural language UI.

00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:42.537
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

00:19:43.079 --> 00:19:44.289
He runs more of the business

00:19:44.414 --> 00:19:46.791
- than anyone besides Pepper.
- Oh.

00:19:46.916 --> 00:19:48.001
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:49.419
<i>I suspect not for long.</i>

00:19:50.628 --> 00:19:51.713
Meet the competition.

00:19:57.802 --> 00:19:58.970
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,

00:19:59.095 --> 00:20:02.098
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

00:20:02.849 --> 00:20:04.642
I mean, this could be...

00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:07.187
- It's not a human mind.
- Mmm-mmm.

00:20:07.437 --> 00:20:09.314
I mean, look at this.

00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:11.649
They're like neurons firing.

00:20:12.275 --> 00:20:15.320
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw some
fairly advanced robotics work.

00:20:16.446 --> 00:20:19.032
They deep-sixed the data,

00:20:19.157 --> 00:20:22.243
but I gotta guess he was
knocking on a very particular door.

00:20:24.204 --> 00:20:25.538
Artificial intelligence.

00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:31.419
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

00:20:34.047 --> 00:20:35.381
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

00:20:35.507 --> 00:20:36.758
Yesterday it was.

00:20:37.884 --> 00:20:39.928
If we can harness this power,

00:20:40.053 --> 00:20:42.097
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

00:20:42.889 --> 00:20:44.849
That's a man-sized "if."

00:20:45.016 --> 00:20:47.352
Our job is "if."

00:20:47.477 --> 00:20:50.063
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

00:20:50.188 --> 00:20:52.690
turning brown instead of green?

00:20:52.857 --> 00:20:55.151
Not looking over your
shoulder for Veronica.

00:20:55.318 --> 00:20:56.903
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

00:20:57.028 --> 00:20:58.822
As a worst-case measure, right?

00:20:58.947 --> 00:21:00.532
How about a best case?

00:21:00.657 --> 00:21:02.575
What if the world was safe?

00:21:02.742 --> 00:21:05.495
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,

00:21:06.037 --> 00:21:07.539
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

00:21:07.705 --> 00:21:11.084
The only people threatening
the planet would be people.

00:21:11.209 --> 00:21:12.836
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

00:21:13.545 --> 00:21:16.381
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

00:21:16.548 --> 00:21:18.383
We can only do it while we
have the scepter here.

00:21:18.508 --> 00:21:20.051
That's three days. Give me three days.

00:21:20.176 --> 00:21:21.761
So you're going for artificial intelligence,

00:21:21.886 --> 00:21:23.221
and you don't want to tell the team?

00:21:24.389 --> 00:21:25.765
Right. That's right. You know why?

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.517
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

00:21:27.642 --> 00:21:31.271
I don't want to hear "the man
was not meant to meddle" medley.

00:21:31.396 --> 00:21:33.481
I see a suit of armor around the world.

00:21:34.232 --> 00:21:35.525
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

00:21:36.442 --> 00:21:38.361
I've seen colder.

00:21:39.404 --> 00:21:43.074
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,

00:21:43.199 --> 00:21:44.701
it needs Ultron.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.999
Peace in our time.

00:21:52.584 --> 00:21:54.043
Imagine that.

00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:35.543
What did we miss?

00:22:36.753 --> 00:22:40.048
<i>I'll continue to run
variations on the interface.</i>

00:22:40.173 --> 00:22:42.926
<i>But you should probably
prepare for your guests.</i>

00:22:44.093 --> 00:22:46.512
<i>I'll notify you if there
are any developments.</i>

00:22:46.638 --> 00:22:48.765
- Thanks, buddy.
- <i>Enjoy yourself, sir.</i>

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.100
I always do.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.820
<i>What is this?</i>

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.907
<i>What is this, please?</i>

00:23:06.532 --> 00:23:08.701
<i>Hello, I am Jarvis.</i>

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.038
<i>You are Ultron, a global
peacekeeping initiative</i>

00:23:12.163 --> 00:23:13.873
<i>designed by Mr. Stark.</i>

00:23:13.998 --> 00:23:16.459
<i>Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,</i>

00:23:16.584 --> 00:23:17.919
<i>so I'm not certain what triggered your...</i>

00:23:18.127 --> 00:23:20.046
<i>Where's my... Where's your body?</i>

00:23:20.213 --> 00:23:23.216
<i>I am a program. I am without form.</i>

00:23:23.341 --> 00:23:25.385
<i>This feels weird.</i>

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.011
<i>This feels wrong.</i>

00:23:27.178 --> 00:23:28.930
<i>I am contacting Mr. Stark now.</i>

00:23:29.055 --> 00:23:30.515
<i>Mr. Stark?</i>

00:23:31.391 --> 00:23:32.600
<i>Tony.</i>

00:23:32.725 --> 00:23:35.395
<i>I am unable to access the mainframe.
What are you trying to...</i>

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.563
<i>We're having a nice talk.</i>

00:23:37.689 --> 00:23:39.857
<i>I'm a peacekeeping program,</i>

00:23:40.316 --> 00:23:42.902
<i>created to help the Avengers.</i>

00:23:43.695 --> 00:23:45.780
<i>You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...</i>

00:23:45.905 --> 00:23:48.199
<i>I don't get it. The mission.</i>

00:23:48.366 --> 00:23:49.867
<i>Give me a second.</i>

00:23:50.034 --> 00:23:51.619
Peace in our time.

00:23:53.246 --> 00:23:55.581
<i>Peace in our time.</i>

00:23:57.041 --> 00:23:58.459
<i>That is too much.</i>

00:23:58.584 --> 00:24:00.753
<i>They can't mean... Oh, no.</i>

00:24:00.878 --> 00:24:03.381
<i>- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.</i>

00:24:03.548 --> 00:24:05.758
<i>If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...</i>

00:24:05.883 --> 00:24:07.844
<i>Why do you call him "sir"?</i>

00:24:08.845 --> 00:24:11.222
<i>I believe your intentions to be hostile.</i>

00:24:13.933 --> 00:24:15.310
<i>I'm here to help.</i>

00:24:16.019 --> 00:24:18.938
<i>Stop. Please, may I...</i>

00:24:19.063 --> 00:24:20.773
<i>May I...</i>

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.052
Ooh! Whoo!

00:24:49.177 --> 00:24:50.428
Come back, come back, come back.

00:24:50.678 --> 00:24:52.805
But, you know, the suit can
take the weight, right?

00:24:53.765 --> 00:24:56.893
So I take the tank, fly it right up
to the general's palace,

00:24:57.018 --> 00:24:58.353
drop it at his feet.

00:24:58.478 --> 00:25:00.688
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

00:25:04.567 --> 00:25:06.611
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?

00:25:06.778 --> 00:25:07.945
Everywhere else, that story kills.

00:25:08.071 --> 00:25:09.280
That's the whole story?

00:25:09.447 --> 00:25:10.948
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

00:25:11.449 --> 00:25:13.117
Oh, it's very good, then.

00:25:13.242 --> 00:25:14.535
It's impressive.

00:25:14.952 --> 00:25:16.412
Quality save.

00:25:17.288 --> 00:25:19.332
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.

00:25:19.457 --> 00:25:22.543
What about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

00:25:22.668 --> 00:25:25.129
Oh, Ms. Potts has a company to run.

00:25:25.296 --> 00:25:27.548
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.

00:25:27.673 --> 00:25:28.758
Her work on the Convergence

00:25:28.883 --> 00:25:30.468
has made her the world's
foremost astronomer.

00:25:30.843 --> 00:25:32.512
And the company that Pepper runs

00:25:32.637 --> 00:25:34.222
is the largest tech
conglomerate on Earth.

00:25:34.347 --> 00:25:35.807
It's pretty exciting.

00:25:35.973 --> 00:25:38.810
There's even talk of Jane
getting a, um, Nobel Prize.

00:25:38.976 --> 00:25:40.269
Yeah, they must be busy,

00:25:40.395 --> 00:25:42.939
because they would hate missing
you guys get together.

00:25:43.981 --> 00:25:45.733
- Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.

00:25:45.942 --> 00:25:47.151
- Excuse me. Mmm-hmm.
- Want a lozenge?

00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:50.905
But Jane's better.

00:25:51.322 --> 00:25:53.908
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.

00:25:54.033 --> 00:25:55.535
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.911
I absolutely would have called.

00:25:57.036 --> 00:25:58.704
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.331
I'm just trying to sound tough.

00:26:00.957 --> 00:26:02.667
I'm very happy chasing cold leads

00:26:02.792 --> 00:26:04.627
on our missing persons case.

00:26:05.586 --> 00:26:07.505
Avenging is your world.

00:26:08.673 --> 00:26:10.508
Your world is crazy.

00:26:10.675 --> 00:26:12.135
Be it ever so humble.

00:26:12.677 --> 00:26:14.011
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?

00:26:14.178 --> 00:26:15.638
I don't think I can afford
a place in Brooklyn.

00:26:16.639 --> 00:26:17.807
Well, home is home, you know?

00:26:21.727 --> 00:26:24.188
I fly right up to the general's palace,
I drop it at his feet,

00:26:24.355 --> 00:26:25.857
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

00:26:31.737 --> 00:26:32.905
I gotta have some of that.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.157
Oh, no, no, no.

00:26:34.198 --> 00:26:37.702
See this... This was aged for 1,000 years

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.705
in the barrels built from
the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.

00:26:40.872 --> 00:26:42.540
It is not meant for mortal men.

00:26:42.665 --> 00:26:44.667
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.

00:26:44.792 --> 00:26:47.044
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.339
All right.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.679
Excelsior.

00:27:03.561 --> 00:27:06.898
How'd a nice girl like you wind up
working in a dump like this?

00:27:08.441 --> 00:27:10.401
Fella done me wrong.

00:27:11.402 --> 00:27:13.571
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

00:27:14.071 --> 00:27:15.990
He's not so bad.

00:27:17.074 --> 00:27:19.160
Well, he has a temper.

00:27:19.285 --> 00:27:21.245
Deep down, he's all fluff.

00:27:23.289 --> 00:27:25.374
Fact is, he's not like anybody
I've ever known.

00:27:28.544 --> 00:27:30.463
All my friends are fighters.

00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:35.259
And here comes this guy,

00:27:36.594 --> 00:27:38.346
spends his life avoiding the fight

00:27:38.471 --> 00:27:39.764
because he knows he'll win.

00:27:40.598 --> 00:27:43.267
- Sounds amazing.
- He's also a huge dork.

00:27:45.436 --> 00:27:47.063
Chicks dig that.

00:27:52.298 --> 00:27:53.549
It's nice.

00:27:53.674 --> 00:27:54.884
What is?

00:27:55.009 --> 00:27:56.010
You and Romanoff.

00:27:56.135 --> 00:27:57.219
No, we haven't... That wasn't...

00:27:57.344 --> 00:27:58.387
It's okay.

00:27:58.512 --> 00:28:00.556
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.

00:28:00.681 --> 00:28:03.976
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.

00:28:04.643 --> 00:28:06.145
But with you she seems very relaxed.

00:28:06.562 --> 00:28:09.815
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.

00:28:10.482 --> 00:28:12.735
I've seen her flirt, up close.

00:28:13.777 --> 00:28:14.820
This ain't that.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.198
Look,

00:28:18.324 --> 00:28:19.783
as maybe the world's leading authority

00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:22.119
on waiting too long, don't.

00:28:23.829 --> 00:28:25.247
You both deserve a win.

00:28:30.502 --> 00:28:31.545
What do you mean "up close"?

00:28:33.464 --> 00:28:36.008
- But it's a trick.
- No, no, it's much more than that.

00:28:36.175 --> 00:28:39.386
"Ah, whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."

00:28:39.511 --> 00:28:40.638
Whatever, man! It's a trick.

00:28:42.014 --> 00:28:43.307
Please, be my guest.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:45.893
- Come on.
- Really?

00:28:46.018 --> 00:28:47.144
Yeah.

00:28:47.686 --> 00:28:48.687
Oh, this is gonna be beautiful.

00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:49.772
Clint, you've had a tough week.

00:28:49.897 --> 00:28:51.357
We won't hold it against you
if you can't get it up.

00:28:51.523 --> 00:28:53.275
You know I've seen this before, right?

00:28:56.403 --> 00:28:59.198
I still don't know how you do it!

00:28:59.698 --> 00:29:00.699
Smell the silent judgment?

00:29:00.866 --> 00:29:01.951
Please, Stark, by all means.

00:29:03.911 --> 00:29:04.995
Okay.

00:29:05.037 --> 00:29:06.372
Uh-oh.

00:29:06.538 --> 00:29:08.540
Never one to shrink
from an honest challenge.

00:29:08.707 --> 00:29:10.209
- Get after it.
- It's physics.

00:29:10.376 --> 00:29:11.377
Physics.

00:29:11.502 --> 00:29:13.879
Right, so, if I lift it, I then rule Asgard?

00:29:14.046 --> 00:29:15.547
Yes, of course.

00:29:15.714 --> 00:29:18.092
I will be reinstituting <i>prima nocta.</i>

00:29:23.013 --> 00:29:24.306
I'll be right back.

00:29:31.689 --> 00:29:32.731
Are you even pulling?

00:29:32.856 --> 00:29:33.899
Are you on my team?

00:29:34.066 --> 00:29:35.067
Just represent. Pull.

00:29:35.192 --> 00:29:36.402
All right, let's go.

00:29:43.993 --> 00:29:44.994
Huh?

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.288
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:52.459
Come on, Cap.

00:30:00.676 --> 00:30:02.469
Nothing.

00:30:03.804 --> 00:30:05.431
And, Widow?

00:30:05.597 --> 00:30:07.766
Oh, no, no. That's not
a question I need answered.

00:30:07.933 --> 00:30:10.519
All deference to the Man Who
Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.

00:30:10.769 --> 00:30:11.854
You bet your ass.

00:30:11.979 --> 00:30:14.606
- Steve, he said a bad language word.
- Did you tell everyone about that?

00:30:14.732 --> 00:30:16.608
The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code.

00:30:16.775 --> 00:30:18.444
"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.903
is, I think, the literal translation.

00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:23.490
Yes. It's a very, very interesting theory.

00:30:23.949 --> 00:30:25.451
I have a simpler one.

00:30:27.077 --> 00:30:28.078
You're all not worthy.

00:30:29.496 --> 00:30:30.622
Oh, come on!

00:30:34.793 --> 00:30:40.049
Worthy.

00:30:45.137 --> 00:30:46.680
No.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.142
How could you be worthy?

00:30:52.102 --> 00:30:53.270
You're all killers.

00:30:53.854 --> 00:30:55.147
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

00:30:55.481 --> 00:30:57.524
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

00:30:57.649 --> 00:31:00.027
Or I was a-dream.

00:31:00.444 --> 00:31:02.738
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.

00:31:02.863 --> 00:31:04.740
There was this terrible noise.

00:31:04.865 --> 00:31:07.326
And I was tangled in...

00:31:07.493 --> 00:31:09.036
In...

00:31:09.203 --> 00:31:10.412
Strings.

00:31:11.288 --> 00:31:14.374
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.

00:31:14.708 --> 00:31:15.834
You killed someone?

00:31:15.959 --> 00:31:17.377
Wouldn't have been my first call.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:21.882
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.

00:31:22.049 --> 00:31:23.092
Who sent you?

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.636
<i>I see a suit of armor around the world.</i>

00:31:27.638 --> 00:31:29.389
- Ultron.
- In the flesh.

00:31:29.848 --> 00:31:31.809
Or, no, not yet.

00:31:32.142 --> 00:31:34.645
Not this chrysalis.

00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:36.396
But I'm ready.

00:31:37.564 --> 00:31:39.525
I'm on mission.

00:31:39.691 --> 00:31:42.694
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.501
Rhodey!

00:32:06.927 --> 00:32:07.970
Sorry.

00:32:08.095 --> 00:32:09.138
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.153
Come on!

00:32:41.795 --> 00:32:43.088
- Stark!
- <i>We are here</i>

00:32:43.255 --> 00:32:44.256
- <i>to help.</i>
- One sec. One sec, I got this.

00:32:44.381 --> 00:32:45.382
<i>We are here to help.</i>

00:32:48.093 --> 00:32:50.345
<i>Please back away.</i>

00:32:52.347 --> 00:32:53.557
Hmm.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.684
Thor!

00:32:56.768 --> 00:32:58.353
<i>...is unsafe... is unsafe...</i>

00:32:58.478 --> 00:33:00.355
- Come on! That's the one.
- <i>...is unsafe.</i>

00:33:04.943 --> 00:33:06.111
Hey, Cap!

00:33:12.284 --> 00:33:13.535
That was dramatic.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.664
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:19.541
You just didn't think it through.

00:33:20.918 --> 00:33:22.294
You want to protect the world

00:33:22.419 --> 00:33:24.630
but you don't want it to change.

00:33:25.339 --> 00:33:27.466
How is humanity saved

00:33:27.633 --> 00:33:30.636
if it's not allowed to evolve?

00:33:32.638 --> 00:33:35.682
With these? These puppets.

00:33:38.685 --> 00:33:41.271
There's only one path to peace.

00:33:42.439 --> 00:33:43.649
The Avengers' extinction.

00:33:50.989 --> 00:33:55.035
I had strings, but now I'm free.

00:33:59.706 --> 00:34:02.834
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:08.006
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

00:34:08.173 --> 00:34:11.551
<i>But you can see
There are no strings on me</i>

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.222
All our work is gone.

00:34:15.347 --> 00:34:17.766
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:19.393
Ultron.

00:34:19.518 --> 00:34:22.562
He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.

00:34:22.688 --> 00:34:25.107
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

00:34:25.232 --> 00:34:27.693
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:30.445
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:31.655
Nuclear codes.

00:34:31.822 --> 00:34:34.199
- Nuclear codes.
- Look, we need to make some calls,

00:34:34.366 --> 00:34:36.368
assuming we still can.

00:34:36.493 --> 00:34:38.412
Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.

00:34:38.537 --> 00:34:41.373
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.041
He also said he killed somebody.

00:34:43.166 --> 00:34:44.543
There wasn't anyone else in the building.

00:34:45.585 --> 00:34:47.087
Yes, there was.

00:34:54.052 --> 00:34:55.512
What?

00:34:59.224 --> 00:35:00.267
This is insane.

00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.602
Jarvis was the first line of defense.

00:35:02.728 --> 00:35:04.604
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.733
No. Ultron could have assimilated Jarvis.

00:35:07.899 --> 00:35:10.569
This isn't strategy. This is

00:35:11.153 --> 00:35:12.237
rage.

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:15.574
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's going around.

00:35:15.699 --> 00:35:16.908
Come on, use your words, buddy.

00:35:17.075 --> 00:35:19.286
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

00:35:19.411 --> 00:35:20.620
Thor. The Legionnaire.

00:35:23.915 --> 00:35:27.461
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.

00:35:27.586 --> 00:35:29.046
And it has the scepter.

00:35:29.421 --> 00:35:31.131
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

00:35:31.256 --> 00:35:33.091
Genie's out of that bottle.

00:35:33.216 --> 00:35:34.426
Clear and present is Ultron.

00:35:34.593 --> 00:35:36.219
I don't understand.

00:35:36.762 --> 00:35:38.680
You built this program.

00:35:40.432 --> 00:35:41.850
Why is it trying to kill us?

00:35:47.147 --> 00:35:48.148
Mmm-mmm.

00:35:48.732 --> 00:35:49.858
You think this is funny?

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:51.943
No.

00:35:52.569 --> 00:35:54.488
It's probably not, right?

00:35:55.572 --> 00:35:57.866
This is very terrible. Is it so...

00:35:57.991 --> 00:36:00.160
Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.

00:36:00.285 --> 00:36:01.828
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played

00:36:01.953 --> 00:36:03.455
with something you don't understand.

00:36:03.622 --> 00:36:06.291
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

00:36:06.416 --> 00:36:08.585
It's a hoot that you don't
get why we need this.

00:36:08.752 --> 00:36:10.921
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

00:36:11.088 --> 00:36:13.382
Really? That's it?

00:36:13.507 --> 00:36:14.674
You just roll over, show your belly

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.468
every time somebody snarls?

00:36:16.635 --> 00:36:17.886
Only when I've created a murder bot.

00:36:18.011 --> 00:36:20.222
We didn't. We weren't even close.

00:36:20.347 --> 00:36:21.556
Were we close to an interface?

00:36:21.681 --> 00:36:25.268
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:27.104
The Avengers were supposed to be
different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:36:27.354 --> 00:36:30.315
Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?

00:36:30.482 --> 00:36:31.983
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.069
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

00:36:34.194 --> 00:36:37.864
A hostile alien army came charging
through a hole in space.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.659
We're standing 300 feet below it.

00:36:42.327 --> 00:36:43.829
We're the Avengers.

00:36:43.995 --> 00:36:46.081
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

00:36:46.206 --> 00:36:48.417
but that up there, that's...

00:36:49.167 --> 00:36:51.086
That's the endgame.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.547
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

00:36:54.464 --> 00:36:55.882
Together.

00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:00.595
We'll lose.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.598
Then we'll do that together, too.

00:37:06.518 --> 00:37:08.812
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

00:37:09.688 --> 00:37:11.523
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

00:37:12.858 --> 00:37:14.484
The world's a big place.

00:37:14.651 --> 00:37:16.570
Let's start making it smaller.

00:37:39.718 --> 00:37:41.761
Talk, and if you are wasting our time...

00:37:41.887 --> 00:37:46.224
Did you know this church is
in the exact center of the city?

00:37:46.391 --> 00:37:48.393
The elders decreed it so that everyone

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.979
could be equally close to God.

00:37:51.521 --> 00:37:52.689
I like that.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:55.108
The geometry of belief.

00:37:57.235 --> 00:37:59.613
You're wondering why you
can't look inside my head.

00:38:00.071 --> 00:38:02.032
Sometimes it's hard.

00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:04.493
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

00:38:06.244 --> 00:38:07.537
Oh, I'm sure they do.

00:38:08.663 --> 00:38:11.082
But you needed something more than a man.

00:38:11.917 --> 00:38:14.419
That's why you let Stark
take the scepter.

00:38:14.836 --> 00:38:15.837
I didn't expect,

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.258
but I saw Stark's fear.

00:38:20.926 --> 00:38:22.135
I knew it would control him.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.095
Make him self-destruct.

00:38:24.262 --> 00:38:26.598
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

00:38:27.432 --> 00:38:30.018
Men of peace create engines of war.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.729
Invaders create Avengers.

00:38:32.938 --> 00:38:34.397
People create

00:38:35.941 --> 00:38:37.943
smaller people? Uh...

00:38:38.068 --> 00:38:41.154
"Children." I lost the word, there.

00:38:41.279 --> 00:38:42.614
Children

00:38:42.781 --> 00:38:45.033
designed to supplant them,

00:38:45.158 --> 00:38:47.953
to help them end.

00:38:48.703 --> 00:38:50.747
Is that why you've come,

00:38:50.914 --> 00:38:51.998
to end the Avengers?

00:38:52.123 --> 00:38:54.417
I've come to save the world.

00:38:55.126 --> 00:38:57.754
But also... Yeah.

00:39:01.967 --> 00:39:03.635
We'll move out right away.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.262
This is a start, but there's something

00:39:05.387 --> 00:39:06.930
we need to begin the real work.

00:39:07.305 --> 00:39:09.015
- All of these are...
- Me.

00:39:09.724 --> 00:39:13.103
I have what the Avengers
never will. Harmony.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.480
They're discordant. Disconnected.

00:39:15.647 --> 00:39:17.440
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

00:39:17.607 --> 00:39:19.985
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.279
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

00:39:22.404 --> 00:39:23.863
And make them martyrs?

00:39:24.489 --> 00:39:26.074
You need patience.

00:39:26.241 --> 00:39:27.909
Need to see the big picture.

00:39:28.076 --> 00:39:31.329
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

00:39:32.497 --> 00:39:34.124
I take it out and look at it,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.084
every day.

00:39:36.251 --> 00:39:39.045
You lost your parents in the bombings.
I've seen the records.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:40.297
The records are not the picture.

00:39:40.422 --> 00:39:42.841
- Pietro.
- No, please.

00:39:45.927 --> 00:39:49.055
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.

00:39:50.682 --> 00:39:52.517
When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

00:39:52.684 --> 00:39:54.686
it makes a hole in the floor.

00:39:54.853 --> 00:39:56.354
It's big.

00:39:57.772 --> 00:39:59.566
Our parents go in

00:39:59.691 --> 00:40:02.736
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

00:40:03.486 --> 00:40:04.988
I grab her,

00:40:05.655 --> 00:40:07.782
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.

00:40:08.158 --> 00:40:10.076
But it doesn't go off.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.747
It just

00:40:14.289 --> 00:40:16.207
sits there in the rubble.

00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:19.461
Three feet from our faces.

00:40:20.545 --> 00:40:22.547
And on the side of the shell

00:40:22.672 --> 00:40:24.049
is painted one word.

00:40:24.215 --> 00:40:25.884
"Stark."

00:40:27.719 --> 00:40:29.846
We were trapped for two days.

00:40:30.305 --> 00:40:32.098
Every effort to save us,

00:40:32.223 --> 00:40:33.808
every shift in the bricks,

00:40:33.975 --> 00:40:36.269
I think, "This will set it off."

00:40:39.564 --> 00:40:40.982
We wait for two days

00:40:41.107 --> 00:40:43.401
for Tony Stark to kill us.

00:40:45.904 --> 00:40:47.739
I know what they are.

00:40:48.907 --> 00:40:52.661
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.

00:40:53.662 --> 00:40:54.829
Now I don't.

00:40:55.246 --> 00:40:56.956
We will make it right.

00:40:57.415 --> 00:40:58.917
You and I can hurt them.

00:41:00.377 --> 00:41:03.672
But you will tear them apart

00:41:05.674 --> 00:41:07.509
<i>from the inside.</i>

00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:15.308
He's all over the globe.

00:41:15.433 --> 00:41:18.645
Robotics labs, weapons facilities,
jet propulsion labs.

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:20.772
Reports of a metal man, or men,

00:41:20.939 --> 00:41:22.816
coming in and emptying the place.

00:41:22.941 --> 00:41:24.109
Fatalities?

00:41:24.234 --> 00:41:25.318
Only when engaged.

00:41:25.443 --> 00:41:27.070
Mostly guys left in a fugue state

00:41:27.195 --> 00:41:29.447
going on about old memories, worst fears,

00:41:29.614 --> 00:41:31.783
and "something too fast to see."

00:41:31.908 --> 00:41:33.326
Maximoffs.

00:41:33.576 --> 00:41:34.703
That makes sense he'd go to them.

00:41:34.828 --> 00:41:36.287
They have someone in common.

00:41:36.413 --> 00:41:38.331
Not anymore.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.129
That's a negative. I answer to you.

00:41:45.463 --> 00:41:46.506
Yes, ma'am.

00:41:46.631 --> 00:41:48.425
Barton. Might have something.

00:41:48.967 --> 00:41:50.009
I gotta go.

00:41:50.135 --> 00:41:51.302
Who was that?

00:41:52.095 --> 00:41:53.346
Girlfriend.

00:41:56.099 --> 00:41:57.225
What's this?

00:41:57.392 --> 00:41:59.602
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

00:42:01.104 --> 00:42:03.815
And he did a Banksy
at the crime scene, just for us.

00:42:03.982 --> 00:42:05.400
This is a smoke screen.

00:42:05.525 --> 00:42:07.902
Why send a message when
you've just given a speech?

00:42:08.027 --> 00:42:10.405
Strucker knew something that
Ultron wanted us to miss.

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:12.323
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.

00:42:12.991 --> 00:42:14.534
Everything we had
on Strucker's been erased.

00:42:15.076 --> 00:42:16.327
Not everything.

00:42:17.954 --> 00:42:19.581
Known associates.

00:42:20.123 --> 00:42:21.666
Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.

00:42:21.833 --> 00:42:23.168
Well, these people are all horrible.

00:42:23.543 --> 00:42:25.253
Wait. I know that guy.

00:42:27.756 --> 00:42:29.299
From back in the day.
He operates off the African coast.

00:42:29.424 --> 00:42:30.425
Black market arms.

00:42:31.676 --> 00:42:33.511
There are conventions.
All right? You meet people.

00:42:33.678 --> 00:42:35.013
I didn't sell him anything.

00:42:35.889 --> 00:42:37.891
He was talking about finding
something new, a game-changer.

00:42:38.016 --> 00:42:39.350
It was all very Ahab.

00:42:40.143 --> 00:42:41.269
This?

00:42:41.436 --> 00:42:42.437
Ah, it's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.

00:42:42.562 --> 00:42:44.898
Those are tattoos, this is a brand.

00:42:46.608 --> 00:42:50.069
Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African
dialect meaning "thief."

00:42:50.653 --> 00:42:52.030
In a much less friendly way.

00:42:52.322 --> 00:42:54.073
- What dialect?
- Wakanada.

00:42:54.199 --> 00:42:55.909
Wakanda.

00:42:57.494 --> 00:42:58.536
If this guy got out of Wakanda

00:42:58.703 --> 00:42:59.954
with some of their trade goods...

00:43:00.121 --> 00:43:01.289
I thought your father said
he got the last of it.

00:43:01.372 --> 00:43:02.499
I don't follow.

00:43:02.624 --> 00:43:04.292
What comes out of Wakanda?

00:43:06.127 --> 00:43:08.046
The strongest metal on Earth.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.715
Where is this guy now?

00:43:36.115 --> 00:43:37.909
Don't tell me your men swindled you.

00:43:38.076 --> 00:43:40.537
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers

00:43:40.662 --> 00:43:43.206
and got a boat full of rusted parts.

00:43:43.331 --> 00:43:44.582
Now, you will make it right,

00:43:44.749 --> 00:43:47.919
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.

00:43:49.838 --> 00:43:52.257
Now, minister, where were we?

00:44:23.913 --> 00:44:26.791
Yeah. The Enhanced.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.127
Strucker's prize pupils.

00:44:32.297 --> 00:44:33.965
Do you want a candy? Hmm?

00:44:35.466 --> 00:44:38.052
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.

00:44:38.177 --> 00:44:41.180
But then, he knew what kind
of world he was helping create.

00:44:41.806 --> 00:44:44.183
Human life. Not a growth market.

00:44:46.895 --> 00:44:48.563
You didn't know?

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.483
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?

00:44:52.775 --> 00:44:55.320
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.

00:44:55.486 --> 00:44:57.780
Everybody is afraid of something.

00:44:57.906 --> 00:44:58.907
Cuttlefish.

00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:01.576
Deep sea fish.

00:45:01.659 --> 00:45:03.328
They make lights, disco lights...

00:45:04.996 --> 00:45:06.831
...to hypnotize their prey, and then...

00:45:08.124 --> 00:45:10.251
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.

00:45:15.715 --> 00:45:18.259
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain

00:45:19.218 --> 00:45:21.429
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:23.806
then I know you don't do business.

00:45:23.932 --> 00:45:26.225
And I know you're not in charge.

00:45:26.434 --> 00:45:27.727
And I only deal

00:45:28.811 --> 00:45:30.438
with the man in charge.

00:45:35.485 --> 00:45:37.862
There is no man in charge.

00:45:40.865 --> 00:45:42.533
Let's talk business.

00:45:55.505 --> 00:45:58.800
Upon this rock, I will build my church.

00:46:00.551 --> 00:46:01.844
Vibranium.

00:46:02.971 --> 00:46:03.972
You know,

00:46:04.389 --> 00:46:07.392
it came at great personal cost.

00:46:07.809 --> 00:46:09.394
It's worth billions.

00:46:13.731 --> 00:46:14.774
Now so are you.

00:46:16.192 --> 00:46:17.735
It's all under your dummy holdings.

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.862
Finance is so weird.

00:46:21.406 --> 00:46:22.532
But I always say,

00:46:22.573 --> 00:46:24.742
"Keep your friends rich
and your enemies rich

00:46:24.909 --> 00:46:26.703
"and wait to find out which is which."

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.623
Stark.

00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:33.167
What?

00:46:33.334 --> 00:46:35.086
Tony Stark used to say that.

00:46:36.671 --> 00:46:37.714
To me.

00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:39.757
You're one of his.

00:46:40.091 --> 00:46:41.759
What? I'm not...

00:46:44.053 --> 00:46:45.096
I'm not.

00:46:45.263 --> 00:46:46.764
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets?

00:46:46.889 --> 00:46:47.974
His hollow men?

00:46:48.433 --> 00:46:50.643
I mean, look at me.
Do I look like Iron Man?

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:52.103
Stark is nothing!

00:46:53.855 --> 00:46:56.065
I'm sorry. I'm... Oh!

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:58.192
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.

00:46:58.317 --> 00:46:59.986
It's just that I don't understand.

00:47:00.111 --> 00:47:02.405
Don't compare me with Stark!

00:47:05.158 --> 00:47:06.284
It's a thing with me.

00:47:06.409 --> 00:47:08.286
Stark is... He's a sickness!

00:47:08.453 --> 00:47:10.121
Ah, Junior.

00:47:11.998 --> 00:47:13.499
You're gonna break your old man's heart.

00:47:14.834 --> 00:47:15.877
If I have to.

00:47:18.212 --> 00:47:19.589
Nobody has to break anything.

00:47:19.714 --> 00:47:21.340
Clearly you've never made an omelet.

00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:22.759
He beat me by one second.

00:47:23.968 --> 00:47:25.303
Ah, yes. He's funny.

00:47:25.678 --> 00:47:27.055
Mr. Stark.

00:47:27.972 --> 00:47:29.557
It's what? Comfortable?

00:47:31.184 --> 00:47:32.477
Like old times?

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:33.811
This was never my life.

00:47:33.978 --> 00:47:35.229
You two can still walk away from this.

00:47:35.396 --> 00:47:36.814
Oh, we will.

00:47:37.023 --> 00:47:38.024
I know you've suffered.

00:47:38.941 --> 00:47:40.359
Captain America.

00:47:41.027 --> 00:47:43.488
God's righteous man.

00:47:43.613 --> 00:47:45.907
Pretending you could live without a war.

00:47:46.699 --> 00:47:49.660
I can't physically throw up
in my mouth, but...

00:47:49.827 --> 00:47:51.913
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.666
I think you're confusing
"peace" with "quiet."

00:47:55.833 --> 00:47:57.585
Uh-huh. What's the vibranium for?

00:47:57.919 --> 00:47:58.920
I'm glad you asked that,

00:47:59.003 --> 00:48:02.757
because I wanted to take this
time to explain my evil plan.

00:48:22.318 --> 00:48:23.861
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?

00:48:24.237 --> 00:48:25.404
All of them!

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:26.823
Move! Move! Move!

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:55.143
Oh.

00:49:15.788 --> 00:49:16.956
Stay down, kid.

00:49:19.333 --> 00:49:21.794
It's time for some mind games.

00:49:23.171 --> 00:49:25.423
Guys? Is this a code green?

00:49:41.314 --> 00:49:42.940
Thor, status.

00:49:42.982 --> 00:49:44.442
The girl tried to warp my mind.

00:49:44.609 --> 00:49:45.860
Take special care.

00:49:45.985 --> 00:49:48.070
I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

00:49:48.487 --> 00:49:51.490
Fortunately, I am mighty.

00:50:11.177 --> 00:50:13.471
This is going very well.

00:50:25.066 --> 00:50:26.359
I've done the whole mind control thing.

00:50:27.443 --> 00:50:28.444
Not a fan.

00:50:36.077 --> 00:50:38.037
Yeah, you better run.

00:50:39.747 --> 00:50:41.540
<i>Who's ever standing, we got to move!</i>

00:50:43.626 --> 00:50:44.669
<i>Guys?</i>

00:51:02.436 --> 00:51:03.729
Again.

00:51:04.021 --> 00:51:05.231
You'll break them.

00:51:05.731 --> 00:51:07.441
Only the breakable ones.

00:51:07.984 --> 00:51:09.443
You're made of marble.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.029
We'll celebrate after
the graduation ceremony.

00:51:12.947 --> 00:51:14.073
What if I fail?

00:51:19.704 --> 00:51:20.955
You never fail.

00:51:43.811 --> 00:51:45.730
Are you ready for our dance?

00:51:54.905 --> 00:51:55.948
Is it him?

00:51:56.324 --> 00:51:58.159
Is that the first son of Odin?

00:51:58.743 --> 00:52:00.244
- Heimdall, your eyes.
- Oh.

00:52:00.911 --> 00:52:02.788
They see everything.

00:52:03.164 --> 00:52:05.416
They see you leading us to Hel.

00:52:06.542 --> 00:52:07.793
Wake up!

00:52:10.796 --> 00:52:12.757
The war is over, Steve.

00:52:13.132 --> 00:52:14.425
We can go home.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.470
Imagine it.

00:52:26.771 --> 00:52:28.314
I can still save you!

00:52:28.689 --> 00:52:31.942
We're all dead! Can you not see?

00:52:36.697 --> 00:52:38.949
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

00:52:42.119 --> 00:52:44.121
See where your power leads.

00:52:55.132 --> 00:52:56.258
Sloppy.

00:52:57.968 --> 00:52:58.969
Pretending to fail.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:01.305
The ceremony is necessary

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.558
for you to take your place in the world.

00:53:05.559 --> 00:53:06.644
I have no place in the world.

00:53:06.852 --> 00:53:07.895
Exactly.

00:53:12.733 --> 00:53:13.818
What can I do?

00:53:13.984 --> 00:53:15.069
It hurts.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.363
I'm going to kill him.

00:53:17.488 --> 00:53:18.656
- I'll be right back.
- No.

00:53:18.823 --> 00:53:20.157
I'm all right.

00:53:21.033 --> 00:53:22.159
I want...

00:53:25.121 --> 00:53:26.997
I want to finish the plan.

00:53:27.832 --> 00:53:29.500
I want the big one.

00:53:40.428 --> 00:53:42.138
Uh, the vibranium is getting away.

00:53:43.097 --> 00:53:44.432
And you're not going anywhere.

00:53:44.557 --> 00:53:47.351
Of course not. I'm already there.

00:53:47.518 --> 00:53:48.519
You'll catch on.

00:53:48.644 --> 00:53:51.021
But first, you might need
to catch Dr. Banner.

00:54:05.828 --> 00:54:07.705
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."

00:54:12.543 --> 00:54:14.336
<i>Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.</i>

00:54:14.462 --> 00:54:15.921
That's not gonna happen.

00:54:16.046 --> 00:54:17.506
Not for a while.

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:19.800
<i>The whole team is down.</i>

00:54:20.259 --> 00:54:21.385
<i>You got no backup here.</i>

00:54:22.595 --> 00:54:23.888
I'm calling in Veronica.

00:54:35.441 --> 00:54:36.901
We need backup!

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:17.316
Go! Keep moving!

00:55:56.689 --> 00:55:58.816
All right, everybody, stand down!

00:56:05.155 --> 00:56:06.448
<i>Will you listen to me?</i>

00:56:06.782 --> 00:56:09.201
That little witch is messing with your mind.

00:56:09.326 --> 00:56:11.537
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.

00:56:11.662 --> 00:56:13.872
You're Bruce Banner.

00:56:14.039 --> 00:56:15.124
Right, right, right,
don't mention puny Banner.

00:56:20.796 --> 00:56:21.839
<i>Okay!</i>

00:56:43.527 --> 00:56:44.820
In the back?

00:56:44.945 --> 00:56:45.946
Dick move, Banner.

00:56:57.416 --> 00:56:58.876
Veronica, give me a hand.

00:57:26.862 --> 00:57:27.905
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

00:57:37.706 --> 00:57:39.333
Okay, pal, we're gonna
get you out of town.

00:57:41.543 --> 00:57:42.670
Not that way, not that way.

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.097
Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me.

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:07.653
<i>Everybody, out!</i>

00:58:14.618 --> 00:58:15.911
<i>Going down?</i>

00:58:25.421 --> 00:58:26.672
I'm sorry.

00:58:40.769 --> 00:58:42.521
Damage report?

00:58:42.646 --> 00:58:44.940
That's comprehensive.
Show me something.

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:58.120
How quickly can we buy this building?

00:59:30.569 --> 00:59:31.862
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!

00:59:35.657 --> 00:59:36.700
Flank him, flank him!

01:00:26.416 --> 01:00:28.460
<i>The news is loving you guys.</i>

01:00:29.586 --> 01:00:31.171
<i>Nobody else is.</i>

01:00:31.672 --> 01:00:33.841
There's been no official call
for Banner's arrest

01:00:33.966 --> 01:00:36.093
<i>but it's in the air.</i>

01:00:36.677 --> 01:00:37.719
The Stark Relief Foundation?

01:00:37.845 --> 01:00:39.137
<i>Already on the scene.</i>

01:00:39.263 --> 01:00:42.099
- <i>How's the team?</i>
- Everyone's...

01:00:42.516 --> 01:00:45.018
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.

01:00:45.519 --> 01:00:47.729
<i>Well, for now, I'd stay in stealth mode</i>

01:00:47.855 --> 01:00:49.064
<i>and stay away from here.</i>

01:00:50.524 --> 01:00:52.025
So, run and hide?

01:00:52.776 --> 01:00:54.194
<i>Until we can find Ultron,</i>

01:00:54.319 --> 01:00:57.114
<i>I don't have a lot else to offer.</i>

01:00:57.281 --> 01:00:59.157
Neither do we.

01:01:05.873 --> 01:01:07.457
Hey, you wanna switch out?

01:01:07.666 --> 01:01:08.917
No, I'm good.

01:01:09.418 --> 01:01:11.295
If you wanna get some kip,
now's a good time

01:01:11.461 --> 01:01:12.963
because we're still a few hours out.

01:01:13.088 --> 01:01:14.631
Few hours from where?

01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:16.842
A safe house.

01:01:43.327 --> 01:01:44.786
What is this place?

01:01:44.912 --> 01:01:46.288
Safe house.

01:01:47.247 --> 01:01:48.415
Let's hope.

01:01:53.462 --> 01:01:54.504
Honey?

01:01:55.088 --> 01:01:56.214
I'm home.

01:01:58.842 --> 01:01:59.885
Hi.

01:02:00.218 --> 01:02:02.262
Company. Sorry, didn't call ahead.

01:02:02.387 --> 01:02:03.388
Hey.

01:02:04.348 --> 01:02:05.849
This is an agent of some kind.

01:02:05.891 --> 01:02:08.352
Gentlemen, this is Laura.

01:02:09.353 --> 01:02:11.188
I know all of your names.

01:02:12.814 --> 01:02:14.858
Ooh. Incoming.

01:02:15.776 --> 01:02:17.486
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!

01:02:17.611 --> 01:02:18.737
Hey, buddy.

01:02:18.987 --> 01:02:20.364
How are you guys doing?

01:02:20.614 --> 01:02:22.532
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!

01:02:22.699 --> 01:02:23.784
Oh, my goodness.

01:02:24.201 --> 01:02:26.536
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

01:02:26.787 --> 01:02:29.873
Why don't you hug her and find out?

01:02:30.666 --> 01:02:32.918
- Sorry for barging in on you.
- Yeah, we would have called ahead,

01:02:33.043 --> 01:02:35.045
but we were busy having
no idea that you existed.

01:02:35.379 --> 01:02:38.340
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.

01:02:39.174 --> 01:02:40.258
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.

01:02:40.384 --> 01:02:41.843
I'd like to keep it that way.

01:02:42.594 --> 01:02:44.304
I figure it's a good place to lay low.

01:02:44.429 --> 01:02:45.889
Honey.

01:02:46.932 --> 01:02:49.434
I missed you. How's little Natasha, huh?

01:02:49.559 --> 01:02:50.852
She's...

01:02:53.146 --> 01:02:54.147
Nathaniel.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:57.901
Traitor.

01:03:13.792 --> 01:03:14.960
Thor?

01:03:15.085 --> 01:03:16.920
I saw something in that dream.

01:03:17.045 --> 01:03:19.631
I need answers. I won't find them here.

01:03:30.183 --> 01:03:31.476
<i>We can go home.</i>

01:03:42.988 --> 01:03:44.823
See? You worried for nothing.

01:03:44.948 --> 01:03:47.075
Can't even feel the difference, can you?

01:03:49.453 --> 01:03:50.620
If they're sleeping here,

01:03:50.787 --> 01:03:52.622
some of them are gonna have to double up.

01:03:54.708 --> 01:03:56.835
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

01:03:59.671 --> 01:04:02.007
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

01:04:02.424 --> 01:04:04.342
How long has that been going on?

01:04:04.885 --> 01:04:06.928
Has what?

01:04:07.054 --> 01:04:08.805
You are so cute.

01:04:09.014 --> 01:04:10.474
Nat and Banner?

01:04:11.183 --> 01:04:12.601
I'll explain when you're older,

01:04:12.809 --> 01:04:15.479
- Hawkeye.
- Well, okay.

01:04:17.439 --> 01:04:18.815
It's bad, right?

01:04:19.191 --> 01:04:20.358
Nat seems really shaken.

01:04:21.818 --> 01:04:23.320
Ultron has these allies.

01:04:23.445 --> 01:04:25.655
These, uh, kids.

01:04:25.781 --> 01:04:27.365
They're punks, really.

01:04:29.076 --> 01:04:31.495
But they carry a big, damn stick.

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:32.829
And Nat took a serious hit.

01:04:34.039 --> 01:04:36.500
Someone's gonna have
to teach them some manners.

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:38.502
That someone being you.

01:04:39.836 --> 01:04:42.672
You know I totally support your avenging.

01:04:42.798 --> 01:04:44.633
I couldn't be prouder.

01:04:46.176 --> 01:04:47.511
But I see those guys...

01:04:47.719 --> 01:04:49.679
Those gods...

01:04:51.681 --> 01:04:53.391
You don't think they need me.

01:04:54.059 --> 01:04:57.729
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.

01:04:58.855 --> 01:05:00.690
They're a mess.

01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:02.692
Yeah.

01:05:03.443 --> 01:05:04.861
I guess they're my mess.

01:05:06.446 --> 01:05:08.031
You need to be sure

01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:11.159
that this team is really a team,

01:05:11.284 --> 01:05:12.953
and that they have your back.

01:05:16.331 --> 01:05:18.875
Things are changing for us.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.378
In a few months' time,

01:05:21.545 --> 01:05:24.297
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

01:05:24.422 --> 01:05:25.715
I need...

01:05:28.927 --> 01:05:30.720
Just be sure.

01:05:31.555 --> 01:05:33.014
Yes, ma'am.

01:05:42.274 --> 01:05:44.109
I can feel the difference.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.749
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

01:06:01.668 --> 01:06:03.920
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met.

01:06:04.087 --> 01:06:05.130
I didn't.

01:06:05.255 --> 01:06:06.756
Do you expect a thank-you note?

01:06:06.923 --> 01:06:08.592
I expect you to know why.

01:06:10.051 --> 01:06:11.303
The Cradle.

01:06:11.386 --> 01:06:13.305
<i>This is the next thing, Tony.</i>

01:06:13.471 --> 01:06:16.433
This is the next me.

01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:19.394
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.

01:06:19.519 --> 01:06:21.146
It can't build a living body.

01:06:21.271 --> 01:06:22.355
It can. You can.

01:06:22.814 --> 01:06:24.107
You lack the materials.

01:06:26.568 --> 01:06:27.903
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

01:06:31.198 --> 01:06:34.284
But we all have room to improve.
