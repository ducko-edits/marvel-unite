00:00:14.902 --> 00:00:16.004
<i>Once…</i>

00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:19.869
<i>mankind accepted a simple truth…</i>

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.179
<i>that they were not alone
in this universe.</i>

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.106
<i>Some worlds man believed
to be home to their gods.</i>

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:33.702
<i>Others, they knew to fear.</i>

00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:41.321
<i>From a realm of cold and darkness
came the Frost Giants…</i>

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.587
<i>threatening to plunge the mortal world
into a new ice age.</i>

00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:07.058
<i>But humanity…</i>

00:01:07.164 --> 00:01:10.279
<i>would not face this threat alone.</i>

00:01:46.432 --> 00:01:51.193
<i>Our armies drove the Frost Giants
back into the heart of their own world.</i>

00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:56.824
<i>The cost was great.</i>

00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:58.788
<i>In the end…</i>

00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:01.041
<i>their king fell.</i>

00:02:05.783 --> 00:02:08.793
<i>And the source of their power
was taken from them.</i>

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.083
<i>With the last great war ended…</i>

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:14.439
<i>we withdrew from the other worlds…</i>

00:02:14.522 --> 00:02:16.139
<i>and returned home…</i>

00:02:16.587 --> 00:02:18.688
<i>to the Realm Eternal…</i>

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.561
<i>Asgard</i>

00:02:53.332 --> 00:02:56.351
<i>Here we remain as a beacon of hope…</i>

00:02:57.127 --> 00:02:59.846
<i>shining out across the stars.</i>

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:04.651
<i>And though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends…</i>

00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:07.319
<i>it was Asgard…</i>

00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:09.781
<i>and its warriors…</i>

00:03:10.443 --> 00:03:11.973
<i>that brought peace…</i>

00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:13.955
to the universe.

00:03:17.527 --> 00:03:20.088
But the day will come…

00:03:21.578 --> 00:03:23.119
when one of you…

00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:26.130
will have to defend that peace.

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:29.046
Do the Frost Giants still live?

00:03:29.138 --> 00:03:30.537
When I'm king…

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:34.263
I'll hunt the monsters down
and slay them all!

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:37.159
Just as you did, Father.

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:39.030
A wise king…

00:03:39.378 --> 00:03:42.175
never seeks out war.

00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:43.736
But…

00:03:48.477 --> 00:03:50.518
he must always be ready for it.

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:03.634
<i>I'm ready, Father.</i>

00:04:03.717 --> 00:04:05.046
<i>So am I.</i>

00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:08.931
<i>Only one of you can ascend
to the throne.</i>

00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:10.319
<i>But both of you…</i>

00:04:10.402 --> 00:04:12.854
<i>were born to be kings.</i>

00:04:46.196 --> 00:04:48.411
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.794
Pepper, slow down.

00:04:49.965 --> 00:04:51.595
Why would Obadiah...

00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:53.704
Ok, where's Tony now?

00:04:53.787 --> 00:04:55.497
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.791
Please go over there and
make sure everything's ok.

00:04:57.874 --> 00:05:00.802
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.

00:06:06.735 --> 00:06:08.035
Good boy.

00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:52.182
As you can see…

00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:55.269
production of the Valkyrie
is progressing on schedule…

00:06:55.352 --> 00:06:57.714
even with components of this size.

00:06:58.146 --> 00:07:00.992
Increase the output by 60%…

00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:04.800
and see to it our other facilities
do the same.

00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:06.076
But…

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:07.613
these prisoners I…

00:07:07.696 --> 00:07:09.895
I am not sure they have the strength.

00:07:09.978 --> 00:07:12.931
Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.

00:07:13.573 --> 00:07:16.372
There are always more workers.

00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:19.798
Not now.

00:07:34.786 --> 00:07:36.691
You know, Fritz…

00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:40.285
one of these days,
I am going to have a stick of my own.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.391
Fellas.

00:09:34.729 --> 00:09:36.497
Oh, please.

00:10:33.006 --> 00:10:34.128
Thor...

00:10:34.931 --> 00:10:36.366
Odinson…

00:10:38.323 --> 00:10:39.624
my heir…

00:10:42.374 --> 00:10:44.156
my firstborn.

00:10:45.393 --> 00:10:49.776
So long entrusted with
the mighty hammer Mjolnir…

00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:52.453
forged in the heart of a…

00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:53.961
dying star…

00:10:54.545 --> 00:10:56.683
its power has no equal…

00:10:57.186 --> 00:10:59.046
as a weapon to destroy…

00:11:00.215 --> 00:11:02.092
or as a tool to build.

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:05.228
It is a fit companion for a king.

00:11:07.164 --> 00:11:09.557
I have defended Asgard…

00:11:09.994 --> 00:11:13.168
and the lives of the innocent
across the Nine Realms…

00:11:13.828 --> 00:11:16.307
from the time of the great beginning.

00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:18.841
Though the day has come...

00:11:44.984 --> 00:11:48.232
Do you swear to guard
the Nine Realms?

00:11:48.572 --> 00:11:49.531
I swear.

00:11:49.614 --> 00:11:53.182
And do you swear
to preserve the peace?

00:11:53.274 --> 00:11:54.536
I swear.

00:11:54.619 --> 00:11:56.394
Do you swear…

00:11:57.743 --> 00:12:00.318
to cast aside all selfish ambition…

00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:03.192
and to pledge yourself only
to the good of the Realms?

00:12:03.275 --> 00:12:04.566
I swear!

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:06.342
Then, on this day…

00:12:07.048 --> 00:12:09.829
I Odin Allfather…

00:12:11.219 --> 00:12:12.786
proclaim you...

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.077
The Frost Giants!

00:13:12.905 --> 00:13:14.908
The Jotuns must pay
for what they've done!

00:13:14.991 --> 00:13:17.342
They have paid, with their lives.

00:13:18.494 --> 00:13:20.640
The Destroyer did its work…

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.082
the Casket is safe and all is well.

00:13:23.165 --> 00:13:24.466
All is Well?

00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:27.712
They broke into the weapons vault!

00:13:27.795 --> 00:13:30.427
If the Frost Giants had stolen
even one of these relics...

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.150
They didn't.
Well, I want to know why?

00:13:35.622 --> 00:13:37.889
I have a truce with Laufey,
King of the Jotuns.

00:13:37.972 --> 00:13:39.887
He just broke your truce!

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.292
They know you are vulnerable!

00:13:43.046 --> 00:13:44.437
What action would you take?

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.521
March into Jotunheim
as you once did.

00:13:46.884 --> 00:13:48.359
Teach them a lesson.

00:13:48.517 --> 00:13:51.611
Break their spirits so they'll never
dare try to cross our borders again.

00:13:51.694 --> 00:13:53.056
You're thinking only as a warrior.

00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:54.322
This was an act of war!

00:13:54.405 --> 00:13:56.658
It was the act of but a few,
doomed to fail.

00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:58.162
Look how far they got!

00:13:58.245 --> 00:14:00.900
We will find the breach in our defenses
and it will be sealed.

00:14:00.983 --> 00:14:02.256
As King of Asgard...

00:14:02.339 --> 00:14:04.230
But you're not king!

00:14:08.105 --> 00:14:09.248
Not yet.

00:14:20.898 --> 00:14:22.198
Tony?

00:14:24.651 --> 00:14:25.951
Tony?

00:14:27.529 --> 00:14:28.829
Tony?

00:14:30.776 --> 00:14:31.997
Tony?

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.780
Tony!

00:14:37.873 --> 00:14:38.873
Tony!

00:14:39.226 --> 00:14:40.238
You ok?

00:14:40.542 --> 00:14:41.924
Where's Pepper?

00:14:42.294 --> 00:14:44.130
She's fine.
She's with five agents.

00:14:44.213 --> 00:14:46.057
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

00:14:46.645 --> 00:14:48.298
That's not going to be enough.

00:15:12.574 --> 00:15:14.250
Section 16.

00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:17.100
Section 16.

00:15:17.715 --> 00:15:19.211
There it is.

00:15:27.589 --> 00:15:30.070
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:32.595
What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

00:15:32.678 --> 00:15:34.057
It's, like, a thing that's
going to pick the lock?

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.880
You might want to take
a few steps back.

00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:57.995
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

00:15:58.078 --> 00:15:59.205
Not bad, huh?

00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:00.991
Let's do it.

00:16:07.546 --> 00:16:09.550
You need me to do anything else?

00:16:10.507 --> 00:16:12.151
<i>Keep the skies clear.</i>

00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:18.652
Damn!

00:16:26.774 --> 00:16:28.293
Next time, baby.

00:16:52.197 --> 00:16:55.283
It's unwise to be in my company
right now, Brother.

00:16:56.285 --> 00:16:58.751
This was to be my day of triumph.

00:17:01.331 --> 00:17:02.862
It'll come.

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:05.252
In time.

00:17:05.335 --> 00:17:06.640
What's this?

00:17:09.047 --> 00:17:11.810
If it's any consolation,
I think you're right.

00:17:12.259 --> 00:17:15.403
About the Frost Giants,
about Laufey, about everything.

00:17:16.013 --> 00:17:19.058
If they found a way to penetrate
Asgard's defenses once…

00:17:19.141 --> 00:17:20.822
who's to say they won't try again?

00:17:20.905 --> 00:17:22.853
Next time with an army.
Exactly.

00:17:22.936 --> 00:17:26.035
There's nothing you can do
without defying Father.

00:17:27.948 --> 00:17:29.859
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I know that look.

00:17:29.942 --> 00:17:32.057
That's the only way
to ensure the safety of our borders.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.517
Thor, it's madness.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.727
Madness?

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.324
What sort of madness?

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:38.592
We're going to Jotunheim.

00:17:40.031 --> 00:17:41.332
What?

00:17:41.538 --> 00:17:43.290
This isn't like a journey to Earth…

00:17:43.373 --> 00:17:45.340
where you summon
a little lightning and thunder…

00:17:45.423 --> 00:17:47.570
and the mortals worship you as a god.

00:17:48.253 --> 00:17:49.369
This is Jotunheim.

00:17:49.452 --> 00:17:51.924
My father fought his way into Jotunheim…

00:17:52.007 --> 00:17:55.147
defeated their armies
and took their Casket.

00:17:55.265 --> 00:17:56.636
We would just be looking for answers.

00:17:56.719 --> 00:17:58.316
It is forbidden!

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:03.477
My friends, have you forgotten
all that we have done together?

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.354
Fandral, Hogun.

00:18:05.437 --> 00:18:08.616
Who led you
into the most glorious of battles?

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.455
You did.

00:18:10.567 --> 00:18:12.862
And Volstagg,
to delicacies so succulent…

00:18:12.945 --> 00:18:15.333
you thought you'd died
and gone to Valhalla?

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.976
You did.

00:18:18.059 --> 00:18:18.721
Yes!

00:18:18.804 --> 00:18:21.351
And who proved wrong
all who scoffed at the idea that…

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.516
a young maiden could be one
of the fiercest warriors…

00:18:23.599 --> 00:18:24.812
this realm has ever known?

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:26.014
I did.

00:18:26.308 --> 00:18:28.253
True, but I supported you Sif.

00:18:28.684 --> 00:18:29.999
My friends…

00:18:30.545 --> 00:18:32.521
we're going to Jotunheim.

00:19:23.983 --> 00:19:25.500
You leave this to me.

00:19:26.643 --> 00:19:29.271
Good Heimdall...
You're not dressed warmly enough.

00:19:29.354 --> 00:19:30.522
I'm sorry?

00:19:30.605 --> 00:19:32.920
Do you think that
you can deceive me?

00:19:34.164 --> 00:19:35.793
You must be mistaken...
Enough!

00:19:39.489 --> 00:19:41.283
Heimdall, may we pass?

00:19:41.366 --> 00:19:43.722
Never has an enemy…

00:19:43.805 --> 00:19:47.185
slipped my watch until this day.

00:19:49.463 --> 00:19:51.126
I wish to know how that happened.

00:19:51.209 --> 00:19:53.837
Then tell no one where we have gone
until we've returned.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.392
Understand?

00:20:00.082 --> 00:20:02.742
What happened?
Silver tongue turn to lead?

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.642
Be warned.

00:20:48.725 --> 00:20:53.509
I will honor my sworn oath
to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.608
If your return
threatens the safety of Asgard…

00:20:56.691 --> 00:20:59.236
Bifrost will remain closed to you…

00:20:59.319 --> 00:21:02.767
and you'll be left to die
in the cold waste of Jotunheim.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.735
Couldn't you just
leave the bridge open for us?

00:21:04.818 --> 00:21:06.034
To leave the bridge open…

00:21:06.117 --> 00:21:08.266
would unleash
the full power of the Bifrost…

00:21:08.349 --> 00:21:11.707
and destroy Jotunheim
with you upon it.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.922
I have no plans to die today.

00:21:14.005 --> 00:21:15.442
None do.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.392
We shouldn't be here.

00:22:05.302 --> 00:22:06.734
Let's move.

00:23:23.785 --> 00:23:25.290
Who are you supposed to be?

00:23:25.373 --> 00:23:26.515
I'm...

00:23:27.193 --> 00:23:28.605
Captain America.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.435
I beg your pardon?

00:23:34.493 --> 00:23:36.376
What, are we taking everybody?

00:23:36.871 --> 00:23:38.488
I am from Fresno, Ace.

00:23:38.571 --> 00:23:39.587
Is there anybody else?

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.417
I am looking for
a Sergeant James Barnes.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.291
There's an isolation ward in the factory,
but no one's ever come back from it.

00:23:44.374 --> 00:23:45.668
Alright.

00:23:46.027 --> 00:23:48.234
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.

00:23:48.317 --> 00:23:50.250
Get out fast and give them hell.

00:23:50.333 --> 00:23:52.205
I will meet you guys in the clearing
with anybody else I find.

00:23:52.288 --> 00:23:53.288
Wait.

00:23:53.375 --> 00:23:54.453
You know what you're doing?

00:23:54.536 --> 00:23:55.065
Yeah.

00:23:55.148 --> 00:23:57.781
I have knocked out
Adolf Hitler over 200 times.

00:24:22.617 --> 00:24:24.011
You know how to use that thing?

00:24:29.004 --> 00:24:30.004
Ok.

00:24:31.932 --> 00:24:33.203
What is happening?

00:24:41.327 --> 00:24:42.329
Hey.

00:24:42.522 --> 00:24:44.295
Not exactly a Buick.

00:24:44.906 --> 00:24:47.140
- That one. Zundung.
- Zundung?

00:24:47.666 --> 00:24:48.826
Get this thing going, Dugan.

00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:50.172
I didn't know you spoke German.

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:51.530
Three semesters at Howard…

00:24:51.613 --> 00:24:53.470
switched to French, girls much cuter.

00:24:53.553 --> 00:24:54.926
Didn't ask for the resume.

00:25:48.188 --> 00:25:49.565
Where are they?

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:51.011
Hiding…

00:25:51.094 --> 00:25:52.987
as cowards always do.

00:26:03.036 --> 00:26:07.333
You've come a long way to die,
Asgardians.

00:26:07.416 --> 00:26:09.653
I am Thor Odinson!

00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:12.371
We know who you are.

00:26:12.454 --> 00:26:15.132
How did your people get into Asgarol?

00:26:24.057 --> 00:26:26.159
The House of Odin…

00:26:26.242 --> 00:26:28.187
is full of traitors.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.364
Do not dishonor my father's name
with your lies!

00:26:31.708 --> 00:26:34.818
Your father is a murderer and a thief!

00:26:34.901 --> 00:26:36.692
And why have you come here?

00:26:36.775 --> 00:26:38.322
To make peace?

00:26:38.405 --> 00:26:40.321
You long for battle.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.076
You crave it.

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:44.188
You're nothing but a boy…

00:26:44.327 --> 00:26:47.050
trying to prove himself a man.

00:26:48.248 --> 00:26:49.694
This boy…

00:26:49.777 --> 00:26:52.034
has grown tired of your mockery.

00:26:58.317 --> 00:27:00.803
Thor, stop and think.

00:27:00.886 --> 00:27:02.461
Look around you,
we're outnumbered.

00:27:02.544 --> 00:27:04.181
Know your place, Brother.

00:27:04.264 --> 00:27:07.887
You know not
what your actions would unleash.

00:27:10.562 --> 00:27:12.159
I do.

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:16.812
Go now, while I still allow it.

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:29.197
We will accept…

00:27:29.304 --> 00:27:31.459
your most gracious offer.

00:27:43.386 --> 00:27:45.154
Come on, Brother.

00:27:50.352 --> 00:27:52.905
Run back home, little princess.

00:27:53.063 --> 00:27:54.364
Damn.

00:27:59.569 --> 00:28:00.805
Next?

00:28:19.923 --> 00:28:22.396
At least make it a challenge for me!

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:44.515
That's more like it.

00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:21.529
Don't let them touch you!

00:30:03.193 --> 00:30:04.432
Thor!

00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:09.012
We must go!
Then go!

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.870
Run!

00:30:35.725 --> 00:30:37.005
Thor!

00:31:42.792 --> 00:31:44.277
Heimdall!

00:31:44.414 --> 00:31:45.931
Open the bridge!

00:32:51.611 --> 00:32:54.567
Father! We'll finish them together!

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:56.293
Silence!

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.573
Allfather.

00:33:04.499 --> 00:33:06.972
You look weary.

00:33:08.545 --> 00:33:09.828
Laufey…

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:11.772
end this now.

00:33:11.965 --> 00:33:14.313
Your boy sought this out.

00:33:14.676 --> 00:33:16.094
You're right.

00:33:17.554 --> 00:33:19.515
And these are the actions of a boy…

00:33:19.779 --> 00:33:21.206
treat them as such.

00:33:21.391 --> 00:33:22.902
You and I can end this…

00:33:22.985 --> 00:33:24.259
here and now…

00:33:24.343 --> 00:33:25.729
before there is further bloodshed.

00:33:25.812 --> 00:33:29.471
We are beyond diplomacy now,
Allfather.

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:32.865
He'll get what he came for.

00:33:33.569 --> 00:33:34.814
War…

00:33:35.015 --> 00:33:36.564
and death.

00:33:37.991 --> 00:33:39.385
So be it.

00:34:25.201 --> 00:34:26.777
Looks like you were right.

00:34:27.322 --> 00:34:29.081
He was building a suit.

00:34:29.164 --> 00:34:30.922
I thought it'd be bigger.

00:35:27.809 --> 00:35:30.010
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is going to hold up?

00:35:30.093 --> 00:35:32.350
<i>The suit's at 48%
power and falling, sir.</i>

00:35:32.433 --> 00:35:35.063
<i>That chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.</i>

00:35:35.146 --> 00:35:36.698
Keep me posted.

00:35:38.441 --> 00:35:39.443
<i>Pepper!</i>

00:35:39.526 --> 00:35:40.986
Tony! Tony, are you ok?

00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:42.529
<i>I'm fine. How are...</i>

00:35:42.612 --> 00:35:44.531
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
<i>- I know.</i>

00:35:44.614 --> 00:35:46.478
<i>- Listen, you'd better get out of there.</i>
- He built a suit.

00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:48.341
<i>Get out of there right now!</i>

00:35:59.838 --> 00:36:01.874
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

00:36:07.639 --> 00:36:10.603
<i>Your services are no longer required.</i>

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.389
<i>Stane!</i>

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.148
<i>I love this suit!</i>

00:36:39.231 --> 00:36:40.337
<i>Put them down!</i>

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.711
<i>Collateral damage, Tony.</i>

00:36:44.049 --> 00:36:45.828
Divert power to chest RT.

00:36:54.832 --> 00:36:57.009
<i>Power reduced to 19%.</i>

00:37:04.819 --> 00:37:06.119
<i>Lady!</i>

00:37:07.822 --> 00:37:10.083
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:35.066
<i>For 30 years,
I've been holding you up!</i>

00:37:39.354 --> 00:37:41.739
<i>I built this company from nothing!</i>

00:37:44.025 --> 00:37:46.661
<i>Nothing is going to stand in my way.</i>

00:37:52.867 --> 00:37:54.356
<i>Least of all…</i>

00:37:54.534 --> 00:37:55.699
<i>you!</i>

00:38:04.879 --> 00:38:06.334
<i>Impressive!</i>

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:08.550
<i>You've upgraded your armor!</i>

00:38:08.633 --> 00:38:11.259
<i>I've made some
upgrades of my own!</i>

00:38:19.769 --> 00:38:21.730
<i>Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.</i>

00:38:21.813 --> 00:38:23.482
Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.

00:38:23.565 --> 00:38:25.859
<i>With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that…</i>

00:38:25.942 --> 00:38:28.013
I know the math!
Do it!

00:38:36.411 --> 00:38:37.808
Sir, you're not going to believe this.

00:38:37.891 --> 00:38:38.705
That thing is back.

00:38:38.788 --> 00:38:39.688
Get me Major Allen.

00:38:39.771 --> 00:38:41.370
Scramble the jets!

00:38:44.127 --> 00:38:47.237
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

00:39:07.733 --> 00:39:10.134
No, no.
What are you doing?

00:39:11.011 --> 00:39:13.795
Our forces are outmatched.

00:39:38.805 --> 00:39:39.970
Keep moving.

00:39:40.053 --> 00:39:41.463
Grab those grenades.

00:40:20.948 --> 00:40:22.290
Sergeant.

00:40:22.523 --> 00:40:24.872
Three-two-five-five-seven.

00:40:25.052 --> 00:40:26.055
Bucky?

00:40:27.255 --> 00:40:28.522
Oh, my God.

00:40:33.424 --> 00:40:35.069
Is that...
It's me.

00:40:35.152 --> 00:40:37.140
It's Steve.
Steve?

00:40:37.223 --> 00:40:39.030
Come on.
Steve.

00:40:42.611 --> 00:40:44.293
I thought you were dead.

00:40:44.633 --> 00:40:46.298
I thought you were smaller.

00:40:54.136 --> 00:40:55.269
Come on.

00:40:57.673 --> 00:40:58.820
What happened to you?

00:40:58.903 --> 00:41:00.450
I joined the Army.

00:41:06.527 --> 00:41:07.538
Did it hurt?

00:41:07.621 --> 00:41:08.827
A little.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.494
Is this permanent?

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:11.849
So far.

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:43.400
Captain America.

00:41:43.483 --> 00:41:45.410
How exciting.

00:41:45.949 --> 00:41:48.806
I am a great fan of your films.

00:41:50.835 --> 00:41:54.582
So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.

00:41:54.956 --> 00:41:57.462
Not exactly an improvement but…

00:41:57.545 --> 00:41:58.545
still…

00:41:59.121 --> 00:42:00.397
impressive.

00:42:03.005 --> 00:42:04.575
You have got no idea.

00:42:07.864 --> 00:42:09.124
Haven't I?

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:27.619
No matter what lies Erskine told you…

00:42:27.702 --> 00:42:30.608
you see, I was his greatest success.

00:42:44.247 --> 00:42:46.225
You don't have one of those, do you?

00:42:46.338 --> 00:42:48.706
You are deluded, Captain.

00:42:49.049 --> 00:42:51.755
You pretend to be a simple soldier…

00:42:51.838 --> 00:42:53.195
but in reality…

00:42:53.278 --> 00:42:57.998
you are just afraid to admit that
we have left humanity behind.

00:42:59.976 --> 00:43:03.326
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:05.225
Without fear.

00:43:05.308 --> 00:43:06.905
Then how come you're running?

00:43:18.378 --> 00:43:20.535
Come on, let's go. Up.

00:43:23.765 --> 00:43:26.241
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

00:43:29.373 --> 00:43:30.970
What about me?

00:43:31.249 --> 00:43:32.841
Where will I sit?

00:43:33.671 --> 00:43:35.096
Not a scratch, Doctor.

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:36.567
Not a scratch.

00:44:09.629 --> 00:44:11.690
Let's go.
One at a time.

00:44:40.804 --> 00:44:42.918
- Got to be a rope or something.
- Just go!

00:44:43.001 --> 00:44:43.722
Get out of here!

00:44:43.805 --> 00:44:45.571
No. Not without you!

00:44:45.865 --> 00:44:47.147
Hell.

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:12.351
<i>- Thirteen percent power, sir.</i>
- Climb!

00:45:16.096 --> 00:45:18.106
<i>- Eleven percent.</i>
- Keep going!

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:26.975
<i>- Seven percent power.</i>
- Just leave it on the screen!

00:45:27.058 --> 00:45:28.230
Stop telling me!

00:45:38.327 --> 00:45:43.026
<i>You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!</i>

00:45:43.397 --> 00:45:45.307
<i>How'd you solve the icing problem?</i>

00:45:45.579 --> 00:45:47.003
<i>Icing problem?</i>

00:45:49.338 --> 00:45:50.931
<i>Might want to look into it.</i>

00:46:03.352 --> 00:46:04.652
<i>Two percent.</i>

00:46:06.772 --> 00:46:09.305
<i>We are now running on
emergency backup power.</i>

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:22.662
Potts!
Tony!

00:46:22.745 --> 00:46:24.790
Oh, my God, are you ok?

00:46:24.873 --> 00:46:26.068
I'm almost out of power.

00:46:26.151 --> 00:46:27.213
I've got to get out of this thing.

00:46:27.296 --> 00:46:28.864
I'll be right there.

00:46:29.128 --> 00:46:30.392
<i>Nice try!</i>

00:46:42.808 --> 00:46:44.763
Weapons status?

00:46:44.977 --> 00:46:47.562
<i>Repulsors offline.
Missiles offline.</i>

00:46:51.442 --> 00:46:52.783
Flares!

00:47:01.535 --> 00:47:03.754
<i>Very clever, Tony.</i>

00:47:08.917 --> 00:47:10.080
Potts?

00:47:10.495 --> 00:47:11.406
Tony!

00:47:11.489 --> 00:47:12.158
This isn't working.

00:47:12.241 --> 00:47:14.814
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

00:47:14.897 --> 00:47:16.378
Well, how are you going to do that?

00:47:16.461 --> 00:47:17.760
You're going to do it.

00:47:17.843 --> 00:47:20.304
<i>Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.</i>

00:47:20.387 --> 00:47:21.806
When I get clear of the
roof, I'll let you know.

00:47:21.889 --> 00:47:24.176
You're going to hit the
master bypass button.

00:47:24.376 --> 00:47:26.298
It's going to fry everything up here.

00:47:28.103 --> 00:47:30.398
Ok. I'm going in now.

00:47:30.481 --> 00:47:33.659
Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof. I'll buy you some time.

00:47:43.285 --> 00:47:44.869
<i>This looks important!</i>

00:48:05.933 --> 00:48:08.706
I never had a taste for this sort of thing…

00:48:08.811 --> 00:48:10.579
but I must admit…

00:48:10.817 --> 00:48:13.209
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:23.834
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

00:48:26.078 --> 00:48:28.338
You'd have made your father proud!

00:48:33.168 --> 00:48:35.569
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:56.658
Tony!

00:48:57.693 --> 00:48:59.620
How ironic, Tony!

00:49:01.277 --> 00:49:03.527
Trying to rid the world of weapons…

00:49:03.949 --> 00:49:06.202
you gave it its best one ever!

00:49:06.285 --> 00:49:07.429
Pepper!

00:49:07.512 --> 00:49:08.950
And now…

00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:12.205
I'm going to kill you with it!

00:49:15.344 --> 00:49:17.588
You ripped out my targeting system!

00:49:17.671 --> 00:49:19.203
Time to hit the button!

00:49:19.286 --> 00:49:21.206
You told me not to!

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.435
Hold still, you little prick!

00:49:25.241 --> 00:49:26.519
Just do it!

00:49:26.602 --> 00:49:28.219
You'll die!

00:49:30.893 --> 00:49:32.443
Push it!

00:50:29.993 --> 00:50:31.753
<i>Tony!</i>

00:50:42.975 --> 00:50:44.951
Senator Brandt, I…

00:50:45.105 --> 00:50:50.171
regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers
went missing behind enemy lines on the…

00:50:50.254 --> 00:50:51.177
third.

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.527
Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:54.763
As a result…

00:50:54.846 --> 00:50:57.674
I must declare Captain Rogers…

00:50:58.235 --> 00:51:00.526
killed in action. Period.

00:51:04.448 --> 00:51:06.477
The last surveillance flight is back.

00:51:08.695 --> 00:51:10.414
No sign of activity.

00:51:11.484 --> 00:51:12.916
Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.

00:51:12.999 --> 00:51:14.126
Yes, sir.

00:51:16.962 --> 00:51:19.024
I can't touch Stark.
He's rich…

00:51:19.211 --> 00:51:21.224
and he's the Army's number one
weapons contractor.

00:51:21.307 --> 00:51:22.282
You are neither one.

00:51:22.365 --> 00:51:24.822
With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.

00:51:24.953 --> 00:51:26.705
And I don't think
Captain Rogers did, either.

00:51:26.788 --> 00:51:29.674
What makes you think
I give a damn about your opinions?

00:51:29.774 --> 00:51:31.391
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

00:51:31.474 --> 00:51:34.971
And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead…

00:51:35.487 --> 00:51:36.466
because you had a crush.

00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:37.622
It wasn't that.

00:51:37.979 --> 00:51:39.136
I had faith.

00:51:39.219 --> 00:51:43.195
Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down.

00:51:46.096 --> 00:51:48.057
What the hell's going on out there?

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.029
Look who it is.

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:01.313
Some of these men
need medical attention.

00:53:01.396 --> 00:53:03.917
Medic, we got wounded.
Right over here.

00:53:04.054 --> 00:53:06.456
I'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.

00:53:07.839 --> 00:53:09.552
That won't be necessary.

00:53:13.149 --> 00:53:14.677
Yes, sir.

00:53:16.165 --> 00:53:17.428
Faith?

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.434
You're late.

00:53:29.619 --> 00:53:31.170
Couldn't call my ride.

00:53:33.136 --> 00:53:34.321
Hey!

00:53:35.118 --> 00:53:37.204
Let's hear it for Captain America.

00:53:53.523 --> 00:53:56.700
I am honored to present
this medal for valor…

00:53:56.783 --> 00:53:59.070
to my personal friend...

00:53:59.552 --> 00:54:01.187
Captain America.

00:54:03.489 --> 00:54:04.996
Captain America.

00:54:06.545 --> 00:54:08.539
Captain, that's your cue.

00:54:12.427 --> 00:54:14.531
I thought he'd be taller.

00:54:18.893 --> 00:54:20.019
<i>Why did you bring us back?</i>

00:54:20.102 --> 00:54:21.104
<i>Do you realize what you've done?</i>

00:54:21.187 --> 00:54:22.981
<i>- What you've started?
- I was protecting my home.</i>

00:54:23.064 --> 00:54:24.578
<i>You cannot even protect your friends!</i>

00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:26.484
How can you hope
to protect a kingdom?

00:54:26.567 --> 00:54:28.395
Get him to the healing room! Now!

00:54:28.478 --> 00:54:31.988
There won't be a kingdom
to protect if you're afraid to act.

00:54:32.907 --> 00:54:36.995
The Jotuns must learn to fear me,
just as they once feared you.

00:54:37.078 --> 00:54:39.612
That's pride and vanity talking,
not leadership.

00:54:39.695 --> 00:54:41.322
You've forgotten everything I taught you…

00:54:41.545 --> 00:54:42.584
about a warrior's patience.

00:54:42.667 --> 00:54:46.495
While you wait and be patient,
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

00:54:46.706 --> 00:54:47.797
The old ways are done.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.717
You'd stand giving speeches
while Asgard falls.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.138
You are a vain…

00:54:52.221 --> 00:54:53.256
greedy…

00:54:53.339 --> 00:54:54.318
cruel boy!

00:54:54.401 --> 00:54:57.266
And you are an old man and a fool!

00:55:03.938 --> 00:55:05.263
Yes.

00:55:06.208 --> 00:55:07.607
I was a fool…

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.397
to think you were ready.

00:55:10.653 --> 00:55:11.653
Father…

00:55:15.282 --> 00:55:18.242
Thor Odinson…

00:55:19.995 --> 00:55:23.344
you have betrayed
the express command of your king.

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:25.863
Through your arrogance and stupidity…

00:55:25.946 --> 00:55:28.880
you've opened these peaceful realms
and innocent lives…

00:55:28.963 --> 00:55:33.133
to the horror and desolation of war!

00:55:38.723 --> 00:55:39.923
You are…

00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:42.852
unworthy of these realms!

00:55:42.935 --> 00:55:45.452
You're unworthy of your title!

00:55:45.841 --> 00:55:47.399
You're unworthy…

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.455
of the loved ones…

00:55:52.366 --> 00:55:53.885
you have betrayed.

00:56:04.749 --> 00:56:06.323
I now take from you…

00:56:06.406 --> 00:56:07.535
your power!

00:56:08.243 --> 00:56:10.178
In the name of my father…

00:56:11.124 --> 00:56:13.214
and his father before…

00:56:13.674 --> 00:56:15.440
I, Odin Allfather…

00:56:15.523 --> 00:56:16.892
cast you out!

00:56:23.128 --> 00:56:25.254
Whosoever holds this hammer…

00:56:25.341 --> 00:56:28.326
if he be worthy,
shall possess the power of Thor.

00:57:25.581 --> 00:57:28.042
<i>You've all received the official
statement of what occurred…</i>

00:57:28.125 --> 00:57:30.158
<i>at Stark Industries last night.</i>

00:57:30.553 --> 00:57:35.100
<i>There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned…</i>

00:57:35.183 --> 00:57:37.797
<i>and caused damage to the arc reactor.</i>

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:40.772
<i>Fortunately, a member of Tony
Stark's personal security staff...</i>

00:57:40.855 --> 00:57:42.774
Iron Man. That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

00:57:42.857 --> 00:57:44.359
I mean, it's not technically accurate.

00:57:44.442 --> 00:57:46.528
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy…

00:57:46.611 --> 00:57:49.218
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

00:57:49.301 --> 00:57:50.811
Here's your alibi.

00:57:51.825 --> 00:57:52.910
Ok.

00:57:52.993 --> 00:57:55.120
You were on your yacht.
Yeah.

00:57:55.203 --> 00:57:57.414
We have port papers that put
you in Avalon all night…

00:57:57.497 --> 00:57:59.208
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

00:57:59.291 --> 00:58:02.419
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me…

00:58:02.502 --> 00:58:04.470
alone on the island.

00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:06.882
That's what happened.
Alright.

00:58:06.965 --> 00:58:08.668
Just read it, word for word.

00:58:10.948 --> 00:58:12.453
There's nothing about Stane here.

00:58:12.994 --> 00:58:14.552
That's being handled.

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.282
He's on vacation.

00:58:16.766 --> 00:58:18.163
Small aircraft have such…

00:58:18.246 --> 00:58:19.228
a poor safety record.

00:58:19.311 --> 00:58:21.813
But what about the whole cover
story that it's a bodyguard?

00:58:21.896 --> 00:58:24.619
He's my body... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

00:58:24.772 --> 00:58:27.009
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

00:58:27.235 --> 00:58:28.649
Just stick to the official statement…

00:58:28.732 --> 00:58:30.558
and soon, this will all be behind you.

00:58:31.323 --> 00:58:33.875
You've got 90 seconds.

00:58:36.409 --> 00:58:37.904
Agent Coulson?

00:58:38.788 --> 00:58:40.636
I just wanted to say thank you…

00:58:40.719 --> 00:58:43.121
very much for all of your help.

00:58:43.282 --> 00:58:44.625
That's what we do.

00:58:45.012 --> 00:58:46.505
You'll be hearing from us.

00:58:46.588 --> 00:58:48.176
From the Strategic Homeland Int...

00:58:48.259 --> 00:58:49.647
Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:58:50.258 --> 00:58:51.488
Right.

00:58:52.427 --> 00:58:53.929
Let's get this show on the road.

00:58:54.012 --> 00:58:56.348
You know, it's actually not that bad.

00:58:56.431 --> 00:58:58.354
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

00:58:58.808 --> 00:59:00.352
- You're not Iron Man.
- I am.

00:59:00.435 --> 00:59:02.249
- You're not.
- So. Alright, so...

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:04.482
You know, if I were Iron Man…

00:59:04.565 --> 00:59:06.984
I'd have this girlfriend
who knew my true identity.

00:59:07.067 --> 00:59:08.527
She'd be a wreck, because
she'd always be worrying…

00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:09.413
that I was going to die…

00:59:09.496 --> 00:59:12.071
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

00:59:12.154 --> 00:59:13.154
She'd be…

00:59:13.517 --> 00:59:16.184
wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more…

00:59:17.681 --> 00:59:18.684
crazy about me.

00:59:18.767 --> 00:59:20.381
Tell me you never think
about that night.

00:59:20.497 --> 00:59:22.009
- What night?
- You know.

00:59:25.293 --> 00:59:26.700
Are you talking about…

00:59:27.199 --> 00:59:28.937
the night that we danced and…

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:31.305
went up on the roof and…

00:59:32.676 --> 00:59:33.720
and then…

00:59:34.956 --> 00:59:36.936
you went downstairs to…

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.584
get me a drink and you…

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:41.886
left me there, by myself?

00:59:42.811 --> 00:59:44.501
Is that the night you're talking about?

00:59:47.524 --> 00:59:48.824
Thought so.

00:59:51.319 --> 00:59:55.073
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

00:59:55.156 --> 00:59:56.914
And now, Mr. Stark…

00:59:56.997 --> 00:59:58.642
has prepared a statement.

00:59:58.725 --> 01:00:00.774
He will not be taking any questions.

01:00:00.857 --> 01:00:01.934
Thank you.

01:00:06.042 --> 01:00:07.547
Been a while since I was…

01:00:07.803 --> 01:00:10.150
in front of you. I figure
I'll stick to the cards this time.

01:00:13.115 --> 01:00:16.178
<i>There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred…</i>

01:00:16.261 --> 01:00:17.605
<i>on the freeway and the rooftop…</i>

01:00:17.688 --> 01:00:20.432
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that…</i>

01:00:20.515 --> 01:00:22.084
that was a bodyguard in a suit…

01:00:22.167 --> 01:00:24.269
that conveniently appeared…

01:00:24.352 --> 01:00:27.241
- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

01:00:27.452 --> 01:00:31.151
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely…

01:00:31.234 --> 01:00:34.488
to make wild accusations, or
insinuate that I'm a superhero.

01:00:34.571 --> 01:00:36.150
I never said you were a superhero.

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:37.216
Didn't?

01:00:37.299 --> 01:00:39.919
Well good, because
that would be outlandish and…

01:00:40.878 --> 01:00:42.027
fantastic.

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.568
I…

01:00:44.651 --> 01:00:47.292
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:48.758
With this…

01:00:49.042 --> 01:00:50.462
laundry list of character defects…

01:00:50.545 --> 01:00:51.794
all the mistakes I've made…

01:00:51.877 --> 01:00:53.632
largely public.

01:00:53.715 --> 01:00:55.300
Just stick to the cards, man.

01:00:55.383 --> 01:00:57.143
Yeah, ok. Yeah.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.458
The truth is.

01:01:06.937 --> 01:01:08.391
I am Iron Man.
