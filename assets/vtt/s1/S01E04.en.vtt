00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:23.082
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:25.402
I need you to go to my office.

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:28.362
You're going to hack into the
mainframe and you're going to retrieve all

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:31.042
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:32.682
This'll get you in.

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:34.362
It's probably under
Executive Files.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.882
If not, they put it on a ghost
drive, in which case you need

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:39.602
to look for the lowest
numeric heading.

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:42.362
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:43.522
Same drill.

00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:45.602
They've been dealing under the
table, and I'm going to stop them.

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:48.802
I'm going to find my
weapons and destroy them.

00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:50.802
Tony,

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:55.002
you know that I would
help you with anything,

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:59.042
but I cannot help you if you're
going to start all of this again.

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:02.722
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:06.242
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:10.402
There is the next
mission and nothing else.

00:01:11.602 --> 00:01:12.962
Is that so?

00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:16.642
Well, then, I quit.

00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:21.362
You stood by my
side all these years

00:01:21.402 --> 00:01:24.242
while I reaped the
benefits of destruction.

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:26.402
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:28.322
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

00:01:28.402 --> 00:01:30.922
You're going to
kill yourself, Tony.

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:32.882
I'm not going
to be a part of it.

00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:34.922
I shouldn't be alive,

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:38.402
unless it was for a reason.

00:01:39.202 --> 00:01:41.082
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:44.762
I just finally know
what I have to do.

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:51.882
And I know in my
heart that it's right.

00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:10.042
You're all I have,
too, you know.

00:03:19.602 --> 00:03:24.402
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

00:03:37.322 --> 00:03:41.682
<i>You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.</i>

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.282
<i>- As you can see, Obadiah Stane...</i>
- Oh, my God.

00:03:43.362 --> 00:03:46.082
<i>...your deception and
lies will cost you dearly.</i>

00:03:46.162 --> 00:03:48.882
<i>The price to kill Tony
Stark has just gone up.</i>

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:57.282
So, what are we
going to do about this?

00:03:59.922 --> 00:04:00.962
Hmm?

00:04:09.242 --> 00:04:12.562
I know what you're
going through, Pepper.

00:04:20.242 --> 00:04:23.962
Tony. He always gets the
good stuff, doesn't he?

00:04:45.602 --> 00:04:50.002
I was so happy
when he came home.

00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:52.882
It was like we got him
back from the dead.

00:04:55.922 --> 00:04:57.882
Now I realize,

00:05:00.162 --> 00:05:03.442
well, Tony never really
did come home, did he?

00:05:05.162 --> 00:05:07.882
He left a part of
himself in that cave.

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:12.242
Breaks my heart.

00:05:14.562 --> 00:05:18.522
Well, he's a complicated person.

00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:24.642
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

00:05:30.962 --> 00:05:33.682
You are a very rare woman.

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:38.362
Tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.

00:05:41.122 --> 00:05:43.122
Thank you. Thanks.

00:05:45.122 --> 00:05:47.162
I'd better get back there.

00:05:52.642 --> 00:05:54.682
Is that today's paper?

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:57.362
Yes.

00:05:58.162 --> 00:05:59.522
Do you mind?

00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:01.962
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

00:06:02.002 --> 00:06:03.362
Of course.

00:06:06.842 --> 00:06:08.202
Take care.

00:06:32.322 --> 00:06:34.082
Ms. Potts?
We had an appointment.

00:06:34.162 --> 00:06:35.202
Did you forget about
our appointment?

00:06:35.322 --> 00:06:36.842
Nope, right now. Come with me.

00:06:36.882 --> 00:06:38.042
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

00:06:38.082 --> 00:06:39.882
- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:43.282
I'm going to give you the
meeting of your life. Your office.

00:06:44.802 --> 00:06:47.642
Yeah, we've been
working our best to do it.

00:06:48.042 --> 00:06:51.562
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

00:06:51.722 --> 00:06:54.442
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored

00:06:54.522 --> 00:06:56.802
what you've asked us, and it
seems as though there's a little hiccup.

00:06:56.882 --> 00:06:58.562
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

00:06:58.602 --> 00:07:02.442
Yes, to power the suit, sir, the
technology actually doesn't exist.

00:07:02.682 --> 00:07:05.842
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

00:07:05.922 --> 00:07:08.842
William, here is the technology.

00:07:09.682 --> 00:07:11.922
I've asked you to
simply make it smaller.

00:07:11.962 --> 00:07:15.962
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

00:07:16.042 --> 00:07:22.642
Tony Stark was able to build
this in a cave! With a box of scraps!

00:07:24.842 --> 00:07:27.922
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not Tony Stark.

00:07:44.042 --> 00:07:46.122
<i>Tony?</i>

00:07:47.802 --> 00:07:51.082
<i>Tony, are you there? Hello?</i>

00:07:52.642 --> 00:07:53.882
Breathe.

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.802
Easy, easy.

00:07:59.842 --> 00:08:02.162
You remember this one, right?

00:08:03.842 --> 00:08:06.202
It's a shame the
government didn't approve it.

00:08:06.282 --> 00:08:10.402
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

00:08:12.362 --> 00:08:13.642
Ah, Tony.

00:08:16.322 --> 00:08:20.642
When I ordered the hit on you,

00:08:23.282 --> 00:08:25.802
I worried that I was

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.842
killing the golden goose.

00:08:32.162 --> 00:08:35.922
But, you see, it was just

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:39.562
fate that you survived that.

00:08:44.642 --> 00:08:48.522
You had one last
golden egg to give.

00:08:52.682 --> 00:08:58.002
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

00:09:01.882 --> 00:09:07.042
Your father, he helped
give us the atomic bomb.

00:09:07.082 --> 00:09:11.362
Now, what kind of world would it
be today if he was as selfish as you?

00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:23.002
Oh, it's beautiful.

00:09:25.602 --> 00:09:30.442
Oh, Tony, this is
your Ninth Symphony.

00:09:32.242 --> 00:09:34.762
Ah. What a masterpiece.
Look at that.

00:09:36.562 --> 00:09:38.362
This is your legacy.

00:09:40.922 --> 00:09:46.082
A new generation of
weapons with this at its heart.

00:09:49.282 --> 00:09:53.042
Weapons that will help steer
the world back on course,

00:09:53.082 --> 00:09:55.362
put the balance of
power in our hands.

00:09:56.922 --> 00:09:58.602
The right hands.

00:10:01.722 --> 00:10:06.282
I wish you could
see my prototype.

00:10:07.642 --> 00:10:09.122
It's not as...

00:10:10.482 --> 00:10:13.482
Well, not as
conservative as yours.

00:10:15.522 --> 00:10:18.362
Too bad you had to
involve Pepper in this.

00:10:18.762 --> 00:10:21.402
I would have
preferred that she lived.

00:11:08.594 --> 00:11:10.234
Think you got enough?

00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:13.634
Any hope of
reproducing the program

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:15.874
is locked in your genetic code.

00:11:16.474 --> 00:11:19.154
But without Dr. Erskine,
it would take years.

00:11:20.474 --> 00:11:22.194
He deserved more than this.

00:11:23.554 --> 00:11:27.074
If it could work only once,
he'd be proud it was you.

00:11:29.954 --> 00:11:32.874
Colonel Phillips, my committee
is demanding answers.

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:34.834
Great. Why don't we
start with how

00:11:34.874 --> 00:11:38.074
a German spy got a ride to my
secret installation in your car?

00:11:38.154 --> 00:11:39.674
What have we got here?

00:11:39.754 --> 00:11:42.834
Speaking modestly, I'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

00:11:43.114 --> 00:11:45.834
But I don't know what's
inside this thing or how it works.

00:11:46.234 --> 00:11:47.754
We're not even close
to this technology.

00:11:47.834 --> 00:11:49.514
- Then who is?
- Hydra.

00:11:50.074 --> 00:11:51.514
I'm sure you've been
reading our briefings.

00:11:51.994 --> 00:11:53.994
I'm on a number of
committees, Colonel.

00:11:54.074 --> 00:11:56.354
Hydra is the Nazi
deep-science division.

00:11:56.394 --> 00:12:00.034
It's led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.

00:12:00.114 --> 00:12:01.354
Hydra is practically a cult.

00:12:01.394 --> 00:12:03.034
They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:04.674
So, what are you
going to do about it?

00:12:05.714 --> 00:12:07.034
I spoke to the
President this morning.

00:12:07.474 --> 00:12:10.514
- As of today, the SSR is being retasked.
- Colonel?

00:12:10.594 --> 00:12:13.954
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:15.354
You, too, Stark.

00:12:15.714 --> 00:12:17.354
We're flying to London tonight.

00:12:17.434 --> 00:12:19.794
Sir? If you're going
after Schmidt, I want in.

00:12:20.034 --> 00:12:22.034
You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.

00:12:22.634 --> 00:12:23.714
The serum worked.

00:12:23.794 --> 00:12:25.634
I asked for an army
and all I got was you.

00:12:26.194 --> 00:12:28.834
You are not enough.

00:12:32.954 --> 00:12:34.314
With all due respect
to the Colonel,

00:12:34.914 --> 00:12:36.754
I think we may be
missing the point.

00:12:37.114 --> 00:12:39.154
I've seen you in action, Steve.

00:12:39.234 --> 00:12:41.434
More importantly,
the country's seen it.

00:12:41.754 --> 00:12:42.754
Paper.

00:12:43.714 --> 00:12:45.434
The enlistment lines
have been around the block

00:12:45.514 --> 00:12:47.954
since your picture
hit the newsstands.

00:12:48.034 --> 00:12:51.194
You don't take a soldier,
a symbol like that,

00:12:51.634 --> 00:12:53.394
and hide him in a lab.

00:12:53.914 --> 00:12:57.874
Son, do you want to
serve your country

00:12:57.914 --> 00:13:00.914
on the most important
battlefield of the war?

00:13:02.194 --> 00:13:04.234
Sir, that's all I want.

00:13:04.794 --> 00:13:08.234
Then, congratulations.
You just got promoted.

00:13:11.354 --> 00:13:12.594
I don't know if I can do this.

00:13:12.634 --> 00:13:14.594
Nothing to it.
You sell a few bonds.

00:13:14.674 --> 00:13:17.314
Bonds buy bullets.
Bullets kill Nazis. Bing bang boom.

00:13:17.674 --> 00:13:19.274
You're an American hero.

00:13:19.434 --> 00:13:21.634
It's just not how I
pictured getting there.

00:13:22.274 --> 00:13:24.354
The Senator has got a
lot of pull up on the Hill.

00:13:24.434 --> 00:13:25.594
You play ball with us,

00:13:25.634 --> 00:13:27.594
you'll be leading your
own platoon in no time.

00:13:27.674 --> 00:13:29.234
Take the shield.

How many of you are ready to
help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?

00:16:13.794 --> 00:16:14.994
Okay.

00:16:16.474 --> 00:16:17.474
Uh...

00:16:17.914 --> 00:16:19.954
I need a volunteer.

00:16:20.034 --> 00:16:22.274
I already volunteered!
How do you think I got here?

00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:25.794
Bring back the girls!

00:16:29.794 --> 00:16:32.114
I think they only know
the one song, but, um,

00:16:32.834 --> 00:16:34.314
I'll see what I can do.

00:16:34.634 --> 00:16:36.314
You do that, sweetheart.

00:16:36.794 --> 00:16:39.474
Nice boots, Tinker Bell!

00:16:40.514 --> 00:16:42.914
Come on, guys, we're
all on the same team here.

00:16:43.074 --> 00:16:45.314
Hey, Captain! Sign this!

00:16:56.114 --> 00:16:57.994
Bring back the girls!

00:17:02.594 --> 00:17:05.274
Don't worry, pal.
They'll warm up to you. Don't worry.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.590
What do you mean, he
paid to have Tony killed?

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.310
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.830
Okay, where's Tony now?

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:20.630
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.830
Please go over there and
make sure everything's okay.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.510
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.150
Good boy.

00:19:20.184 --> 00:19:21.544
Hello, Steve.

00:19:22.864 --> 00:19:24.064
Hi.

00:19:25.104 --> 00:19:27.344
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

00:19:27.384 --> 00:19:29.624
Officially, I'm not here at all.

00:19:30.064 --> 00:19:32.024
That was quite a performance.

00:19:32.384 --> 00:19:33.384
Yeah.

00:19:34.544 --> 00:19:36.224
I had to improvise a little bit.

00:19:36.544 --> 00:19:39.064
The crowds I'm used
to are usually more, uh,

00:19:40.664 --> 00:19:41.664
twelve.

00:19:41.744 --> 00:19:43.704
I understand you're
"America's New Hope."

00:19:43.744 --> 00:19:46.384
Bond sales take a 10%
bump in every state I visit.

00:19:46.424 --> 00:19:47.984
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?

00:19:49.584 --> 00:19:51.704
At least he's got me doing this.

00:19:51.744 --> 00:19:53.344
Phillips would have
had me stuck in a lab.

00:19:53.584 --> 00:19:56.064
And these are your
only two options?

00:19:56.424 --> 00:19:58.744
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

00:19:59.424 --> 00:20:02.104
You were meant for
more than this, you know.

00:20:07.944 --> 00:20:09.024
What?

00:20:10.344 --> 00:20:13.224
You know, for the longest
time, I dreamed about

00:20:13.784 --> 00:20:17.104
coming overseas and
being on the front lines,

00:20:17.424 --> 00:20:18.944
serving my country.

00:20:19.784 --> 00:20:21.784
I finally got
everything I wanted

00:20:25.264 --> 00:20:26.384
and I'm wearing tights.

00:20:34.944 --> 00:20:36.464
They look like they've
been through hell.

00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:38.504
These men more than most.

00:20:42.304 --> 00:20:45.784
Schmidt sent out
a force to Azzano.

00:20:45.824 --> 00:20:47.304
Two hundred men
went up against him,

00:20:48.144 --> 00:20:50.304
and less than 50 returned.

00:20:51.184 --> 00:20:53.624
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

00:20:54.464 --> 00:20:56.384
The rest were
killed or captured.

00:20:56.544 --> 00:20:58.184
The 107th?

00:20:58.264 --> 00:20:59.264
What?

00:20:59.704 --> 00:21:01.064
Come on.

00:21:02.144 --> 00:21:03.144
Colonel Phillips.

00:21:03.184 --> 00:21:05.064
Well, if it isn't the
Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.

00:21:05.144 --> 00:21:06.464
What's your plan today?

00:21:06.584 --> 00:21:07.784
I need the casualty
list from Azzano.

00:21:07.824 --> 00:21:09.144
You don't get to
give me orders, son.

00:21:09.224 --> 00:21:12.424
I just need one name, Sergeant
James Barnes from the 107th.

00:21:12.984 --> 00:21:15.504
You and I are gonna have a
conversation later that you won't enjoy.

00:21:15.584 --> 00:21:17.446
Please tell me if
he's alive, sir. B-A-R...

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.704
I can spell.

00:21:24.704 --> 00:21:27.184
I have signed more of these
condolence letters today

00:21:27.264 --> 00:21:29.224
than I would care to count.

00:21:29.504 --> 00:21:31.624
But the name
does sound familiar.

00:21:32.184 --> 00:21:33.264
I'm sorry.

00:21:37.424 --> 00:21:39.904
What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?

00:21:40.184 --> 00:21:41.504
Yes, it's called
"winning the war."

00:21:43.024 --> 00:21:44.584
But if you know where
they are, why not at least...

00:21:44.664 --> 00:21:46.384
They're 30 miles
behind the lines

00:21:46.544 --> 00:21:49.304
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

00:21:49.344 --> 00:21:50.864
We'd lose more
men than we'd save.

00:21:50.944 --> 00:21:53.664
But I don't expect you to understand
that because you're a chorus girl.

00:21:55.864 --> 00:21:57.344
I think I understand just fine.

00:21:57.824 --> 00:21:59.504
Well, then understand
it somewhere else.

00:21:59.784 --> 00:22:04.064
If I read the posters correctly, you
got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

00:22:08.864 --> 00:22:11.544
Yes, sir. I do.

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:20.624
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

00:22:23.864 --> 00:22:25.744
What do you plan to do,
walk to Austria?

00:22:25.864 --> 00:22:27.224
If that's what it takes.

00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:29.424
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.

00:22:29.544 --> 00:22:30.544
You don't know that.

00:22:30.584 --> 00:22:32.584
Even so, he's devising a strategy.
If he detects...

00:22:32.664 --> 00:22:35.504
By the time he's done
that, it could be too late.

00:22:35.584 --> 00:22:36.624
Steve!

00:22:43.104 --> 00:22:45.904
You told me you thought I
was meant for more than this.

00:22:45.944 --> 00:22:47.224
Did you mean that?

00:22:48.864 --> 00:22:50.224
Every word.

00:22:51.904 --> 00:22:52.944
Then you got to let me go.

00:22:56.504 --> 00:22:58.344
I can do more than that.

00:22:58.704 --> 00:23:01.744
On stage, girls. Five minutes!

00:23:03.184 --> 00:23:04.464
Where's my helmet?

00:23:04.544 --> 00:23:05.984
Anyone seen Rogers?

00:23:09.904 --> 00:23:11.944
<i>The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,</i>

00:23:11.984 --> 00:23:13.984
tucked between these
two mountain ranges.

00:23:14.064 --> 00:23:15.144
It's a factory of some kind.

00:23:15.224 --> 00:23:17.504
We should be able to drop
you right on the doorstep.

00:23:17.584 --> 00:23:19.264
Just get me as close as you can.

00:23:19.384 --> 00:23:21.064
You two are gonna be in a
lot of trouble when you land.

00:23:21.104 --> 00:23:22.104
And you won't?

00:23:22.224 --> 00:23:24.704
Where I'm going, if anybody
yells at me, I can just shoot them.

00:23:24.784 --> 00:23:26.464
They will undoubtedly
shoot back.

00:23:26.504 --> 00:23:28.504
Well, let's hope it's
good for something.

00:23:28.584 --> 00:23:29.624
Agent Carter?

00:23:29.704 --> 00:23:31.064
If we're not in too
much of a hurry,

00:23:31.144 --> 00:23:34.664
I thought we could stop off in
Lucerne for a late-night fondue.

00:23:39.944 --> 00:23:42.784
Stark is the best civilian
pilot I've ever seen.

00:23:42.984 --> 00:23:45.464
He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.

00:23:47.224 --> 00:23:49.024
So, are you two... Do you...

00:23:51.424 --> 00:23:52.624
...fondue?

00:23:53.784 --> 00:23:55.984
This is your transponder.
Activate it when you're ready

00:23:56.064 --> 00:23:58.504
and the signal will
lead us straight to you.

00:23:59.584 --> 00:24:01.504
Are you sure this thing works?

00:24:01.544 --> 00:24:03.824
It's been tested
more than you, pal.

00:24:08.944 --> 00:24:11.504
Get back here!
We're taking you all the way in!

00:24:13.304 --> 00:24:16.304
As soon as I'm clear, you turn this
thing around and get the hell out of here!

00:24:16.504 --> 00:24:18.504
You can't give me orders!

00:24:18.784 --> 00:24:21.464
The hell I can't!
I'm a Captain!

00:24:39.659 --> 00:24:40.779
Tony?

00:24:43.419 --> 00:24:44.499
Tony?

00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:47.419
Tony?

00:24:49.499 --> 00:24:50.659
Tony?

00:24:53.339 --> 00:24:54.419
Tony!

00:24:56.619 --> 00:24:58.899
Tony! You okay?

00:24:59.259 --> 00:25:00.979
Where's Pepper?

00:25:01.019 --> 00:25:02.899
She's fine.
She's with five agents.

00:25:02.979 --> 00:25:05.299
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

00:25:05.419 --> 00:25:07.499
That's not going to be enough.

00:25:31.379 --> 00:25:37.379
Section 16.
Section 16. There it is.

00:25:46.379 --> 00:25:49.059
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

00:25:49.139 --> 00:25:51.299
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

00:25:51.419 --> 00:25:52.819
It's, like, a thing that's
going to pick the lock?

00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:55.619
You might want to
take a few steps back.

00:26:14.219 --> 00:26:16.739
That's the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

00:26:16.779 --> 00:26:19.579
Not bad, huh?
Let's do it.

00:26:26.259 --> 00:26:28.659
You need me to do anything else?

00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:31.059
Keep the skies clear.

00:26:36.179 --> 00:26:37.459
Damn!

00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:47.179
Next time, baby.

00:27:19.495 --> 00:27:20.655
Fellas.

00:27:21.175 --> 00:27:22.175
Ah!

00:28:21.553 --> 00:28:25.993
As you can see, production of the
<i>Valkyrie</i> is progressing on schedule,

00:28:26.113 --> 00:28:28.433
even with components
of this size.

00:28:28.713 --> 00:28:31.433
Increase the output by 60%

00:28:31.713 --> 00:28:35.393
and see to it our other
facilities do the same.

00:28:35.873 --> 00:28:40.233
But these prisoners, I'm not
sure they have the strength.

00:28:40.553 --> 00:28:43.553
Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.

00:28:44.073 --> 00:28:46.913
There are always more workers.

00:28:48.913 --> 00:28:50.073
Not now!

00:29:05.433 --> 00:29:07.273
You know, Fritz,

00:29:08.273 --> 00:29:10.593
one of these days, I'm
gonna have a stick of my own.

00:30:21.239 --> 00:30:22.559
Who are you supposed to be?

00:30:22.879 --> 00:30:26.199
I'm Captain America.

00:30:27.439 --> 00:30:28.919
I beg your pardon?

00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:34.119
What, are we taking everybody?

00:30:34.439 --> 00:30:36.079
I'm from Fresno, Ace.

00:30:36.239 --> 00:30:38.999
Is there anybody else? I'm looking
for a Sergeant James Barnes.

00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:40.719
There's an isolation
ward in the factory,

00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:42.279
but no one's ever
come back from it.

00:30:42.359 --> 00:30:43.479
All right.

00:30:43.559 --> 00:30:45.639
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.

00:30:45.719 --> 00:30:47.959
Get out fast and give 'em hell.

00:30:47.999 --> 00:30:49.759
I'll meet you guys in the
clearing with anybody else I find.

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:52.359
Wait. You know
what you're doing?

00:30:52.479 --> 00:30:55.319
Yeah. I've knocked out
Adolf Hitler over 200 times.

00:31:24.894 --> 00:31:28.254
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

00:31:28.854 --> 00:31:30.854
I thought it'd be bigger.

00:32:15.574 --> 00:32:16.814
Take him out!

00:32:27.614 --> 00:32:29.614
How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?

00:32:29.654 --> 00:32:31.974
<i>The suit's at 48%
power and falling, sir.</i>

00:32:32.054 --> 00:32:34.774
<i>That chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.</i>

00:32:34.814 --> 00:32:36.374
Keep me posted.

00:32:38.134 --> 00:32:39.174
<i>Pepper!</i>

00:32:39.174 --> 00:32:40.694
Tony! Tony, are you okay?

00:32:40.774 --> 00:32:42.254
<i>I'm fine. How are...</i>

00:32:42.334 --> 00:32:44.254
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
<i>- I know.</i>

00:32:44.334 --> 00:32:46.134
<i>- Listen, you'd better get out of there.</i>
- He built a suit.

00:32:46.174 --> 00:32:47.654
<i>Get out of there right now!</i>

00:32:59.494 --> 00:33:01.854
Where do you think you're going?

00:33:07.334 --> 00:33:10.334
Your services are
no longer required.

00:33:10.534 --> 00:33:12.014
Stane!

00:33:37.214 --> 00:33:38.894
I love this suit!

00:33:38.974 --> 00:33:40.054
Put them down!

00:33:40.094 --> 00:33:42.094
Collateral damage, Tony.

00:33:43.734 --> 00:33:45.814
Divert power to chest RT.

00:33:54.534 --> 00:33:56.654
Power reduced to 19%.

00:34:04.494 --> 00:34:05.574
Lady!

00:34:07.494 --> 00:34:09.534
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:34:31.614 --> 00:34:34.574
For 30 years, I've
been holding you up!

00:34:39.014 --> 00:34:41.454
I built this company
from nothing!

00:34:43.734 --> 00:34:46.294
Nothing is going
to stand in my way.

00:34:52.494 --> 00:34:54.934
Least of all you!

00:35:04.494 --> 00:35:07.814
Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!

00:35:08.334 --> 00:35:11.094
I've made some
upgrades of my own!

00:35:19.454 --> 00:35:21.414
<i>Sir, it appears
that his suit can fly.</i>

00:35:21.494 --> 00:35:23.134
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

00:35:23.254 --> 00:35:25.534
<i>With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...</i>

00:35:25.614 --> 00:35:27.774
I know the math! Do it!

00:35:36.054 --> 00:35:38.374
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

00:35:38.454 --> 00:35:41.094
Get me Major Allen.
Scramble the jets!

00:35:43.814 --> 00:35:46.814
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

00:35:46.854 --> 00:35:48.134
Yes, sir.

00:36:11.377 --> 00:36:13.137
You know how to use that thing?

00:36:17.097 --> 00:36:18.097
Okay.

00:36:20.377 --> 00:36:21.897
What is happening?

00:36:30.177 --> 00:36:32.217
Hey. Not exactly a Buick.

00:36:33.657 --> 00:36:35.617
- That one. "Zundung."
- Zundung?

00:36:36.537 --> 00:36:37.537
Get this thing going, Dugan!

00:36:37.577 --> 00:36:38.937
I didn't know you spoke German.

00:36:39.017 --> 00:36:42.257
Three semesters at Howard,
switched to French, girls much cuter.

00:36:42.337 --> 00:36:43.337
Didn't ask for the resume.

00:36:56.097 --> 00:36:57.457
On your left! Up top!

00:37:15.057 --> 00:37:17.417
No, no! What are you doing?

00:37:18.457 --> 00:37:21.457
Our forces are outmatched.

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:48.817
Keep moving!
Grab those grenades!

00:38:28.377 --> 00:38:31.457
Sergeant.
Three-two-five-five-seven.

00:38:32.537 --> 00:38:33.537
Bucky?

00:38:34.617 --> 00:38:35.617
Oh, my God.

00:38:40.697 --> 00:38:42.217
- Is that...
- It's me.

00:38:42.417 --> 00:38:44.297
- It's Steve.
- Steve?

00:38:44.377 --> 00:38:45.817
- Come on.
- Steve.

00:38:49.977 --> 00:38:51.137
I thought you were dead.

00:38:52.057 --> 00:38:53.417
I thought you were smaller.

00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:02.377
Come on.

00:39:04.817 --> 00:39:07.657
- What happened to you?
- I joined the Army.

00:39:13.977 --> 00:39:16.057
- Did it hurt?
- A little.

00:39:16.497 --> 00:39:17.817
Is this permanent?

00:39:17.977 --> 00:39:19.057
So far.

00:39:49.097 --> 00:39:50.777
Captain America!

00:39:50.977 --> 00:39:52.657
How exciting!

00:39:53.137 --> 00:39:56.137
I am a great fan of your films!

00:39:57.817 --> 00:40:01.817
So, Dr. Erskine
managed it after all.

00:40:02.137 --> 00:40:03.977
Not exactly an improvement,

00:40:04.057 --> 00:40:07.417
but still, impressive.

00:40:10.177 --> 00:40:11.657
You've got no idea.

00:40:14.737 --> 00:40:15.817
Haven't I?

00:40:31.497 --> 00:40:34.537
No matter what lies
Erskine told you,

00:40:34.777 --> 00:40:37.977
you see, I was his
greatest success!

00:40:51.457 --> 00:40:53.297
You don't have one
of those, do you?

00:40:53.537 --> 00:40:55.897
You are deluded, Captain.

00:40:56.537 --> 00:40:59.217
You pretend to
be a simple soldier,

00:40:59.297 --> 00:41:01.737
but in reality,
you are just afraid

00:41:01.817 --> 00:41:05.457
to admit that we have
left humanity behind.

00:41:07.217 --> 00:41:09.977
Unlike you, I
embrace it proudly.

00:41:11.137 --> 00:41:12.217
Without fear!

00:41:12.457 --> 00:41:13.817
Then how come you're running?

00:41:25.857 --> 00:41:27.937
Come on, let's go. Up.

00:41:30.857 --> 00:41:33.257
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

00:41:36.737 --> 00:41:38.097
What about me?

00:41:38.297 --> 00:41:40.137
Where will I sit?

00:41:40.697 --> 00:41:42.457
Not a scratch, Doctor.

00:41:42.577 --> 00:41:44.097
Not a scratch.

00:42:17.137 --> 00:42:19.337
Let's go. One at a time.

00:42:47.977 --> 00:42:50.977
- Gotta be a rope or something!
- Just go! Get out of here!

00:42:51.057 --> 00:42:52.457
No! Not without you!

00:42:53.377 --> 00:42:54.697
Hell.

00:43:19.213 --> 00:43:21.173
<i>- Thirteen percent power, sir.</i>
- Climb!

00:43:25.173 --> 00:43:27.173
<i>- Eleven percent.</i>
- Keep going!

00:43:33.933 --> 00:43:36.053
<i>- Seven percent power.</i>
- Just leave it on the screen!

00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:37.733
Stop telling me!

00:43:47.413 --> 00:43:52.053
You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!

00:43:52.573 --> 00:43:54.653
How'd you solve
the icing problem?

00:43:54.693 --> 00:43:56.213
Icing problem?

00:43:58.413 --> 00:44:00.813
Might want to look into it.

00:44:12.493 --> 00:44:13.773
<i>Two percent.</i>

00:44:15.893 --> 00:44:18.413
<i>We are now running on
emergency backup power.</i>

00:44:18.493 --> 00:44:19.493
Whoa!

00:44:30.413 --> 00:44:33.933
- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

00:44:33.973 --> 00:44:38.133
I'm almost out of power. I've got to
get out of this thing. I'll be right there.

00:44:38.213 --> 00:44:39.573
Nice try!

00:44:52.173 --> 00:44:54.013
Weapons status?

00:44:54.093 --> 00:44:56.333
<i>Repulsors offline.
Missiles offline.</i>

00:45:00.573 --> 00:45:02.093
Flares!

00:45:10.613 --> 00:45:12.693
Very clever, Tony.

00:45:18.013 --> 00:45:20.493
Potts? Tony!

00:45:20.573 --> 00:45:21.573
This isn't working.

00:45:21.613 --> 00:45:23.973
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

00:45:24.013 --> 00:45:25.453
Well, how are you
going to do that?

00:45:25.493 --> 00:45:26.933
You're going to do it.

00:45:26.973 --> 00:45:29.453
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

00:45:29.533 --> 00:45:30.973
When I get clear of
the roof, I'll let you know.

00:45:31.013 --> 00:45:33.653
You're going to hit the
master bypass button.

00:45:33.693 --> 00:45:35.093
It's going to fry
everything up here.

00:45:37.293 --> 00:45:39.573
Okay. I'm going in now.

00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:42.893
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

00:45:52.413 --> 00:45:54.213
This looks important!

00:46:15.093 --> 00:46:17.893
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,

00:46:17.973 --> 00:46:22.093
but I must admit, I'm
deeply enjoying the suit!

00:46:30.373 --> 00:46:32.853
You finally outdid
yourself, Tony!

00:46:35.213 --> 00:46:37.373
You'd have made
your father proud!

00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:44.853
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!

00:47:04.373 --> 00:47:05.693
Tony!

00:47:06.893 --> 00:47:08.533
How ironic, Tony!

00:47:10.333 --> 00:47:12.693
Trying to rid the
world of weapons,

00:47:13.133 --> 00:47:15.413
you gave it its best one ever!

00:47:15.453 --> 00:47:21.373
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

00:47:24.413 --> 00:47:26.733
You ripped out my
targeting system!

00:47:26.773 --> 00:47:28.253
Time to hit the button!

00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:30.253
You told me not to!

00:47:30.413 --> 00:47:32.333
Hold still, you little prick!

00:47:34.373 --> 00:47:35.653
Just do it!

00:47:35.733 --> 00:47:36.933
You'll die!

00:47:40.053 --> 00:47:41.573
Push it!

00:48:39.133 --> 00:48:40.893
Tony!

00:48:53.125 --> 00:48:56.485
Senator Brandt,
I regret to report that

00:48:56.565 --> 00:49:01.405
Captain Steven G. Rogers went
missing behind enemy lines on the third.

00:49:01.445 --> 00:49:03.645
Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.

00:49:03.725 --> 00:49:07.725
As a result, I must
declare Captain Rogers

00:49:08.565 --> 00:49:10.725
killed in action. Period.

00:49:14.725 --> 00:49:16.485
The last surveillance
flight is back.

00:49:18.885 --> 00:49:20.885
No sign of activity.

00:49:21.645 --> 00:49:24.445
- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

00:49:27.085 --> 00:49:28.245
I can't touch Stark.

00:49:28.325 --> 00:49:31.165
He's rich and he's the Army's
number one weapons contractor.

00:49:31.245 --> 00:49:32.765
You are neither one.

00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:35.325
With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:37.125
And I don't think Captain
Rogers did, either.

00:49:37.165 --> 00:49:40.005
What makes you think I give
a damn about your opinions?

00:49:40.085 --> 00:49:41.925
I took a chance with
you, Agent Carter.

00:49:41.965 --> 00:49:45.565
And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead

00:49:45.645 --> 00:49:46.645
'cause you had a crush.

00:49:46.725 --> 00:49:49.085
It wasn't that. I had faith.

00:49:49.605 --> 00:49:51.405
Well, I hope that's
a big comfort to you

00:49:51.485 --> 00:49:54.165
when they shut
this division down.

00:49:56.685 --> 00:49:58.005
What the hell's
going on out there?

00:50:40.925 --> 00:50:42.725
Look who it is!

00:51:09.885 --> 00:51:12.045
Some of these men
need medical attention.

00:51:12.085 --> 00:51:14.045
- Medic, we got wounded.
- Right over here.

00:51:14.085 --> 00:51:16.725
I'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.

00:51:18.085 --> 00:51:19.765
That won't be necessary.

00:51:23.605 --> 00:51:24.885
Yes, sir.

00:51:26.405 --> 00:51:27.885
Faith, huh?

00:51:34.323 --> 00:51:35.603
You're late.

00:51:39.725 --> 00:51:41.445
Couldn't call my ride.

00:51:43.381 --> 00:51:44.861
Hey!

00:51:45.303 --> 00:51:46.983
Let's hear it for
Captain America!

00:52:04.085 --> 00:52:07.445
<i>I am honored to present
this medal for valor</i>

00:52:07.525 --> 00:52:11.205
to my personal friend,
Captain America!

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.280
Captain America!

00:52:16.732 --> 00:52:18.732
Captain, that's your cue!

00:52:22.569 --> 00:52:24.507
I thought he'd be taller.

00:52:24.804 --> 00:52:26.924
<i>You've all received the official
statement of what occurred</i>

00:52:26.964 --> 00:52:29.324
<i>at Stark Industries last night.</i>

00:52:29.644 --> 00:52:34.164
<i>There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned</i>

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:36.844
<i>and caused damage
to the arc reactor.</i>

00:52:37.604 --> 00:52:39.884
<i>Fortunately, a member of Tony
Stark's personal security staff...</i>

00:52:39.964 --> 00:52:41.884
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

00:52:41.964 --> 00:52:43.444
I mean, it's not
technically accurate.

00:52:43.484 --> 00:52:45.644
The suit's a
gold-titanium alloy,

00:52:45.644 --> 00:52:48.324
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

00:52:48.404 --> 00:52:50.044
Here's your alibi.

00:52:50.924 --> 00:52:52.004
Okay.

00:52:52.084 --> 00:52:54.244
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

00:52:54.324 --> 00:52:56.484
We have port papers that
put you in Avalon all night,

00:52:56.524 --> 00:52:58.244
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

00:52:58.364 --> 00:53:01.484
See, I was thinking maybe we
should say it was just Pepper and me

00:53:01.524 --> 00:53:03.364
alone on the island.

00:53:04.644 --> 00:53:05.924
- That's what happened.
- All right.

00:53:06.004 --> 00:53:08.124
Just read it, word for word.

00:53:10.004 --> 00:53:12.044
There's nothing
about Stane here.

00:53:12.164 --> 00:53:14.924
That's being handled.
He's on vacation.

00:53:15.804 --> 00:53:18.284
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

00:53:18.364 --> 00:53:20.844
But what about the whole
cover story that it's a bodyguard?

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:23.884
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

00:53:23.924 --> 00:53:26.244
This isn't my first
rodeo, Mr. Stark.

00:53:26.324 --> 00:53:27.644
Just stick to the
official statement,

00:53:27.724 --> 00:53:30.324
and soon, this will
all be behind you.

00:53:30.364 --> 00:53:32.684
You've got 90 seconds.

00:53:35.124 --> 00:53:36.804
Oh, Agent Coulson?

00:53:37.884 --> 00:53:42.404
I just wanted to say thank you
very much for all of your help.

00:53:42.444 --> 00:53:45.404
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

00:53:45.644 --> 00:53:47.244
From the Strategic Homeland...

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:48.924
Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:53:49.364 --> 00:53:50.524
Right.

00:53:51.484 --> 00:53:53.004
Let's get this show on the road.

00:53:53.084 --> 00:53:55.404
You know, it's
actually not that bad.

00:53:55.444 --> 00:53:57.724
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

00:53:57.844 --> 00:53:59.404
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

00:53:59.484 --> 00:54:01.964
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

00:54:02.044 --> 00:54:06.044
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

00:54:06.084 --> 00:54:07.564
She'd be a wreck, 'cause
she'd always be worrying

00:54:07.604 --> 00:54:08.684
that I was going to die,

00:54:08.764 --> 00:54:11.124
yet so proud of
the man I'd become.

00:54:11.204 --> 00:54:14.924
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

00:54:16.644 --> 00:54:17.724
crazy about me.

00:54:17.764 --> 00:54:19.484
Tell me you never
think about that night.

00:54:19.564 --> 00:54:21.444
- What night?
- You know.

00:54:24.364 --> 00:54:30.084
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

00:54:31.764 --> 00:54:37.364
and then you went
downstairs to get me a drink,

00:54:37.444 --> 00:54:40.684
and you left me
there, by myself?

00:54:41.884 --> 00:54:44.444
Is that the night
you're talking about?

00:54:44.524 --> 00:54:45.524
Mmm-hmm.

00:54:46.604 --> 00:54:47.724
Thought so.

00:54:50.404 --> 00:54:54.164
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

00:54:54.244 --> 00:54:57.804
And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

00:54:57.844 --> 00:55:00.924
He will not be taking
any questions. Thank you.

00:55:05.084 --> 00:55:07.484
Been a while since
I was in front of you.

00:55:07.524 --> 00:55:09.124
I figure I'll stick to
the cards this time.

00:55:12.124 --> 00:55:15.244
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

00:55:15.324 --> 00:55:16.604
on the freeway
and the rooftop...

00:55:16.644 --> 00:55:19.484
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

00:55:19.524 --> 00:55:23.324
that was a bodyguard in a
suit that conveniently appeared,

00:55:23.364 --> 00:55:26.484
- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

00:55:26.564 --> 00:55:30.204
It is one thing to question the
official story, and another thing entirely

00:55:30.284 --> 00:55:33.524
to make wild accusations, or
insinuate that I'm a superhero.

00:55:33.644 --> 00:55:35.244
I never said you
were a superhero.

00:55:35.324 --> 00:55:36.324
- Didn't?
- Mmm-mmm.

00:55:36.364 --> 00:55:40.684
Well, good, because that
would be outlandish and fantastic.

00:55:42.684 --> 00:55:45.924
I'm just not the hero type.
Clearly.

00:55:46.484 --> 00:55:49.524
With this laundry list
of character defects,

00:55:49.604 --> 00:55:50.964
all the mistakes I've made,

00:55:51.004 --> 00:55:52.644
largely public.

00:55:52.764 --> 00:55:54.404
<i>Just stick to the cards, man.</i>

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:56.124
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

00:55:58.244 --> 00:55:59.764
The truth is

00:56:05.964 --> 00:56:07.404
I am Iron Man.
