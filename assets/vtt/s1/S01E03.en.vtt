00:01:49.747 --> 00:01:53.126
Notes. Main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:54.975
Hull pressurization is problematic.

00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:57.589
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

00:01:57.672 --> 00:01:59.823
<i>A very astute observation, sir.</i>

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:01.696
<i>Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets…</i>

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:03.303
<i>we should improve the exosystems.</i>

00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:05.972
Connect to the sys. Co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:09.142
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

00:02:09.225 --> 00:02:11.019
That should ensure a fuselage integrity…

00:02:11.102 --> 00:02:13.104
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

00:02:13.187 --> 00:02:14.439
- Got it?
- <i>Yes.</i>

00:02:14.522 --> 00:02:16.826
<i>Shall I render using
proposed specifications?</i>

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:17.984
Thrill me.

00:02:19.694 --> 00:02:21.821
<i>Tonight's red-hot red carpet…</i>

00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:24.241
<i>is right here at the Disney Concert Hall…</i>

00:02:24.324 --> 00:02:26.618
<i>where Tony Stark's third annual benefit…</i>

00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:28.523
<i>for the Firefighter's Family Fund…</i>

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:30.205
<i>has become the place to be…</i>

00:02:30.288 --> 00:02:31.581
- …<i>for L.A.'s high society.</i>
- Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

00:02:31.664 --> 00:02:34.125
<i>I have no record of an invitation, sir.</i>

00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:35.665
<i>…hasn't been seen in public…</i>

00:02:35.748 --> 00:02:39.542
<i>since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.</i>

00:02:39.714 --> 00:02:42.342
<i>Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress…</i>

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:44.527
<i>and has been bedridden for weeks.</i>

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.471
<i>Whatever the case may be…</i>

00:02:46.554 --> 00:02:49.309
<i>no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.</i>

00:02:49.392 --> 00:02:51.507
<i>The render is complete.</i>

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.220
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

00:02:53.303 --> 00:02:56.075
<i>What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.</i>

00:02:58.063 --> 00:02:59.130
Tell you what.

00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:00.675
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:03.248
<i>Yes, that should help
you keep a low profile.</i>

00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:08.701
<i>The render is complete.</i>

00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:11.162
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it.
Paint it.

00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:12.831
<i>Commencing automated assembly.</i>

00:03:12.914 --> 00:03:16.084
<i>Estimated completiontime
is five hours.</i>

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:17.588
Don't wait up for me, honey.

00:03:41.442 --> 00:03:45.197
Weapons manufacturing is only one
small part of what Stark Industries…

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.032
is all about, and our partnership.

00:03:47.115 --> 00:03:49.656
With the fire and rescue community…

00:03:51.786 --> 00:03:53.373
Hey, Tony, remember me?

00:03:53.456 --> 00:03:54.466
Sure don't.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.090
You look great, Hef.

00:03:59.127 --> 00:04:00.403
We're going to have a great quarter.

00:04:00.486 --> 00:04:03.262
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:05.980
Look at you.

00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:08.473
Hey, what a surprise.

00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:09.757
I'll see you inside.

00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:11.947
Hey.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.251
Listen, take it slow, alright?

00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:15.979
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

00:04:16.062 --> 00:04:18.663
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

00:04:48.928 --> 00:04:50.636
That's no satellite crash!

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:51.890
They would have hauled
the wreckage away…

00:04:51.973 --> 00:04:53.866
they wouldn't have built
a city around it.

00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:57.029
- You're going to need this.
- What?

00:04:57.403 --> 00:04:58.742
Wait, why?

00:05:01.917 --> 00:05:03.195
Now stay here.

00:05:03.644 --> 00:05:04.711
Once I have Mjolnir…

00:05:04.794 --> 00:05:06.964
I will return the items
they've stolen from you.

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:08.499
Deal?

00:05:08.781 --> 00:05:09.771
No.

00:05:09.854 --> 00:05:11.076
Look what's down there.

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.037
You think you're just gonna walk in,
grab our stuff and walk out?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.278
No. I'm going to fly out.

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:27.169
Sir, feed from the keyhole
can barely penetrate the cloud cover.

00:05:27.252 --> 00:05:28.468
Tech's barely working as it is…

00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:30.945
with all the interference
that thing's giving off.

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.671
And we've got a commercial aircraft
coming right over us.

00:05:33.754 --> 00:05:36.768
Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.

00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:38.391
Reroute it like all the others.

00:05:39.287 --> 00:05:40.355
Hold a sec.

00:05:40.438 --> 00:05:41.848
We've got something
outside the fence…

00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:43.127
west side.

00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:44.394
<i>Delancey, Jackson.</i>

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.775
<i>West side perimeter.
Go check it out.</i>

00:05:49.322 --> 00:05:50.636
There it is.

00:05:59.457 --> 00:06:01.140
Delancey, Jackson. Report.

00:06:09.384 --> 00:06:11.607
<i>Agent down.
We've got a perimeter breach.</i>

00:06:28.528 --> 00:06:30.075
Think you got enough?

00:06:31.788 --> 00:06:35.800
Any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code.

00:06:36.436 --> 00:06:38.902
But without Dr. Erskine,
it would take years.

00:06:40.407 --> 00:06:42.167
He deserved more than this.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.842
If it could work only once,
he'd be proud it was you.

00:06:50.023 --> 00:06:53.103
Colonel Phillips,
my committee is demanding answers.

00:06:53.186 --> 00:06:53.929
Great.

00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:56.013
Why don't we start with
how a German spy got a ride…

00:06:56.096 --> 00:06:58.307
to my secret installation in your car?

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.506
What have we got here?

00:06:59.724 --> 00:07:02.980
Speaking modestly, I am the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

00:07:03.063 --> 00:07:04.838
But I don't know what's
inside this thing…

00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:06.209
or how it works.

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:07.848
We're not even close to this technology.

00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:09.874
Then who is?
Hydra.

00:07:10.105 --> 00:07:12.032
I am sure you have been
reading our briefings.

00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:14.096
I am on a number
of committees, Colonel.

00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:16.392
Hydra is the Nazi deep science division.

00:07:16.475 --> 00:07:17.991
It's led by Johann Schmidt.

00:07:18.074 --> 00:07:20.023
But he has much bigger ambitions.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.379
Hydra is practically a cult.

00:07:21.462 --> 00:07:23.367
They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.067
So, what are you going to do about it?

00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:27.337
I spoke to the President this morning.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.058
As of today, the SSR is being retasked.

00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:30.556
Colonel?

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:33.992
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, agent Carter.

00:07:34.075 --> 00:07:35.493
You too Stark.

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:37.416
We're flying to London tonight.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:38.489
Sir?

00:07:38.572 --> 00:07:40.009
If you're going after Schmidt, I want in.

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:42.360
You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.

00:07:42.692 --> 00:07:43.669
The serum worked.

00:07:43.752 --> 00:07:46.056
I asked for an army and all I got was you.

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:47.243
You…

00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:49.282
are not enough.

00:07:52.912 --> 00:07:54.801
With all due respect to the Colonel…

00:07:54.884 --> 00:07:56.967
I think we may be missing the point.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.156
I have seen you in action, Steve.

00:07:59.239 --> 00:08:00.439
More importantly…

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:01.638
the country's seen it.

00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:02.899
Paper.

00:08:03.914 --> 00:08:07.804
The enlistment lines have been around the
block since your picture hit the newsstands.

00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:09.451
You don't take a soldier…

00:08:09.534 --> 00:08:11.447
a symbol like that and…

00:08:11.664 --> 00:08:13.411
hide him in a lab.

00:08:13.953 --> 00:08:14.976
Son…

00:08:15.605 --> 00:08:17.747
do you want to serve your country…

00:08:17.946 --> 00:08:21.258
on the most important battlefield of the war?

00:08:22.142 --> 00:08:23.171
Sir…

00:08:23.427 --> 00:08:24.661
that's all I want.

00:08:24.744 --> 00:08:26.676
Then, congratulations.

00:08:27.003 --> 00:08:28.816
You just got promoted.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.962
Give me a Scotch.
I'm starving.

00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:38.045
Mr. Stark?

00:08:38.414 --> 00:08:40.490
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

00:08:40.573 --> 00:08:42.700
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the…

00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:46.298
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

00:08:46.381 --> 00:08:47.880
God, you need a new name for that.

00:08:47.963 --> 00:08:49.627
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

00:08:50.766 --> 00:08:52.928
Listen, I know this must be
a trying time for you but…

00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:54.639
we need to debrief you.

00:08:54.722 --> 00:08:56.272
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions…

00:08:56.355 --> 00:08:58.437
and time can be a factor
with these things.

00:08:58.715 --> 00:09:00.597
Let's just put something on the books.

00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:04.180
How about the 24th at 7:00 P.M.
at Stark Industries?

00:09:04.563 --> 00:09:05.653
Tell you what.

00:09:05.736 --> 00:09:07.868
You got it. You're absolutely right.

00:09:08.017 --> 00:09:09.115
Well…

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:12.544
I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

00:09:13.783 --> 00:09:15.829
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:18.246
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

00:09:18.329 --> 00:09:20.423
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:21.940
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

00:09:22.023 --> 00:09:24.211
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:25.372
Yes.

00:09:25.628 --> 00:09:27.469
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

00:09:27.552 --> 00:09:29.281
- Alright, come on.
- Thank you. No.

00:09:40.442 --> 00:09:42.230
Am I making you uncomfortable?

00:09:43.188 --> 00:09:44.558
No. No.

00:09:44.947 --> 00:09:48.443
I always forget to wear deodorant
and dance with my boss…

00:09:48.526 --> 00:09:52.008
in front of everyone that I work
with in a dress with no back.

00:09:52.655 --> 00:09:53.782
You look great and you smell great.

00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:55.108
Oh, God.

00:09:55.191 --> 00:09:57.160
But I could fire you if that
would take the edge off.

00:09:57.243 --> 00:10:00.839
I actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.

00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:02.248
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:04.234
What's your Social Security number?

00:10:08.463 --> 00:10:10.473
- Five.
- Five?

00:10:11.049 --> 00:10:12.342
- Right.
- Right.

00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:14.823
You're missing just a couple of digits there.

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.016
- The other eight?
- Yes.

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:18.755
So I got you for the other eight.

00:10:30.652 --> 00:10:33.120
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

00:10:35.615 --> 00:10:37.534
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

00:10:37.617 --> 00:10:40.579
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

00:10:40.662 --> 00:10:42.083
- We're dancing. No one's even watching.
- Everybody…

00:10:42.166 --> 00:10:43.917
who I work with…
No, you know why?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.982
I think you lost objectivity.

00:10:45.065 --> 00:10:45.500
I think they just…

00:10:45.583 --> 00:10:47.082
- People… We just danced.
- I don't know…

00:10:47.165 --> 00:10:48.491
No, it was not just a dance.

00:10:48.574 --> 00:10:50.505
You don't understand
because you're you.

00:10:50.588 --> 00:10:53.425
And everybody knows
exactly who you are…

00:10:53.508 --> 00:10:56.761
and how you are with girls and all
of that, which is completely fine.

00:10:56.844 --> 00:10:59.638
But, you know then me,
you're my boss and I'm…

00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:00.875
- …dancing with you because…
- Please I don't think, I…

00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.515
- …it makes me look like…
- …really don't think it was taken that way.

00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:04.269
the one who's trying to…

00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:06.229
- …you know, and we're here…
- I just think you're overstating it.

00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:07.608
and then I'm…

00:11:08.546 --> 00:11:10.108
wearing this ridiculous…

00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:12.988
dress and then we were
dancing like that and…

00:11:26.916 --> 00:11:29.384
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, ok.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.348
I would like a vodka Martini, please.

00:11:33.431 --> 00:11:34.051
Ok.

00:11:34.134 --> 00:11:39.164
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:42.766
Two vodka Martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

00:11:42.849 --> 00:11:44.462
Make one of them dirty, will you?

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:52.526
Tony Stark.

00:11:52.609 --> 00:11:54.952
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

00:11:58.953 --> 00:11:59.986
- Carrie.
- Christine.

00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:01.107
That's right.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.474
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

00:12:03.953 --> 00:12:05.293
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

00:12:05.376 --> 00:12:06.196
Panic.

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:07.826
I would say panic is my reaction.

00:12:07.909 --> 00:12:09.334
Because I was referring
to your company's…

00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:10.752
involvement in this latest atrocity.

00:12:10.835 --> 00:12:12.225
Yeah. They just put my
name on the invitation.

00:12:12.308 --> 00:12:13.380
I don't know what to tell you.

00:12:13.463 --> 00:12:15.759
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

00:12:15.842 --> 00:12:17.592
I was out of town for a couple months…

00:12:17.675 --> 00:12:20.173
- …in case you didn't hear.
- Is this what you call accountability?

00:12:20.762 --> 00:12:22.109
It's a town called Gulmira.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.474
Heard of it?

00:12:34.956 --> 00:12:36.236
When were these taken?

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:37.695
Yesterday.

00:12:37.946 --> 00:12:39.948
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:41.825
Well, I'm not my company.

00:12:43.117 --> 00:12:44.246
Please, do you mind?

00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:45.848
Have you seen these pictures?

00:12:46.412 --> 00:12:47.747
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.293
You can't afford to be this naive.

00:12:49.376 --> 00:12:51.128
You know what?
I was naive before…

00:12:51.211 --> 00:12:52.919
when they said, here's the line.
We don't cross it.

00:12:53.002 --> 00:12:54.588
This is how we do business.

00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:56.858
If we're double-dealing under the table.

00:12:56.941 --> 00:12:58.014
Are we?

00:12:58.184 --> 00:12:59.556
Tony, your picture, please!

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.368
Let's take a picture. Come on.

00:13:05.101 --> 00:13:06.360
Picture time!

00:13:06.443 --> 00:13:07.637
Tony Stark! Sir!

00:13:09.394 --> 00:13:11.436
Who do you think locked you out?

00:13:11.688 --> 00:13:14.822
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:19.408
It was the only way I could protect you.

00:13:22.198 --> 00:13:23.749
No. No.

00:13:33.209 --> 00:13:34.211
I don't know if I can do this.

00:13:34.294 --> 00:13:38.135
Nothing to it. You sell a few bonds.
Bonds buy bullets. Bullets kill Nazis.

00:13:38.218 --> 00:13:39.401
Bing, bang, boom.

00:13:39.501 --> 00:13:41.048
You're an American hero.

00:13:41.346 --> 00:13:43.333
It's just not how I pictured getting there.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.281

<i>The 15-mile hike to the outskirts

<i>as a descent into hell…</i>

<i>into a modern day Heart of Darkness.</i>

00:17:36.696 --> 00:17:39.616
<i>Simple farmers and herders

<i>emboldened by a new found power.</i>

00:17:46.081 --> 00:17:48.076
<i>Villagers have been forced

00:17:48.159 --> 00:17:49.988
<i>in whatever crude dwellings
they can find…</i>

00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:51.920
<i>in the ruins of other villages…</i>

00:17:52.003 --> 00:17:55.806
<i>or here in the remnants of an

00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:04.099
<i>Recent violence has been attributed

<i>With no political will or

<i>A child's simple question…</i>

<i>Where are my mother and father?</i>

00:18:39.468 --> 00:18:41.887
<i>There's very little hope

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.993
<i>refugees who can only wonder,
who if anyone, will help.</i>

00:19:56.834 --> 00:19:59.207
<i>You've reached Dr Erik Selvig.</i>

Don't worry, I'm fine but…

00:20:05.321 --> 00:20:08.033
just in case you don't hear
from me in the next hour just…

00:20:08.116 --> 00:20:10.506
come by the crater site
and try and find me, ok?

00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:13.551
I did exactly what you told me not to.
I'm sorry.

00:20:13.676 --> 00:20:15.273
So sorry. Bye.

00:20:19.015 --> 00:20:20.485

<i>Target sighted, east tunnel!</i>

00:20:54.759 --> 00:20:56.897

00:21:31.502 --> 00:21:32.422

00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:35.216

00:21:37.259 --> 00:21:38.317

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.626

00:21:40.387 --> 00:21:42.314
You want me to slow him down, sir?

00:21:43.388 --> 00:21:45.530
Or are you sending in more guys

00:21:45.613 --> 00:21:47.200
I'll let you know.

00:22:02.034 --> 00:22:03.337
You're big.

00:22:04.453 --> 00:22:05.914
Fought bigger.

00:22:50.332 --> 00:22:52.046

00:22:52.192 --> 00:22:54.249

<i>He's all yours.</i>

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.623
- <i>What the hell was that?</i>
- Were we cleared to go in there?

00:26:15.706 --> 00:26:17.959
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

00:26:18.042 --> 00:26:19.919
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

00:26:20.002 --> 00:26:21.300
Get those monitors up!

00:26:21.532 --> 00:26:22.875
We got a bogey!

00:26:22.958 --> 00:26:25.133
Wasn't Air Force!
We got the CIA on the line?

00:26:25.216 --> 00:26:27.176
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

00:26:27.259 --> 00:26:28.928
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

00:26:29.011 --> 00:26:30.680
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

00:26:30.763 --> 00:26:33.266
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

00:26:33.349 --> 00:26:35.643
<i>Negative, negative.
Cannot identify.</i>

00:26:35.726 --> 00:26:38.426
Get me Colonel Rhodes from Weapons
Development down here now!

00:26:45.152 --> 00:26:46.849
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced…

00:26:46.932 --> 00:26:48.698
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:50.927
Any high altitude
surveillance in the region?

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.689
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

00:26:52.772 --> 00:26:54.495
So this thing just
appeared out of nowhere?

00:26:54.578 --> 00:26:55.955
How come it didn't
show up on the radar?

00:26:56.038 --> 00:26:57.999
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

00:26:58.082 --> 00:27:00.279
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

00:27:00.362 --> 00:27:02.493
We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.666
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

00:27:07.187 --> 00:27:09.646
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

00:27:13.681 --> 00:27:14.781
Hello?

00:27:14.864 --> 00:27:15.516
Tony?

00:27:15.599 --> 00:27:16.306
<i>Who's this?</i>

00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:17.518
It's Rhodes.

00:27:17.601 --> 00:27:19.645
- Sorry, hello?
- <i>I said it's Rhodes.</i>

00:27:19.728 --> 00:27:22.429
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.358
Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.

00:27:24.441 --> 00:27:26.071
Yeah well, I need your help right now.

00:27:26.154 --> 00:27:27.521
<i>It's funny how that works, huh?</i>

00:27:27.604 --> 00:27:30.151
Yeah. Speaking of funny,
we've got a weapons depot…

00:27:30.234 --> 00:27:32.784
that was just blown up a few clicks from
where you were being held captive.

00:27:32.867 --> 00:27:34.577
<i>Well, that's say, that's a hot spot.</i>

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.041
<i>Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you?</i>

00:27:37.124 --> 00:27:38.483
- Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?
- <i>I'm not.</i>

00:27:38.566 --> 00:27:39.601
<i>I was just jogging in the canyon.</i>

00:27:39.684 --> 00:27:41.417
- I thought you were driving.
- <i>Right, I was driving…</i>

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.213
<i>to the canyon,
where I'm going to jog.</i>

00:27:43.296 --> 00:27:45.713
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

00:27:45.796 --> 00:27:47.298
<i>Nope! Bogey spotted!</i>

00:27:47.381 --> 00:27:48.633
<i>Whiplash, come in hot.</i>

00:27:48.716 --> 00:27:50.610
Ok good, because I'm staring
at one right now…

00:27:50.693 --> 00:27:52.876
and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

00:27:54.297 --> 00:27:55.725
That's my exit.

00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:03.944
<i>Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.</i>

00:28:04.481 --> 00:28:05.900
Whiplash One, what is it?

00:28:05.983 --> 00:28:07.318
<i>I've got no idea.</i>

00:28:07.401 --> 00:28:08.402
You have radio contact?

00:28:08.485 --> 00:28:09.737
<i>Non responsive, sir.</i>

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.408
Then you are clear to engage.

00:28:12.948 --> 00:28:14.085
<i>Hit it.</i>

00:28:18.787 --> 00:28:20.054
<i>That bogey just went supersonic.</i>

00:28:20.137 --> 00:28:21.439
<i>I got a lock!</i>

00:28:25.739 --> 00:28:26.948
<i>Inbound missile.</i>

00:28:27.165 --> 00:28:28.333
<i>Flares!</i>

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:33.035
<i>Wait a second.
Bogey deployed flares!</i>

00:28:47.691 --> 00:28:48.967
Deploy flaps!

00:28:50.194 --> 00:28:51.321
Holy!

00:28:51.487 --> 00:28:52.955
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

00:28:53.038 --> 00:28:54.699
The sat visual has been lost.

00:28:54.782 --> 00:28:56.451
<i>No way that's a UAV.</i>

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:57.546
What is it?

00:28:57.629 --> 00:28:59.012
I can't see anything.

00:28:59.411 --> 00:29:01.646
<i>Whatever it was,
it just bought the farm.</i>

00:29:02.239 --> 00:29:04.162
<i>I think bogey's been handled, sir.</i>

00:29:14.343 --> 00:29:16.012
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Rhodey, it's me.</i>

00:29:16.095 --> 00:29:17.805
- It's who?
- <i>I'm sorry, it is me.</i>

00:29:17.888 --> 00:29:19.140
<i>You asked. What you were
asking about is me.</i>

00:29:19.223 --> 00:29:20.725
No, see, this isn't a game.

00:29:20.808 --> 00:29:24.145
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

00:29:24.228 --> 00:29:26.147
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.898
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

00:29:29.021 --> 00:29:30.874
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

00:29:32.695 --> 00:29:34.240
<i>Mark your position and return to base.</i>

00:29:34.323 --> 00:29:35.999
<i>Roger that, Ballroom.</i>

00:29:38.132 --> 00:29:39.300
<i>On your belly!</i>

00:29:39.383 --> 00:29:40.507
<i>It looks like a…</i>

00:29:40.602 --> 00:29:41.496
<i>man!</i>

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:44.238
<i>Shake him off!
Roll! Roll!</i>

00:29:51.959 --> 00:29:53.859
<i>I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

00:29:53.942 --> 00:29:56.285
- <i>It's confirmed.</i>
- <i>He has been hit.</i>

00:30:00.055 --> 00:30:01.692
<i>Punch out!
Punch out!</i>

00:30:08.272 --> 00:30:10.089
<i>Whiplash One down.</i>

00:30:10.172 --> 00:30:11.818
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

00:30:11.901 --> 00:30:14.286
<i>Negative!
No chute, no chute!</i>

00:30:19.658 --> 00:30:21.249
<i>My chute's jammed!</i>

00:30:27.082 --> 00:30:29.378
<i>Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.</i>

00:30:29.502 --> 00:30:30.651
Whiplash Two, reengage.

00:30:30.734 --> 00:30:32.411
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

00:30:34.647 --> 00:30:36.509
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

00:30:36.592 --> 00:30:38.631
- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22…

00:30:38.714 --> 00:30:39.954
inside a legal no fly zone!

00:30:40.037 --> 00:30:42.515
Whiplash Two, if you have
a clear shot, take it!

00:30:42.598 --> 00:30:44.826
<i>You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.</i>

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:46.366
Keep going!

00:30:54.068 --> 00:30:56.119
<i>Good chute!
Good chute!</i>

00:31:03.702 --> 00:31:05.413
Tony, you still there?

00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:06.581
<i>Hey, thanks.</i>

00:31:06.664 --> 00:31:09.109
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

00:31:10.042 --> 00:31:11.943
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

00:31:13.254 --> 00:31:15.606
Yeah, well technically he hit me, so…

00:31:15.798 --> 00:31:17.260
<i>Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?</i>

00:31:17.343 --> 00:31:20.264
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

00:31:20.388 --> 00:31:22.053
Now what am I supposed
to tell the press?

00:31:22.136 --> 00:31:24.599
<i>Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?</i>

00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:26.178
It's not that simple.

00:31:27.226 --> 00:31:29.061
An unfortunate training exercise…

00:31:29.144 --> 00:31:32.331
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

00:31:32.773 --> 00:31:35.964
I am pleased to report that
the pilot was not injured.

00:31:36.235 --> 00:31:40.024
<i>As for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in Gulmira…</i>

00:31:40.239 --> 00:31:43.785
<i>it is still unclear who
or what intervened…</i>

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:47.952
<i>but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.</i>

00:32:05.814 --> 00:32:06.815
Last chance, sir.

00:32:06.898 --> 00:32:09.292
<i>Wait. I want to see this.</i>

00:33:20.388 --> 00:33:21.549
Hey!

00:33:23.482 --> 00:33:25.336
<i>It is a tight fit, sir.</i>

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.204
<i>Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.</i>

00:33:29.322 --> 00:33:31.232
Be gentle.
This is my first time.

00:33:32.158 --> 00:33:33.918
I designed this to come off, so…

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.260
Hey.

00:33:36.245 --> 00:33:37.720
I really should be able to…

00:33:38.623 --> 00:33:40.283
<i>Please, try not to move, sir.</i>

00:33:41.542 --> 00:33:43.046
What's going on here?

00:33:48.382 --> 00:33:51.121
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

00:33:52.979 --> 00:33:54.779
Are those bullet holes?

00:34:22.296 --> 00:34:23.597
Welcome.

00:34:26.837 --> 00:34:29.136
Compliments of Tony Stark.

00:34:30.007 --> 00:34:33.271
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:35.805
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

00:34:35.888 --> 00:34:37.731
Show me the weapon.

00:34:38.797 --> 00:34:39.952
Come.

00:34:40.716 --> 00:34:42.706
Leave your guards outside.

00:34:59.161 --> 00:35:01.365
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

00:35:04.333 --> 00:35:06.350
So this is how he did it.

00:35:06.627 --> 00:35:08.487
This is only a first, crude effort.

00:35:09.338 --> 00:35:11.720
Stark has perfected his design.

00:35:12.091 --> 00:35:14.690
He has made a masterpiece of death.

00:35:15.144 --> 00:35:18.197
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

00:35:20.028 --> 00:35:22.075
And you dream of Stark's throne.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.850
We have a common enemy.

00:35:30.588 --> 00:35:32.428
If we are still in business…

00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:37.600
I will give you these designs…

00:35:38.951 --> 00:35:40.251
as a gift.

00:35:41.519 --> 00:35:42.963
And in turn…

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.931
I hope you'll repay me…

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:50.216
with a gift of iron soldiers.

00:36:06.687 --> 00:36:08.364
Technology.

00:36:09.941 --> 00:36:13.025
It's always been your Achilles'
heel in this part of the world.

00:36:14.654 --> 00:36:15.747
Don't worry.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.129
It'll only last for 15 minutes.

00:36:19.033 --> 00:36:21.309
That's the least of your problems.

00:36:26.791 --> 00:36:28.895
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:33.066
Alright, let's finish up here.

00:36:36.938 --> 00:36:39.971
Set up Sector 16 underneath
the arc reactor…

00:36:40.054 --> 00:36:42.079
and I'm going to want this data masked.

00:36:42.162 --> 00:36:43.558
Recruit our top engineers.

00:36:43.641 --> 00:36:45.541
I want a prototype right away.

00:36:50.294 --> 00:36:51.617
<i>Hello, Steve.</i>

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.177
Hi.

00:36:55.248 --> 00:36:57.334
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

00:36:57.609 --> 00:36:59.538
Officially, I am not here at all.

00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:01.871
That was quite a performance.

00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:03.487
Yeah.

00:37:04.554 --> 00:37:06.481
I had to improvise a little bit.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.020
The crowds I am used
to are usually more…

00:37:10.836 --> 00:37:11.487
twelve.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:13.706
I understand you're
America's New Hope.

00:37:13.789 --> 00:37:16.629
Bond sales take a 10% bump
in every state I visit.

00:37:16.712 --> 00:37:18.483
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?

00:37:19.838 --> 00:37:21.643
At least he's got me doing this.

00:37:21.887 --> 00:37:23.623
Phillips would have had me stuck in a lab.

00:37:23.706 --> 00:37:26.139
And these are your
only two options?

00:37:26.386 --> 00:37:28.783
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

00:37:29.584 --> 00:37:31.617
You were meant for more
than this, you know.

00:37:37.897 --> 00:37:39.065
What?

00:37:40.401 --> 00:37:42.585
You know, for the longest time,
I dreamed about…

00:37:43.853 --> 00:37:46.997
coming overseas and
being on the front lines…

00:37:47.658 --> 00:37:49.174
serving my country.

00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:51.891
I finally got everything I wanted…

00:37:55.372 --> 00:37:56.848
and I am wearing tights.

00:38:04.924 --> 00:38:06.891
They look like they have been
through hell.

00:38:07.227 --> 00:38:09.021
These men more than most.

00:38:12.378 --> 00:38:15.197
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.

00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:18.201
Two hundred men went up
against him…

00:38:18.322 --> 00:38:20.377
and less than 50 returned.

00:38:21.344 --> 00:38:24.246
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

00:38:24.553 --> 00:38:26.629
The rest were killed or captured.

00:38:26.712 --> 00:38:28.136
The 107th?

00:38:28.571 --> 00:38:29.760
What?

00:38:29.843 --> 00:38:31.088
Come on.

00:38:32.084 --> 00:38:32.859
Colonel Phillips.

00:38:32.942 --> 00:38:35.149
Well, if it isn't the Star Spangled
Man With A Plan.

00:38:35.232 --> 00:38:36.451
What's your plan today?

00:38:36.534 --> 00:38:37.908
I need the casualty list from Azzano.

00:38:37.991 --> 00:38:39.377
You don't get to give me orders, son.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.620
I just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

00:38:43.071 --> 00:38:45.661
You and I are going to have a
conversation later that you won't enjoy.

00:38:45.744 --> 00:38:48.602
Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R…
I can spell.

00:38:54.674 --> 00:38:59.206
I have signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.

00:38:59.745 --> 00:39:00.517
But…

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.338
the name does sound familiar.

00:39:02.421 --> 00:39:03.745
I am sorry.

00:39:07.517 --> 00:39:08.910
What about the others?

00:39:09.052 --> 00:39:10.322
Are you planning a rescue mission?

00:39:10.405 --> 00:39:12.116
Yes, it's called winning the war.

00:39:13.103 --> 00:39:14.399
But if you know where they are,
why not at least…

00:39:14.482 --> 00:39:16.485
They're 30 miles behind the lines…

00:39:16.568 --> 00:39:19.478
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

00:39:19.561 --> 00:39:21.032
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

00:39:21.115 --> 00:39:24.291
But I don't expect you to understand
that because you're a chorus girl.

00:39:25.979 --> 00:39:27.722
I think I understand just fine.

00:39:27.805 --> 00:39:29.659
Well, then understand it somewhere else.

00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:33.016
If I read the posters correctly,
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

00:39:38.818 --> 00:39:40.273
Yes, sir.

00:39:40.709 --> 00:39:41.969
I do.

00:39:45.737 --> 00:39:49.306
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

00:39:59.035 --> 00:40:02.319
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

00:40:02.406 --> 00:40:04.695
I need you to go to my office.

00:40:05.112 --> 00:40:06.789
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve…

00:40:06.872 --> 00:40:09.699
all the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

00:40:10.291 --> 00:40:11.671
This'll get you in.

00:40:11.999 --> 00:40:13.584
It's probably under Executive Files.

00:40:13.667 --> 00:40:14.251
If not…

00:40:14.334 --> 00:40:15.417
they put it on a ghost drive…

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.234
in which case you need to look
for the lowest numeric heading.

00:40:19.131 --> 00:40:21.558
And what do you plan to do with this
information if I bring it back here?

00:40:21.641 --> 00:40:22.657
Same drill.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.720
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

00:40:24.803 --> 00:40:26.355
I'm going to find my weapons…

00:40:26.604 --> 00:40:28.260
and destroy them.

00:40:28.805 --> 00:40:30.024
Tony…

00:40:32.281 --> 00:40:34.208
you know that I would
help you with anything…

00:40:34.291 --> 00:40:35.304
but…

00:40:35.387 --> 00:40:38.254
I cannot help you if you're going
to start all of this again.

00:40:38.337 --> 00:40:40.613
There is nothing except this.

00:40:40.769 --> 00:40:42.125
There's no art opening.

00:40:42.208 --> 00:40:44.409
There is no benefit.
There is nothing…

00:40:44.492 --> 00:40:45.910
to sign.

00:40:46.445 --> 00:40:48.269
There is the next mission…

00:40:48.697 --> 00:40:50.176
and nothing else.

00:40:50.871 --> 00:40:52.171
Is that so?

00:40:54.374 --> 00:40:55.814
Well, then I quit.

00:40:58.892 --> 00:41:00.589
You stood by my side all these years…

00:41:00.672 --> 00:41:03.320
while I reaped the benefits of destruction.

00:41:03.738 --> 00:41:05.597
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people…

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.555
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

00:41:07.638 --> 00:41:09.653
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.

00:41:10.224 --> 00:41:12.022
I'm not going to be a part of it.

00:41:12.105 --> 00:41:13.601
I shouldn't be alive…

00:41:15.416 --> 00:41:17.301
unless it was for a reason.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.212
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:22.151
I just finally know…

00:41:22.837 --> 00:41:24.516
what I have to do.

00:41:28.283 --> 00:41:29.959
And I know in my heart…

00:41:30.099 --> 00:41:31.525
that it's right.

00:41:46.802 --> 00:41:48.617
You're all I have, too, you know.

00:41:54.752 --> 00:41:56.868
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

00:41:56.951 --> 00:41:57.995
If that's what it takes.

00:41:58.078 --> 00:42:00.485
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.

00:42:00.568 --> 00:42:01.310
You don't know that.

00:42:01.393 --> 00:42:03.523
Even so, he's devising a strategy.
If he detects--

00:42:03.606 --> 00:42:06.187
By the time he's done that,
it could be too late.

00:42:06.751 --> 00:42:07.856
Steve.

00:42:14.067 --> 00:42:16.296
You told me you thought I was
meant for more than this.

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:18.480
Did you mean that?

00:42:19.601 --> 00:42:21.058
Every word.

00:42:22.637 --> 00:42:24.226
Then you got to let me go.

00:42:27.297 --> 00:42:29.055
I can do more than that.

00:42:29.444 --> 00:42:30.970
On stage, girls.

00:42:31.053 --> 00:42:32.738
Five minutes.

00:42:33.915 --> 00:42:35.406
Where's my helmet?

00:42:35.489 --> 00:42:37.163
Anyone seen Rogers?

00:42:40.921 --> 00:42:42.977
The Hydra camp is in Krausberg…

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.800
tucked between these
two mountain ranges.

00:42:44.883 --> 00:42:46.087
It's a factory of some kind.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:48.431
We should be able to drop
you right on the doorstep.

00:42:48.514 --> 00:42:50.170
Just get me as close as you can.

00:42:50.253 --> 00:42:52.044
You two are going to be
in a lot of trouble when you land.

00:42:52.127 --> 00:42:53.172
And you won't?

00:42:53.255 --> 00:42:55.712
Where I am going, if anybody yells
at me, I can just shoot them.

00:42:55.795 --> 00:42:57.429
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.505
Well, let's hope it's good for something.

00:42:59.636 --> 00:43:00.617
Agent Carter?

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.994
If we're not in too much of a hurry…

00:43:02.077 --> 00:43:05.459
I thought we could stop off
in Lucerne for a late-night fondue.

00:43:10.807 --> 00:43:13.732
Stark is the best civilian pilot
I have ever seen.

00:43:13.815 --> 00:43:16.737
He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.

00:43:18.138 --> 00:43:20.201
So, are you two...
Do you…

00:43:22.163 --> 00:43:23.517
fondue?

00:43:24.752 --> 00:43:26.823
This is your transponder.
Activate it when you're ready…

00:43:26.906 --> 00:43:29.320
and the signal will lead us
straight to you.

00:43:30.473 --> 00:43:32.125
Are you sure this thing works?

00:43:32.578 --> 00:43:34.518
It's been tested more than you, pal.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.406
Get back here.
We're taking you all the way in.

00:43:44.019 --> 00:43:47.353
As soon as I am clear, you turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here.

00:43:47.436 --> 00:43:49.441
You can't give me orders.

00:43:49.524 --> 00:43:50.955
The hell I can't.

00:43:51.062 --> 00:43:52.344
I am a Captain.

00:45:13.835 --> 00:45:15.409
<i>Sector 16?</i>

00:45:16.688 --> 00:45:18.952
What are you up to, Obadiah?

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.816
<i>You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.</i>

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:37.443
- <i>As you can see, Obadiah Stane…</i>
- Oh, my God.

00:45:37.526 --> 00:45:40.430
<i>Your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.</i>

00:45:40.513 --> 00:45:43.524
<i>The price to kill Tony
Stark has just gone up.</i>

00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:48.177
So…

00:45:49.889 --> 00:45:51.730
what are we going to do about this?

00:46:03.468 --> 00:46:04.653
I know…

00:46:04.736 --> 00:46:07.133
what you're going through, Pepper.

00:46:14.713 --> 00:46:15.816
Tony.

00:46:15.899 --> 00:46:18.559
He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

00:46:39.755 --> 00:46:41.773
I was so happy…

00:46:43.057 --> 00:46:44.312
when he came home.

00:46:44.395 --> 00:46:47.397
It was like we got him
back from the dead.

00:46:50.194 --> 00:46:52.052
Now I realize…

00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:55.068
well…

00:46:55.151 --> 00:46:57.774
Tony never really did come home, did he?

00:46:59.441 --> 00:47:02.261
He left a part of himself in that cave.

00:47:04.863 --> 00:47:06.628
Breaks my heart.

00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:09.925
Well…

00:47:10.933 --> 00:47:13.080
he's a complicated person.

00:47:15.457 --> 00:47:19.068
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be alright.

00:47:25.133 --> 00:47:28.208
You are a very rare woman.

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:32.774
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:37.357
Thank you. Thanks.

00:47:39.314 --> 00:47:41.408
I'd better get back there.

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:48.832
Is that today's paper?

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:51.729
Yes.

00:47:52.077 --> 00:47:53.612
Do you mind?

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:55.341
Not at all.

00:47:55.424 --> 00:47:56.206
Puzzle.

00:47:56.289 --> 00:47:57.604
Of course.

00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:02.386
Take care.

00:48:26.528 --> 00:48:27.288
Ms. Potts?

00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:28.334
We had an appointment.

00:48:28.417 --> 00:48:29.448
Did you forget about our appointment?

00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:31.033
Nope, right now. Come with me.

00:48:31.116 --> 00:48:31.943
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

00:48:32.026 --> 00:48:33.176
Yep, walk with me.

00:48:33.658 --> 00:48:34.658
Ok.

00:48:35.287 --> 00:48:36.667
I'm going to give you
the meeting of your life.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.037
Your office.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.120
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.567
Absolutely, we're…

00:48:44.168 --> 00:48:45.588
I'm going to have to call you back.

00:48:46.006 --> 00:48:46.964
Mr. Stane?

00:48:47.047 --> 00:48:47.998
Sir…

00:48:48.081 --> 00:48:49.331
we've explored what
you've asked us…

00:48:49.414 --> 00:48:51.011
and it seems as though
there is a little hiccup.

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.781
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

00:48:52.864 --> 00:48:54.457
Yes, to power the suit…

00:48:54.881 --> 00:48:56.809
sir, the technology actually doesn't exist.

00:48:56.892 --> 00:48:58.165
- So it's... it's...
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:48:58.248 --> 00:48:59.614
The technology?

00:49:00.145 --> 00:49:03.050
William, here is the technology.

00:49:03.899 --> 00:49:06.151
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

00:49:06.234 --> 00:49:08.145
Ok sir, that's what we're trying to do but…

00:49:08.228 --> 00:49:10.197
honestly, it's impossible.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.878
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

00:49:14.939 --> 00:49:17.056
With a box of scraps!

00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:20.415
Well, I'm sorry.

00:49:20.781 --> 00:49:22.619
I'm not Tony Stark.

00:49:38.266 --> 00:49:39.566
<i>Tony?</i>

00:49:42.062 --> 00:49:43.430
<i>Tony, are you there?</i>

00:49:44.663 --> 00:49:45.787
<i>Hello?</i>

00:49:46.845 --> 00:49:48.188
Breathe.

00:49:49.277 --> 00:49:52.042
Easy, easy.

00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:56.530
You remember this one, right?

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.242
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

00:50:00.325 --> 00:50:04.798
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

00:50:06.877 --> 00:50:08.286
Tony.

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:11.949
When I…

00:50:12.987 --> 00:50:15.184
ordered the hit on you…

00:50:17.514 --> 00:50:20.023
I worried that I was…

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:25.321
killing the golden goose.

00:50:26.398 --> 00:50:28.272
But you see…

00:50:28.786 --> 00:50:30.417
it was just…

00:50:31.486 --> 00:50:33.830
fate that you survived that.

00:50:38.827 --> 00:50:42.947
You had one last golden egg to give.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.668
Do you really think that just
because you have an idea…

00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:52.491
it belongs to you?

00:50:56.073 --> 00:50:57.595
Your father…

00:50:58.364 --> 00:51:01.266
he helped give us the atomic bomb.

00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:05.597
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

00:51:15.634 --> 00:51:17.386
Oh, it's beautiful.

00:51:19.868 --> 00:51:21.427
Oh, Tony…

00:51:22.753 --> 00:51:25.126
this is your Ninth Symphony.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:29.669
What a masterpiece.
Look at that.

00:51:30.796 --> 00:51:32.680
This is your legacy.

00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:37.717
A new generation of weapons…

00:51:38.403 --> 00:51:40.489
with this at its heart.

00:51:43.558 --> 00:51:47.180
Weapons that will help steer
the world back on course…

00:51:47.263 --> 00:51:49.558
put the balance of power in our hands.

00:51:51.233 --> 00:51:52.871
The right hands.

00:51:55.987 --> 00:51:58.002
I wish you could've seen…

00:51:59.108 --> 00:52:00.867
my prototype.

00:52:01.855 --> 00:52:03.327
It's not as...

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:07.897
Well, not as conservative as yours.

00:52:09.751 --> 00:52:12.541
Too bad you had
to involve Pepper in this.

00:52:13.006 --> 00:52:15.238
I would have preferred that she lived.
