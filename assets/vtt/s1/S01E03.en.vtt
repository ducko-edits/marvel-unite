00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.600
<i>Once,</i>

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.440
<i>mankind accepted a simple truth,</i>

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.160
<i>that they were not
alone in this universe.</i>

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:26.546
<i>Some worlds man believed
to be home to their gods.</i>

00:00:26.906 --> 00:00:29.666
<i>Others, they knew to fear.</i>

00:00:33.106 --> 00:00:37.746
<i>From a realm of cold and
darkness came the Frost Giants,</i>

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:55.386
<i>threatening to plunge the
mortal world into a new ice age.</i>

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:06.026
<i>But humanity would
not face this threat alone.</i>

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:44.786
<i>Our armies drove
the Frost Giants</i>

00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:46.986
<i>back into the heart
of their own world.</i>

00:01:50.386 --> 00:01:52.546
<i>The cost was great.</i>

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:55.026
<i>In the end,</i>

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:57.306
<i>their king fell.</i>

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:04.986
<i>And the source of their
power was taken from them.</i>

00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:08.146
<i>With the last great war ended,</i>

00:02:08.186 --> 00:02:12.546
<i>we withdrew from the other
worlds and returned home</i>

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.826
<i>to the Realm Eternal,</i>

00:02:16.146 --> 00:02:17.826
<i>Asgard.</i>

00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:52.066
<i>Here we remain as
a beacon of hope,</i>

00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:56.026
<i>shining out across the stars.</i>

00:02:57.066 --> 00:03:00.426
<i>And though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends,</i>

00:03:01.746 --> 00:03:03.946
<i>it was Asgard</i>

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:06.106
<i>and its warriors</i>

00:03:06.146 --> 00:03:07.586
<i>that brought peace</i>

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:09.626
to the universe.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.106
But the day will come

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:18.946
when one of you

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.906
will have to defend that peace.

00:03:22.586 --> 00:03:24.786
Do the Frost Giants still live?

00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:26.106
When I'm king,

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:30.106
I'll hunt the monsters
down and slay them all!

00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:32.786
Just as you did, Father.

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:34.946
A wise king

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:39.106
never seeks out war.

00:03:44.306 --> 00:03:46.506
But he must always
be ready for it.

00:03:58.306 --> 00:03:59.546
I'm ready, Father.

00:03:59.626 --> 00:04:00.826
So am I.

00:04:02.146 --> 00:04:04.786
Only one of you can
ascend to the throne.

00:04:04.826 --> 00:04:08.826
But both of you
were born to be kings.

00:05:08.148 --> 00:05:09.748
That's no satellite crash!

00:05:09.868 --> 00:05:11.068
They would have hauled
the wreckage away,

00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:12.748
they wouldn't have
built a city around it.

00:05:14.188 --> 00:05:15.708
You're going to need this.

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.708
What? Wait, why?

00:05:21.028 --> 00:05:22.388
Now stay here.

00:05:22.748 --> 00:05:24.188
Once I have Mjolnir,

00:05:24.228 --> 00:05:26.268
I will return the items
they've stolen from you.

00:05:26.588 --> 00:05:27.588
Deal?

00:05:27.988 --> 00:05:30.268
No. Look what's down there.

00:05:30.388 --> 00:05:32.068
You think you're
just gonna walk in,

00:05:32.108 --> 00:05:33.228
grab our stuff and walk out?

00:05:33.348 --> 00:05:35.388
No. I'm going to fly out.

00:05:43.268 --> 00:05:44.668
Sir, feed from the keyhole

00:05:44.748 --> 00:05:46.068
can barely penetrate
the cloud cover.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.708
Tech's barely working as it is,

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:49.948
with all the interference
that thing's giving off.

00:05:50.388 --> 00:05:52.788
And we've got a commercial
aircraft coming right over us.

00:05:52.908 --> 00:05:55.948
Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.

00:05:56.068 --> 00:05:57.268
Reroute it like all the others.

00:05:58.508 --> 00:05:59.548
Hold a sec.

00:05:59.628 --> 00:06:02.468
We've got something
outside the fence, west side.

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:06.068
<i>Delancey, Jackson.
West side perimeter. Go check it out.</i>

00:06:08.548 --> 00:06:09.868
There it is.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.268
Delancey, Jackson. Report.

00:06:28.628 --> 00:06:30.468
Agent down.
We've got a perimeter breach.

00:06:43.468 --> 00:06:47.628
<i>You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
Please leave me a message.</i>

00:06:48.468 --> 00:06:51.628
Hi, Erik, it's me.
Don't worry, I'm fine,

00:06:51.988 --> 00:06:54.308
but just in case you don't
hear from me in the next hour,

00:06:54.428 --> 00:06:57.308
just come by the crater site
and try and find me, okay?

00:06:57.348 --> 00:07:00.188
I did exactly what you
told me not to. I'm sorry.

00:07:00.468 --> 00:07:01.988
So sorry. Bye.

00:07:05.828 --> 00:07:07.108
Bravo quadrant, move!

00:07:20.628 --> 00:07:21.708
Entering south tunnel!

00:07:23.828 --> 00:07:25.788
<i>Negative, negative.
I have no comms.</i>

00:07:39.468 --> 00:07:41.428
Target sighted, east tunnel!

00:07:41.508 --> 00:07:43.228
I need eyes up high, with a gun.

00:08:09.028 --> 00:08:10.228
Moving north!

00:08:18.228 --> 00:08:19.228
What have we got?

00:08:19.268 --> 00:08:20.748
There's a massive
electromagnetic surge

00:08:20.908 --> 00:08:22.028
coming off that thing.

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:23.908
Systems are barely coping.

00:08:24.068 --> 00:08:25.788
Barton? Talk to me.

00:08:27.188 --> 00:08:28.788
You want me to
slow him down, sir?

00:08:30.028 --> 00:08:32.228
Or are you sending in
more guys for him to beat up?

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:33.948
I'll let you know.

00:08:48.788 --> 00:08:50.148
You're big.

00:08:51.268 --> 00:08:52.588
Fought bigger.

00:09:37.148 --> 00:09:40.988
Better call it, Coulson, 'cause
I'm starting to root for this guy.

00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:02.668
Last chance, sir.

00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:04.828
<i>Wait. I want to see this.</i>

00:10:50.957 --> 00:10:53.957
All right, show's over.
Ground units, move in.

00:11:24.131 --> 00:11:25.571
Oh, please.

00:12:22.303 --> 00:12:25.823
Thor Odinson,

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:28.848
my heir,

00:12:31.808 --> 00:12:33.808
my firstborn.

00:12:34.648 --> 00:12:40.128
So long entrusted with
the mighty hammer Mjolnir,

00:12:40.168 --> 00:12:43.288
forged in the heart
of a dying star,

00:12:43.808 --> 00:12:46.608
its power has no equal,

00:12:46.648 --> 00:12:49.368
as a weapon to destroy

00:12:49.488 --> 00:12:51.648
or as a tool to build.

00:12:52.328 --> 00:12:55.008
'Tis a fit companion for a king.

00:12:56.488 --> 00:12:59.048
I have defended Asgard

00:12:59.168 --> 00:13:03.208
and the lives of the innocent
across the Nine Realms

00:13:03.328 --> 00:13:05.688
<i>from the time of
the great beginning.</i>

00:13:06.528 --> 00:13:08.008
<i>Though the day has come...</i>

00:13:34.488 --> 00:13:37.368
Do you swear to
guard the Nine Realms?

00:13:38.008 --> 00:13:39.008
I swear.

00:13:39.088 --> 00:13:42.608
And do you swear to
preserve the peace?

00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:44.008
I swear.

00:13:44.088 --> 00:13:45.928
Do you swear

00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:49.648
to cast aside all
selfish ambition

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:52.568
and to pledge yourself only
to the good of the Realms?

00:13:52.608 --> 00:13:53.768
I swear!

00:13:54.048 --> 00:13:56.448
Then, on this day,

00:13:56.568 --> 00:13:59.208
I, Odin Allfather,

00:14:00.728 --> 00:14:02.248
proclaim you...

00:14:16.048 --> 00:14:17.208
The Frost Giants!

00:15:02.408 --> 00:15:04.408
The Jotuns must pay
for what they've done!

00:15:04.448 --> 00:15:06.808
They have paid,
with their lives.

00:15:07.968 --> 00:15:09.968
The Destroyer did its work,

00:15:10.288 --> 00:15:12.288
the Casket is
safe, and all is well.

00:15:12.648 --> 00:15:13.648
All is well?

00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:17.168
They broke into
the weapons vault!

00:15:17.328 --> 00:15:19.848
If the Frost Giants had stolen
even one of these relics...

00:15:19.968 --> 00:15:21.088
They didn't.

00:15:21.168 --> 00:15:22.368
Well, I want to know why!

00:15:25.088 --> 00:15:27.408
I have a truce with
Laufey, King of the Jotuns.

00:15:27.488 --> 00:15:31.888
He just broke your truce!
They know you are vulnerable!

00:15:32.368 --> 00:15:33.968
What action would you take?

00:15:34.008 --> 00:15:37.368
March into Jotunheim as you once did.
Teach them a lesson.

00:15:37.808 --> 00:15:38.888
Break their spirits

00:15:39.008 --> 00:15:41.128
so they'll never dare try
to cross our borders again.

00:15:41.168 --> 00:15:42.488
You're thinking
only as a warrior.

00:15:42.528 --> 00:15:43.848
This was an act of war!

00:15:43.888 --> 00:15:46.168
It was the act of but
a few, doomed to fail.

00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:47.728
Look how far they got!

00:15:47.848 --> 00:15:50.248
We will find the breach in our
defenses and it will be sealed.

00:15:50.328 --> 00:15:51.688
As King of Asgard...

00:15:51.728 --> 00:15:54.528
But you're not king!

00:15:57.408 --> 00:15:58.728
Not yet.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.340
Notes. Main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.300
Hull pressurization
is problematic.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.860
I'm thinking icing is
the probable factor.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.180
<i>A very astute observation, sir.</i>

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.020
<i>Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,</i>

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.580
<i>we should improve
the exosystems.</i>

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.220
Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.420
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.300
That should ensure
a fuselage integrity

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.380
while maintaining
power-to-weight ratio.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.700
- Got it?
<i>- Yes.</i>

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.140
<i>Shall I render using
proposed specifications?</i>

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.540
Thrill me.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.100
<i>Tonight's red-hot red carpet</i>

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.500
<i>is right here at the
Disney Concert Hall,</i>

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.900
<i>where Tony Stark's
third annual benefit</i>

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.860
<i>for the Firefighter's
Family Fund</i>

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.500
<i>has become the place to
be for L.A.'s high society.</i>

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.860
Jarvis, we get
an invite for that?

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.420
<i>I have no record
of an invitation, sir.</i>

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.980
<i>...hasn't been seen in public</i>

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.780
<i>since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.</i>

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.660
<i>Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress</i>

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.340
<i>and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,</i>

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.580
<i>no one expects an
appearance from him tonight.</i>

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.820
<i>The render is complete.</i>

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.580
A little ostentatious,
don't you think?

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.740
<i>What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.</i>

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.980
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.940
<i>Yes, that should help
you keep a low profile.</i>

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.060
<i>The render is complete.</i>

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.420
Hey, I like it.
Fabricate it. Paint it.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.100
<i>Commencing automated assembly.</i>

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.340
<i>Estimated completion
time is five hours.</i>

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.620
Don't wait up for me, honey.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.500
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.340
is all about, and
our partnership

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.260
with the fire and
rescue community...

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.660
Hey, Tony, remember me?

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.980
Sure don't.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.500
You look great, Hef.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.700
We're going to
have a great quarter.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.500
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.820
Look at you.
Hey, what a surprise.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.660
I'll see you inside.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.500
Hey. Listen, take it
slow, all right?

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.340
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.980
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.380
Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.500
Mr. Stark?

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.500
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.620
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.340
God, you need a
new name for that.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.380
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:40.020
Listen, I know this must be a trying
time for you, but we need to debrief you.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.060
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions,

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.020
and time can be a
factor with these things.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.140
Let's just put
something on the books.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.580
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at Stark Industries?

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.180
Tell you what. You got it.
You're absolutely right.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.660
Well, I'm going to go to my
assistant, and we'll make a date.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.220
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.540
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.420
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.340
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.540
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.900
Yes.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.900
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.460
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.100
Am I making you uncomfortable?

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.780
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.700
in front of everyone that I work
with in a dress with no back.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.100
You look great
and you smell great.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.540
Oh, God.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.500
But I could fire you if that
would take the edge off.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.260
I actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.740
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.340
What's your Social
Security number?

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.580
- Five.
- Five?

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.740
- Right.
- Right.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.140
You're missing just a
couple of digits there.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.420
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.220
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.940
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.820
It was totally not
harmless, by the way.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.340
We're dancing.
No one's even watching.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.220
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.460
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.940
No, it was not just a dance.
You don't understand because you're you.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.820
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.140
and how you are with girls and
all of that, which is completely fine.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.620
But, you know, then
me, you're my boss,

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.660
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.620
Because it makes me look
like the one who's trying to...

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.620
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.500
and then I'm
wearing this ridiculous

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.340
dress, and then we were
dancing like that and...

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.180
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.460
- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:24.220
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.180
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.380
Make one of them
dirty, will you?

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.660
Wow. Tony Stark.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.340
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.380
- Carrie.
- Christine.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.460
That's right.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.220
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.700
Can I at least get a
reaction from you?

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.220
Panic. I would say
panic is my reaction.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.660
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.100
involvement in
this latest atrocity.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.420
Yeah. They just put
my name on the invitation.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.700
I don't know what to tell you.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.180
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.660
I was out of town for a couple
months, in case you didn't hear.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.060
Is this what you
call accountability?

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.860
It's a town called Gulmira.
Heard of it?

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.580
When were these taken?

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.820
Yesterday.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.340
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.380
Well, I'm not my company.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.700
Please, do you mind?

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.740
Have you seen
these pictures? Huh?

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.180
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.740
You can't afford
to be this naive.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.580
You know what?
I was naive before,

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.300
when they said, "Here's the line.
We don't cross it.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.980
"This is how we do business."

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.260
If we're double-dealing
under the table... Are we?

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.820
Tony, your picture, please!

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.580
Let's take a picture.
Come on. Picture time!

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.460
Tony. Who do you
think locked you out?

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.460
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.620
It was the only way
I could protect you.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.300
No. No.

00:24:42.947 --> 00:24:45.947
It's unwise to be in my
company right now, Brother.

00:24:46.987 --> 00:24:49.827
This was to be
my day of triumph.

00:24:52.027 --> 00:24:53.347
It'll come.

00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:55.987
In time.

00:24:56.027 --> 00:24:58.307
What's this?

00:24:59.787 --> 00:25:02.867
If it's any consolation,
I think you're right.

00:25:02.987 --> 00:25:05.827
About the Frost Giants,
about Laufey, about everything.

00:25:06.707 --> 00:25:09.787
If they found a way to penetrate
Asgard's defenses once,

00:25:09.827 --> 00:25:11.387
who's to say they
won't try again?

00:25:11.507 --> 00:25:12.507
Next time with an army.

00:25:12.547 --> 00:25:13.547
Exactly.

00:25:13.667 --> 00:25:16.387
There's nothing you can
do without defying Father.

00:25:18.547 --> 00:25:20.387
No, no, no. I know that look.

00:25:20.547 --> 00:25:22.667
That's the only way to ensure
the safety of our borders.

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.267
Thor, it's madness.

00:25:24.347 --> 00:25:26.787
Madness? What sort of madness?

00:25:27.227 --> 00:25:29.067
We're going to Jotunheim.

00:25:30.507 --> 00:25:31.667
What?

00:25:32.227 --> 00:25:34.027
This isn't like a
journey to Earth

00:25:34.067 --> 00:25:36.147
where you summon a
little lightning and thunder,

00:25:36.187 --> 00:25:38.867
and the mortals
worship you as a god.

00:25:38.987 --> 00:25:40.227
This is Jotunheim.

00:25:40.347 --> 00:25:42.667
My father fought his
way into Jotunheim,

00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:45.507
defeated their armies
and took their Casket.

00:25:45.707 --> 00:25:47.187
We would just be
looking for answers.

00:25:47.347 --> 00:25:48.587
It is forbidden!

00:25:50.867 --> 00:25:53.907
My friends, have you forgotten
all that we have done together?

00:25:54.267 --> 00:25:56.027
Fandral, Hogun.

00:25:56.187 --> 00:25:59.027
Who led you into the
most glorious of battles?

00:25:59.667 --> 00:26:01.027
You did.

00:26:01.267 --> 00:26:03.387
And Volstagg, to
delicacies so succulent,

00:26:03.507 --> 00:26:06.067
you thought you'd died
and gone to Valhalla?

00:26:07.507 --> 00:26:08.507
You did.

00:26:08.547 --> 00:26:09.587
Yes!

00:26:09.707 --> 00:26:11.667
And who proved wrong
all who scoffed at the idea

00:26:11.747 --> 00:26:14.227
that a young maiden could
be one of the fiercest warriors

00:26:14.267 --> 00:26:15.267
this realm has ever known?

00:26:15.387 --> 00:26:16.387
I did.

00:26:16.747 --> 00:26:19.387
True, but I supported you, Sif.

00:26:19.507 --> 00:26:20.867
My friends,

00:26:21.227 --> 00:26:23.227
we're going to Jotunheim.

00:27:14.467 --> 00:27:15.667
You leave this to me.

00:27:17.347 --> 00:27:18.427
Good Heimdall...

00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:19.947
You're not dressed
warmly enough.

00:27:20.067 --> 00:27:21.187
I'm sorry?

00:27:21.307 --> 00:27:24.107
Do you think that
you can deceive me?

00:27:24.747 --> 00:27:26.707
- You must be mistaken...
- Enough!

00:27:30.187 --> 00:27:31.747
Heimdall, may we pass?

00:27:32.107 --> 00:27:38.307
Never has an enemy
slipped my watch until this day.

00:27:39.827 --> 00:27:41.827
I wish to know
how that happened.

00:27:41.947 --> 00:27:44.547
Then tell no one where we
have gone until we've returned.

00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:46.467
Understand?

00:27:50.827 --> 00:27:53.107
What happened?
Silver tongue turn to lead?

00:28:37.867 --> 00:28:39.187
Be warned.

00:28:39.427 --> 00:28:43.867
I will honor my sworn oath to
protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.

00:28:44.267 --> 00:28:47.347
If your return threatens
the safety of Asgard,

00:28:47.387 --> 00:28:49.747
Bifrost will remain
closed to you

00:28:50.067 --> 00:28:53.347
and you'll be left to die in
the cold waste of Jotunheim.

00:28:53.387 --> 00:28:55.387
Couldn't you just leave
the bridge open for us?

00:28:55.427 --> 00:28:56.707
To leave the bridge open

00:28:56.867 --> 00:28:59.027
would unleash the
full power of the Bifrost

00:28:59.067 --> 00:29:02.267
and destroy Jotunheim
with you upon it.

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:04.427
I have no plans to die today.

00:29:04.547 --> 00:29:06.227
None do.

00:29:52.267 --> 00:29:53.787
We shouldn't be here.

00:29:55.987 --> 00:29:57.627
Let's move.

00:30:13.243 --> 00:30:17.523
<i>The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described</i>

00:30:17.563 --> 00:30:21.283
<i>as a descent into hell, into a
modern day</i> Heart of Darkness.

00:30:21.443 --> 00:30:24.403
<i>Simple farmers and
herders from peaceful villages</i>

00:30:24.443 --> 00:30:26.203
<i>have been driven
from their homes,</i>

00:30:26.243 --> 00:30:28.363
<i>displaced from their
lands by warlords</i>

00:30:28.403 --> 00:30:30.523
<i>emboldened by a new-found power.</i>

00:30:30.843 --> 00:30:33.883
<i>Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings</i>

00:30:33.923 --> 00:30:36.763
<i>they can find in the
ruins of other villages,</i>

00:30:36.803 --> 00:30:40.683
<i>or here in the remnants of
an old Soviet smelting plant.</i>

00:30:45.443 --> 00:30:48.843
<i>Recent violence has been
attributed to a group of foreign fighters</i>

00:30:48.963 --> 00:30:51.643
<i>referred to by locals
as the Ten Rings.</i>

00:30:51.923 --> 00:30:55.283
<i>As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.</i>

00:30:55.323 --> 00:30:59.443
<i>A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.</i>

00:30:59.683 --> 00:31:02.243
<i>With no political will or
international pressure,</i>

00:31:02.283 --> 00:31:04.803
<i>there's very little hope
for these refugees.</i>

00:31:04.843 --> 00:31:08.123
<i>Around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband,</i>

00:31:08.203 --> 00:31:10.003
<i>who was kidnapped by insurgents,</i>

00:31:10.083 --> 00:31:12.643
<i>either forced to
join their militia...</i>

00:31:13.643 --> 00:31:16.323
<i>Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,</i>

00:31:16.363 --> 00:31:18.963
<i>holding them up to
anyone who will stop.</i>

00:31:19.003 --> 00:31:22.643
<i>A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"</i>

00:31:24.283 --> 00:31:26.683
<i>There's very little
hope for these refugees,</i>

00:31:26.763 --> 00:31:30.643
<i>refugees who can only
wonder who, if anyone, will help.</i>

00:35:01.871 --> 00:35:03.591
He's all yours.

00:36:02.751 --> 00:36:04.351
- What the hell was that?
- Were we cleared to go in there?

00:36:04.792 --> 00:36:06.841
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

00:36:06.921 --> 00:36:08.816
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

00:36:08.886 --> 00:36:10.167
Get those monitors up!

00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:11.801
We got a bogey!

00:36:11.841 --> 00:36:14.001
- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

00:36:14.081 --> 00:36:16.041
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

00:36:16.121 --> 00:36:17.801
No, it definitely
is not us, sir!

00:36:17.841 --> 00:36:19.561
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

00:36:19.641 --> 00:36:22.121
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:24.481
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

00:36:24.561 --> 00:36:27.201
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

00:36:34.041 --> 00:36:35.761
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:37.561
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

00:36:37.641 --> 00:36:39.881
Any high altitude
surveillance in the region?

00:36:39.961 --> 00:36:41.641
We got an AWAC and a
Global Hawk in the area.

00:36:41.721 --> 00:36:43.401
So this thing just
appeared out of nowhere?

00:36:43.481 --> 00:36:44.881
How come it didn't
show up on the radar?

00:36:44.921 --> 00:36:46.921
Got a minimal radar
cross-section, sir.

00:36:47.001 --> 00:36:49.161
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

00:36:49.281 --> 00:36:51.641
We think it's an
unmanned aerial vehicle.

00:36:51.721 --> 00:36:53.561
Colonel, what are
we dealing with here?

00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:59.041
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

00:37:02.561 --> 00:37:04.401
- Hello?
- Tony?

00:37:04.481 --> 00:37:06.241
<i>- Who's this?</i>
- It's Rhodes.

00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:08.561
- Sorry, hello?
<i>- I said it's Rhodes.</i>

00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:11.521
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

00:37:11.561 --> 00:37:13.241
Oh, yeah, I'm driving
with the top down.

00:37:13.401 --> 00:37:15.081
Yeah, well, I need
your help right now.

00:37:15.121 --> 00:37:16.521
<i>It's funny how that works, huh?</i>

00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:20.001
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:21.721
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

00:37:21.801 --> 00:37:23.441
<i>Well, that's a hot spot.</i>

00:37:23.521 --> 00:37:26.041
<i>Sounds like someone stepped
in and did your job for you, huh?</i>

00:37:26.081 --> 00:37:27.201
Why do you sound
out of breath, Tony?

00:37:27.241 --> 00:37:28.481
<i>I'm not, I was just
jogging in the canyon.</i>

00:37:28.601 --> 00:37:30.361
- I thought you were driving.
<i>- Right, I was driving</i>

00:37:30.401 --> 00:37:32.241
<i>to the canyon,
where I'm going to jog.</i>

00:37:32.281 --> 00:37:34.681
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

00:37:34.761 --> 00:37:36.241
<i>- Nope!</i>
- Bogey spotted!

00:37:36.281 --> 00:37:37.601
Whiplash, come in hot.

00:37:37.641 --> 00:37:39.081
Okay, good, 'cause
I'm staring at one

00:37:39.121 --> 00:37:42.561
right now, and it's about to
be blown to kingdom come.

00:37:43.121 --> 00:37:44.881
That's my exit.

00:37:49.721 --> 00:37:52.761
<i>Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.</i>

00:37:53.361 --> 00:37:54.801
Whiplash One, what is it?

00:37:54.921 --> 00:37:56.241
<i>I've got no idea.</i>

00:37:56.281 --> 00:37:57.321
You have radio contact?

00:37:57.401 --> 00:37:58.641
<i>Non responsive, sir.</i>

00:37:58.721 --> 00:37:59.801
Then you are clear to engage.

00:38:01.801 --> 00:38:02.841
<i>Hit it.</i>

00:38:07.641 --> 00:38:10.681
<i>That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!</i>

00:38:14.681 --> 00:38:16.681
<i>- Inbound missile.</i>
- Flares!

00:38:19.721 --> 00:38:22.281
<i>Wait a second.
Bogey deployed flares!</i>

00:38:36.601 --> 00:38:37.801
Deploy flaps!

00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:40.281
Holy!

00:38:40.321 --> 00:38:41.921
That thing just jumped
off the radar, sir.

00:38:42.001 --> 00:38:43.561
The sat visual has been lost.

00:38:43.641 --> 00:38:45.321
<i>No way that's a UAV.</i>

00:38:45.401 --> 00:38:46.561
What is it?

00:38:46.681 --> 00:38:48.201
I can't see anything.

00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:50.761
<i>Whatever it was, it
just bought the farm.</i>

00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:53.841
<i>I think bogey's
been handled, sir.</i>

00:39:03.201 --> 00:39:04.921
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.</i>

00:39:05.001 --> 00:39:06.681
- It's who?
<i>- I'm sorry, it is me.</i>

00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.041
<i>You asked. What you were
asking about is me.</i>

00:39:08.121 --> 00:39:09.641
No, see, this isn't a game.

00:39:09.681 --> 00:39:13.001
You do not send civilian
equipment into my active war zone.

00:39:13.081 --> 00:39:15.001
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

00:39:15.121 --> 00:39:17.881
I'm in it. It's a suit.
It's me!

00:39:18.041 --> 00:39:20.401
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

00:39:21.561 --> 00:39:23.201
<i>Mark your position
and return to base.</i>

00:39:23.281 --> 00:39:24.921
<i>Roger that, Ballroom.</i>

00:39:27.201 --> 00:39:28.361
<i>On your belly!</i>

00:39:28.401 --> 00:39:30.321
<i>It looks like a man!</i>

00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:33.201
<i>Shake him off! Roll! Roll!</i>

00:39:41.201 --> 00:39:42.361
<i>I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

00:39:42.481 --> 00:39:44.761
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

00:39:48.881 --> 00:39:50.881
<i>Punch out! Punch out!</i>

00:39:57.321 --> 00:39:59.081
<i>Whiplash One down.</i>

00:39:59.161 --> 00:40:00.721
Whiplash Two, do
you see a chute?

00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:03.081
<i>Negative! No chute, no chute!</i>

00:40:08.561 --> 00:40:09.961
<i>My chute's jammed!</i>

00:40:15.961 --> 00:40:18.321
<i>Sir, I've got a
visual on the bogey.</i>

00:40:18.401 --> 00:40:21.041
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

00:40:23.601 --> 00:40:25.441
Major, we don't even
know what we're shooting at.

00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:27.601
- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22

00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:29.001
inside a legal no fly zone!

00:40:29.081 --> 00:40:31.441
Whiplash Two, if you
have a clear shot, take it!

00:40:31.481 --> 00:40:33.881
<i>You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.</i>

00:40:33.921 --> 00:40:35.321
Keep going!

00:40:42.921 --> 00:40:44.961
<i>Good chute! Good chute!</i>

00:40:52.561 --> 00:40:54.281
Tony, you still there?

00:40:54.361 --> 00:40:55.441
<i>Hey, thanks.</i>

00:40:55.481 --> 00:40:58.121
Oh, my God, you
crazy son of a bitch.

00:40:58.921 --> 00:41:00.321
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

00:41:02.121 --> 00:41:04.601
Yeah, well, technically,
he hit me.

00:41:04.641 --> 00:41:06.241
<i>Now are you going to come
by and see what I'm working on?</i>

00:41:06.281 --> 00:41:09.201
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

00:41:09.361 --> 00:41:10.921
Now, what am I
supposed to tell the press?

00:41:10.961 --> 00:41:13.521
<i>Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?</i>

00:41:13.601 --> 00:41:15.321
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

00:41:16.121 --> 00:41:17.961
An unfortunate training exercise

00:41:18.041 --> 00:41:20.921
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:25.081
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

00:41:25.161 --> 00:41:29.081
<i>As for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in Gulmira,</i>

00:41:29.161 --> 00:41:32.641
<i>it is still unclear who
or what intervened,</i>

00:41:32.761 --> 00:41:36.881
<i>but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.</i>

00:42:29.428 --> 00:42:30.748
Where are they?

00:42:30.868 --> 00:42:32.148
Hiding,

00:42:32.268 --> 00:42:33.828
as cowards always do.

00:42:44.268 --> 00:42:48.548
You've come a long
way to die, Asgardians.

00:42:48.668 --> 00:42:51.148
I am Thor Odinson!

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:53.268
We know who you are.

00:42:53.548 --> 00:42:55.948
How did your people
get into Asgard?

00:43:05.308 --> 00:43:09.388
The House of Odin
is full of traitors.

00:43:09.508 --> 00:43:12.388
Do not dishonor my
father's name with your lies!

00:43:12.868 --> 00:43:15.908
Your father is a
murderer and a thief!

00:43:16.148 --> 00:43:19.348
And why have you come here?
To make peace?

00:43:19.668 --> 00:43:22.708
You long for battle.
You crave it.

00:43:23.348 --> 00:43:25.308
You're nothing but a boy

00:43:25.508 --> 00:43:27.988
trying to prove himself a man.

00:43:29.508 --> 00:43:32.708
Well, this "boy" has
grown tired of your mockery.

00:43:39.428 --> 00:43:41.828
Thor, stop and think.

00:43:42.068 --> 00:43:43.588
Look around you,
we're outnumbered.

00:43:43.708 --> 00:43:45.388
Know your place, Brother.

00:43:45.508 --> 00:43:49.068
You know not what your
actions would unleash.

00:43:51.748 --> 00:43:53.068
I do.

00:43:53.948 --> 00:43:57.948
Go now, while I still allow it.

00:44:08.788 --> 00:44:11.948
We will accept your
most gracious offer.

00:44:24.588 --> 00:44:26.068
Come on, Brother.

00:44:31.588 --> 00:44:33.788
Run back home, little princess.

00:44:34.268 --> 00:44:35.268
Damn.

00:44:40.788 --> 00:44:41.948
Next?

00:45:01.108 --> 00:45:03.308
At least make it a
challenge for me!

00:45:23.668 --> 00:45:25.708
That's more like it.

00:46:01.148 --> 00:46:02.788
Don't let them touch you!

00:46:44.388 --> 00:46:46.388
Thor!

00:46:47.868 --> 00:46:48.988
We must go!

00:46:49.068 --> 00:46:50.108
Then go!

00:47:13.468 --> 00:47:14.948
Run!

00:47:16.948 --> 00:47:18.268
Thor!

00:48:23.988 --> 00:48:25.348
Heimdall!

00:48:25.668 --> 00:48:27.348
Open the bridge!

00:49:32.868 --> 00:49:35.508
Father!
We'll finish them together!

00:49:35.708 --> 00:49:37.028
Silence!

00:49:42.788 --> 00:49:44.388
Allfather.

00:49:45.748 --> 00:49:47.908
You look weary.

00:49:49.748 --> 00:49:51.188
Laufey,

00:49:51.268 --> 00:49:53.068
end this now.

00:49:53.188 --> 00:49:55.268
Your boy sought this out.

00:49:55.908 --> 00:49:57.108
You're right.

00:49:58.748 --> 00:50:02.188
And these are the actions
of a boy, treat them as such.

00:50:02.588 --> 00:50:05.548
You and I can end
this here and now,

00:50:05.588 --> 00:50:06.948
before there's
further bloodshed.

00:50:07.068 --> 00:50:10.708
We are beyond
diplomacy now, Allfather.

00:50:12.148 --> 00:50:14.428
He'll get what he came for.

00:50:14.548 --> 00:50:15.588
War

00:50:16.148 --> 00:50:17.668
and death.

00:50:19.228 --> 00:50:20.788
So be it.

00:50:39.621 --> 00:50:40.701
<i>Hey!</i>

00:50:42.621 --> 00:50:44.501
<i>It is a tight fit, sir.</i>

00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:48.381
<i>Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.</i>

00:50:48.461 --> 00:50:50.381
Be gentle.
This is my first time.

00:50:51.301 --> 00:50:52.701
I designed this
to come off, so...

00:50:52.781 --> 00:50:54.141
Hey.

00:50:55.381 --> 00:50:57.661
I really should be able to...

00:50:57.701 --> 00:50:59.421
<i>Please, try not to move, sir.</i>

00:51:00.661 --> 00:51:02.981
What's going on here?

00:51:07.501 --> 00:51:11.581
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

00:51:12.101 --> 00:51:14.021
Are those bullet holes?

00:51:40.456 --> 00:51:41.736
Welcome.

00:51:45.096 --> 00:51:47.176
Compliments of Tony Stark.

00:51:48.096 --> 00:51:51.776
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

00:51:51.856 --> 00:51:53.936
You paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.

00:51:54.016 --> 00:51:55.776
Show me the weapon.

00:51:57.016 --> 00:52:00.496
Come. Leave your guards outside.

00:52:17.296 --> 00:52:19.816
His escape bore
unexpected fruit.

00:52:22.456 --> 00:52:24.456
So this is how he did it.

00:52:24.816 --> 00:52:27.296
This is only a
first, crude effort.

00:52:27.456 --> 00:52:29.816
Stark has perfected his design.

00:52:30.216 --> 00:52:32.736
He has made a
masterpiece of death.

00:52:33.376 --> 00:52:36.576
A man with a dozen of
these can rule all of Asia.

00:52:38.136 --> 00:52:40.496
And you dream of Stark's throne.

00:52:42.296 --> 00:52:44.536
We have a common enemy.

00:52:48.816 --> 00:52:50.816
If we are still in business,

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:55.536
I will give you these designs

00:52:57.056 --> 00:52:58.056
as a gift.

00:52:59.696 --> 00:53:01.136
And in turn,

00:53:02.776 --> 00:53:07.896
I hope you'll repay me
with a gift of iron soldiers.

00:53:24.856 --> 00:53:26.216
Technology.

00:53:28.056 --> 00:53:31.616
It's always been your Achilles'
heel in this part of the world.

00:53:32.816 --> 00:53:35.976
Don't worry.
It'll only last for 15 minutes.

00:53:37.216 --> 00:53:39.616
That's the least
of your problems.

00:53:44.896 --> 00:53:47.496
Crate up the armor
and the rest of it.

00:53:49.136 --> 00:53:51.176
All right, let's finish up here.

00:54:01.657 --> 00:54:02.777
Why did you bring us back?

00:54:02.897 --> 00:54:03.897
Do you realize what you've done?

00:54:03.937 --> 00:54:05.777
- What you've started?
- I was protecting my home.

00:54:05.857 --> 00:54:07.457
You cannot even
protect your friends!

00:54:07.497 --> 00:54:09.297
How can you hope
to protect a kingdom?

00:54:09.337 --> 00:54:11.057
Get him to the healing room!
Now!

00:54:11.137 --> 00:54:14.977
There won't be a kingdom to
protect if you're afraid to act.

00:54:15.657 --> 00:54:18.177
The Jotuns must
learn to fear me,

00:54:18.257 --> 00:54:19.737
just as they once feared you.

00:54:19.857 --> 00:54:22.257
That's pride and vanity
talking, not leadership.

00:54:22.417 --> 00:54:25.337
You've forgotten everything I taught
you about a warrior's patience.

00:54:25.457 --> 00:54:27.297
While you wait and be patient,

00:54:27.337 --> 00:54:29.137
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

00:54:29.417 --> 00:54:30.577
The old ways are done.

00:54:30.657 --> 00:54:33.297
You'd stand giving
speeches while Asgard falls.

00:54:33.417 --> 00:54:36.937
You are a vain,
greedy, cruel boy!

00:54:37.017 --> 00:54:40.017
And you are an
old man and a fool!

00:54:46.697 --> 00:54:48.017
Yes.

00:54:48.857 --> 00:54:50.537
I was a fool

00:54:51.617 --> 00:54:52.817
to think you were ready.

00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:54.537
Father...

00:54:58.057 --> 00:55:01.057
Thor Odinson,

00:55:02.817 --> 00:55:05.857
you have betrayed the
express command of your king.

00:55:06.177 --> 00:55:08.657
Through your
arrogance and stupidity,

00:55:08.817 --> 00:55:11.697
you've opened these peaceful
realms and innocent lives

00:55:11.737 --> 00:55:15.457
to the horror and
desolation of war!

00:55:21.537 --> 00:55:25.417
You are unworthy
of these realms!

00:55:25.697 --> 00:55:28.377
You're unworthy of your title!

00:55:28.417 --> 00:55:30.057
You're unworthy

00:55:32.697 --> 00:55:37.217
of the loved ones
you have betrayed.

00:55:47.537 --> 00:55:50.297
I now take from you your power!

00:55:50.777 --> 00:55:53.897
In the name of my father

00:55:53.937 --> 00:55:56.177
and his father before,

00:55:56.417 --> 00:55:59.097
I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!

00:56:05.857 --> 00:56:09.057
Whosoever holds this
hammer, if he be worthy,

00:56:09.097 --> 00:56:10.777
shall possess the power of Thor.
