00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:54.311
In case it's unclear…

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.611
if you try to escape…

00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:01.164
if you so much as scratch that glass…

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:14.878
it's 30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.859
You get how that works?

00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:21.910
Ant, boot.

00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:27.148
It's an impressive cage.

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:30.015
Not built, I think, for me.

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:33.378
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:34.980
Oh, I've heard.

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:37.987
<i>A mindless beast.</i>

00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:40.628
<i>Makes play he's still a man.</i>

00:01:41.363 --> 00:01:43.654
<i>How desperate are you…</i>

00:01:43.782 --> 00:01:46.994
<i>that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?</i>

00:01:47.077 --> 00:01:49.157
<i>How desperate am I?</i>

00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:51.582
You threaten my world with war.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:53.918
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.462
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.953
You have made me very desperate.

00:02:01.216 --> 00:02:03.268
You might not be glad that you did.

00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:09.268
It burns you to have come so close.

00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:12.489
To have the Tesseract…

00:02:12.572 --> 00:02:13.940
to have power…

00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:16.466
unlimited power.

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:18.406
And for what?

00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:23.427
<i>A warm light for all mankind to share.</i>

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.909
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.417
Well, let me know if real power
wants a magazine or something.

00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:14.459
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

00:03:14.542 --> 00:03:16.364
Loki's gonna drag this out.

00:03:16.627 --> 00:03:17.809
So…

00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:20.214
Thor, what's his play?

00:03:20.297 --> 00:03:22.776
He has an army called the Chitauri.

00:03:23.092 --> 00:03:25.536
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

00:03:26.428 --> 00:03:28.610
He means to lead them
against your people.

00:03:28.722 --> 00:03:30.387
They will win him the Earth…

00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:32.225
in return I suspect for the Tesseract.

00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:33.504
An army?

00:03:34.353 --> 00:03:35.937
From outer space.

00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:38.091
So, he's building another portal.

00:03:38.857 --> 00:03:40.656
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:41.618
Selvig?

00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:42.782
He's an astrophysicist.

00:03:42.865 --> 00:03:43.988
He's a friend.

00:03:44.071 --> 00:03:46.421
Loki has him under some kind of spell…

00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:47.950
along with one of ours.

00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:50.002
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

00:03:50.085 --> 00:03:51.304
He's not leading an army from here.

00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:53.080
I don't think we should be
focusing on Loki.

00:03:53.163 --> 00:03:55.041
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

00:03:55.124 --> 00:03:56.542
You could smell crazy on him.

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.594
Have care how you speak.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.340
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

00:04:01.423 --> 00:04:02.727
And he is my brother.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.004
He killed 80 people in two days.

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:06.636
He's adopted.

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.688
I think it's about the mechanics.

00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:11.265
Iridium. What do they need
the iridium for?

00:04:11.348 --> 00:04:12.475
It's a stabilizing agent.

00:04:12.558 --> 00:04:13.811
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

00:04:13.894 --> 00:04:15.441
I'll fly you to Portland.

00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:16.868
Keep love alive.

00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:19.359
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself…

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:20.861
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.072
No hard feelings, Point Break.

00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:24.631
You've got a mean swing.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.448
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide…

00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:30.034
and stay open as long,
as Loki wants.

00:04:31.043 --> 00:04:33.417
Raise the mizzenmast.
Jib the topsails.

00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:36.154
That man is playing Galaga.

00:04:36.874 --> 00:04:38.316
He thought we wouldn't notice…

00:04:38.775 --> 00:04:40.035
but we did.

00:04:42.123 --> 00:04:43.797
How does Fury even see these?

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.966
He turns.

00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:46.457
Sounds exhausting.

00:04:47.718 --> 00:04:49.053
The rest of the raw materials…

00:04:49.136 --> 00:04:51.759
Agent Barton can get his hands
on pretty easily.

00:04:52.097 --> 00:04:55.270
The only major component
he still needs is a power source…

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:57.311
of high-energy density.

00:04:57.394 --> 00:04:58.539
Something…

00:04:59.187 --> 00:05:00.754
to kick-start the Cube.

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.886
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:05.144
Last night.

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:07.228
The packet, Selvig's notes…

00:05:07.311 --> 00:05:08.864
the extraction theory papers.

00:05:08.947 --> 00:05:10.124
Am I the only one who did the reading?

00:05:10.207 --> 00:05:12.512
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

00:05:13.118 --> 00:05:15.966
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin…

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:17.608
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:20.114
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilize…

00:05:20.197 --> 00:05:21.377
the quantum tunneling effect.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.327
Well, if he could do that…

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.214
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

00:05:25.297 --> 00:05:27.658
Finally, someone who speaks English.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.715
Is that what just happened?

00:05:30.094 --> 00:05:31.893
It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

00:05:32.304 --> 00:05:35.438
Your work on anti electron
collisions is unparalleled.

00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:37.518
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control…

00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:39.778
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

00:05:41.188 --> 00:05:41.716
Thanks.

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:45.026
Dr. Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:46.527
I was hoping you might join him.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.862
I would start with that stick of his.

00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:50.483
It may be magical but it works
an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:53.743
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

00:05:53.826 --> 00:05:55.785
And I would like to know
how Loki used it…

00:05:55.868 --> 00:05:57.455
to turn two of the sharpest men I know…

00:05:57.538 --> 00:05:59.582
into his personal flying monkeys.

00:05:59.665 --> 00:06:00.877
Monkeys?

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:02.551
I do not understand.
I do.

00:06:05.337 --> 00:06:07.264
I understood that reference.

00:06:08.132 --> 00:06:09.543
Shall we play, Doctor?

00:06:09.675 --> 00:06:11.002
This way, sir.

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:27.068
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent…

00:06:27.151 --> 00:06:29.244
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

00:06:29.403 --> 00:06:31.322
But it's going
to take weeks to process.

00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:32.696
If we bypass their mainframe…

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.116
and direct route to the Homer cluster…

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.308
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:40.560
All I packed was a toothbrush.

00:06:41.498 --> 00:06:43.218
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

00:06:43.301 --> 00:06:45.546
Top ten floors, all R&amp;D.

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:47.254
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

00:06:47.337 --> 00:06:50.007
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York I…

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.465
kind of broke…

00:06:51.674 --> 00:06:52.760
Harlem.

00:06:52.843 --> 00:06:54.762
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

00:06:54.845 --> 00:06:56.980
No tension, no surprises.

00:06:58.182 --> 00:06:59.723
Hey!
Nothing?

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:00.768
Are you nuts?

00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:01.977
Jury's out.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.481
You really have got a lid on it,
haven't you?

00:07:03.564 --> 00:07:04.650
What's your secret?
Mellow jazz?

00:07:04.733 --> 00:07:06.072
Bongo drums, huge bag of weed?

00:07:06.155 --> 00:07:07.400
Is everything a joke to you?

00:07:07.483 --> 00:07:08.499
Funny things are.

00:07:08.582 --> 00:07:11.608
Threatening the safety of everyone
on this ship isn't funny.

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:13.498
No offense, Doc.
It's alright…

00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:15.562
I wouldn't have come aboard
if I couldn't handle…

00:07:15.645 --> 00:07:17.129
pointy things.

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:19.257
You're tip-toeing, big man.

00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:20.287
You need to strut.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.018
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr. Stark.

00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:23.210
Do you think I'm not?

00:07:23.791 --> 00:07:26.627
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.211
What isn't he telling us?

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.589
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

00:07:30.672 --> 00:07:32.258
You think Fury's hiding something?

00:07:32.341 --> 00:07:33.426
He's a spy.

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:35.447
Captain, he's the spy.

00:07:35.594 --> 00:07:37.296
His secrets have secrets.

00:07:37.513 --> 00:07:39.135
It's bugging him, too.
Isn't it?

00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:43.510
I just want to finish my work here, and…

00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:44.785
Doctor?

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.319
A warm light for all mankind.

00:07:52.402 --> 00:07:54.731
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

00:07:54.814 --> 00:07:55.693
I heard it.

00:07:55.776 --> 00:07:57.611
Well, I think that was meant for you.

00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:01.355
Even if Barton didn't tell Loki…

00:08:01.438 --> 00:08:03.456
about the tower,
it was still all over the news.

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:04.899
The Stark Tower?

00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:06.500
That big, ugly…

00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:08.345
building in New York?

00:08:08.428 --> 00:08:11.382
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.389
That building will run itself for,
what, a year?

00:08:14.716 --> 00:08:16.352
It's just the prototype.

00:08:16.635 --> 00:08:18.975
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

00:08:19.107 --> 00:08:19.966
That's what he's getting at.

00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:23.284
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring
him in on the Tesseract project?

00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:26.536
What are they doing in the energy
business in the first place?

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.595
I should probably look into that
once my decryption program…

00:08:29.678 --> 00:08:32.239
finishes breaking into
all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:32.935
I'm sorry, did you say…

00:08:33.018 --> 00:08:35.196
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:38.299
In a few hours, I'll know every dirty
secret S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

00:08:38.382 --> 00:08:38.993
Blueberry?

00:08:39.076 --> 00:08:41.327
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.388
An intelligence organization
that fears intelligence.

00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:45.998
Historically, not awesome.

00:08:46.081 --> 00:08:48.175
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

00:08:48.512 --> 00:08:50.131
This is a man who means to start a war…

00:08:50.214 --> 00:08:52.295
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:54.337
We have orders.

00:08:54.548 --> 00:08:55.863
We should follow them.

00:08:55.966 --> 00:08:57.701
Following's not really my style.

00:08:59.177 --> 00:09:00.945
And you're all about style, aren't you?

00:09:01.703 --> 00:09:02.602
Of the people in this room…

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:04.517
which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit…

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.935
and, B, not of use?

00:09:06.018 --> 00:09:10.447
Steve, tell me none of this smells
a little funky to you.

00:09:13.255 --> 00:09:14.639
Just find the Cube.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.132
That's the guy my dad
never shut up about?

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:31.652
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

00:09:33.045 --> 00:09:34.797
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.647
He does have the jump on us.

00:09:36.798 --> 00:09:39.707
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

00:09:39.928 --> 00:09:41.470
It's going to blow up in his face.

00:09:41.553 --> 00:09:43.696
And I'm going to be there when it does.

00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:46.250
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

00:09:48.352 --> 00:09:50.348
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

00:09:51.355 --> 00:09:52.547
You see…

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.719
I don't get a suit of armor.

00:09:55.025 --> 00:09:56.361
I'm exposed.

00:09:57.154 --> 00:09:58.445
Like a nerve.

00:09:58.528 --> 00:10:00.056
It's a nightmare.

00:10:00.364 --> 00:10:02.445
You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel…

00:10:02.528 --> 00:10:05.139
trying every second
to crawl its way into my heart.

00:10:05.452 --> 00:10:07.140
This stops it.

00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:09.004
This little circle of light…

00:10:09.087 --> 00:10:10.355
it's part of me now…

00:10:11.056 --> 00:10:12.351
not just armor.

00:10:13.502 --> 00:10:15.839
It's a terrible privilege.

00:10:16.296 --> 00:10:17.720
But you can control it.

00:10:17.803 --> 00:10:18.712
Because I learned how.

00:10:18.795 --> 00:10:20.050
It's different.

00:10:20.133 --> 00:10:21.133
Hey…

00:10:21.368 --> 00:10:23.420
I read all about your accident.

00:10:23.553 --> 00:10:25.188
That much gamma exposure…

00:10:25.271 --> 00:10:26.659
should have killed you.

00:10:27.057 --> 00:10:29.186
So you're saying that the Hulk…

00:10:30.978 --> 00:10:33.446
The other guy saved my life?

00:10:33.647 --> 00:10:34.975
That's nice.

00:10:35.728 --> 00:10:37.075
It's a nice sentiment.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.489
Saved it for…

00:10:38.597 --> 00:10:39.605
what?

00:10:40.904 --> 00:10:42.400
I guess we'll find out.

00:10:44.574 --> 00:10:46.131
You may not enjoy that.

00:10:46.368 --> 00:10:47.910
And you just might.

00:11:47.554 --> 00:11:50.614
As soon as Loki took the doctor,
we moved Jane Foster.

00:11:50.932 --> 00:11:53.289
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

00:11:53.372 --> 00:11:56.584
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

00:11:57.042 --> 00:11:59.154
Handsome fee, private plane…

00:11:59.237 --> 00:12:00.677
very remote.

00:12:01.651 --> 00:12:02.790
She'll be safe.

00:12:02.873 --> 00:12:04.053
Thank you.

00:12:06.114 --> 00:12:08.249
It's no accident,
Loki taking Erik Selvig.

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:11.499
I dread what he plans
for him once he's done.

00:12:11.743 --> 00:12:13.095
Erik is a good man.

00:12:13.178 --> 00:12:14.591
He talks about you a lot.

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:17.601
You changed his life.

00:12:19.669 --> 00:12:21.592
You changed everything around here.

00:12:21.733 --> 00:12:23.520
They were better as they were.

00:12:24.424 --> 00:12:27.442
We pretend on Asgard that we're
more advanced but we…

00:12:27.735 --> 00:12:30.265
we come here, battling like bilge snipe.

00:12:30.472 --> 00:12:32.332
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

00:12:32.432 --> 00:12:35.255
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:38.105
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

00:12:38.188 --> 00:12:40.007
Well, they are repulsive.

00:12:41.358 --> 00:12:43.535
And they trample everything
in their path.

00:12:51.326 --> 00:12:53.102
When I first came to Earth…

00:12:53.185 --> 00:12:54.864
Loki's rage followed me here…

00:12:54.947 --> 00:12:56.616
and your people paid the price.

00:12:57.207 --> 00:12:58.680
And now again.

00:13:01.545 --> 00:13:03.648
In my youth, I courted war.

00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:07.594
War hasn't started yet.

00:13:08.927 --> 00:13:12.019
You think you could make Loki tell us
where the Tesseract is?

00:13:12.102 --> 00:13:13.634
I do not know.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:15.559
Loki's mind is far afield.

00:13:15.642 --> 00:13:19.497
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.915
There's no pain would praise
his need from him.

00:13:23.692 --> 00:13:25.529
A lot of guys think that…

00:13:26.085 --> 00:13:27.903
until the pain starts.

00:13:29.823 --> 00:13:31.325
What are you asking me to do?

00:13:31.408 --> 00:13:35.095
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

00:13:35.178 --> 00:13:36.253
Loki is a prisoner.

00:13:36.336 --> 00:13:40.432
Then why do I feel like he's the only person
on this boat that wants to be here?

00:13:52.929 --> 00:13:55.596
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

00:13:56.183 --> 00:13:58.067
But you figured I'd come.

00:13:58.518 --> 00:13:59.936
After.

00:14:00.937 --> 00:14:04.231
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct…

00:14:04.524 --> 00:14:06.472
you would appear as a friend…

00:14:06.658 --> 00:14:08.233
as a balm.

00:14:09.112 --> 00:14:10.864
And I would cooperate.

00:14:10.947 --> 00:14:13.091
I want to know what you've done
to Agent Barton.

00:14:13.174 --> 00:14:15.310
I would say I've expanded his mind.

00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:19.623
And once you've won…

00:14:20.123 --> 00:14:21.758
once you're king of the mountain…

00:14:23.877 --> 00:14:26.054
what happens to his mind?

00:14:27.631 --> 00:14:29.466
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

00:14:29.549 --> 00:14:32.477
Love is for children.
I owe him a debt.

00:14:36.264 --> 00:14:37.592
Tell me.

00:14:42.479 --> 00:14:45.980
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D. I have…

00:14:48.151 --> 00:14:49.210
Well…

00:14:49.568 --> 00:14:51.563
I made a name for myself.

00:14:52.155 --> 00:14:54.797
I have a very specific skill set.

00:14:55.325 --> 00:14:57.490
I didn't care who I used it for…

00:14:57.915 --> 00:14:59.069
or on.

00:14:59.996 --> 00:15:02.676
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

00:15:04.668 --> 00:15:06.874
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.306
He made a different call.

00:15:12.133 --> 00:15:14.923
And what will you do if
I vow to spare him?

00:15:15.428 --> 00:15:16.517
Not let you out.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.540
No, but I like this.

00:15:19.808 --> 00:15:23.270
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

00:15:23.353 --> 00:15:25.349
Regimes fall every day.

00:15:25.522 --> 00:15:27.900
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

00:15:27.983 --> 00:15:29.325
Or I was.

00:15:30.527 --> 00:15:32.077
And what are you now?

00:15:32.654 --> 00:15:34.915
It's really not that complicated.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.537
I got red in my ledger…

00:15:37.743 --> 00:15:39.612
I'd like to wipe it out.

00:15:40.751 --> 00:15:41.845
Can you?

00:15:43.707 --> 00:15:46.837
Can you wipe out that much red?

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.412
Dreykov's daughter…

00:15:51.881 --> 00:15:53.320
São Paulo…

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:56.399
the hospital fire?

00:15:58.096 --> 00:16:00.057
Barton told me everything.

00:16:00.557 --> 00:16:02.468
Your ledger is dripping.

00:16:02.551 --> 00:16:03.702
It's gushing red…

00:16:03.785 --> 00:16:07.814
and you think saving a man no more virtuous
than yourself will change anything?

00:16:07.897 --> 00:16:10.524
This is the basest sentimentality.

00:16:10.734 --> 00:16:12.986
This is a child at prayer.

00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:14.537
Pathetic!

00:16:15.165 --> 00:16:17.331
You lie and kill…

00:16:17.907 --> 00:16:21.294
in the service of liars and killers.

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:25.502
You pretend to be separate…

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:27.251
to have your own code…

00:16:27.334 --> 00:16:29.746
something that makes up
for the horrors.

00:16:31.133 --> 00:16:32.884
But they are part of you.

00:16:33.757 --> 00:16:36.802
And they will never go away.

00:16:38.571 --> 00:16:39.663
I won't touch Barton…

00:16:39.746 --> 00:16:41.541
not until I make him kill you.

00:16:41.624 --> 00:16:44.017
Slowly, intimately…

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.561
in every way he knows you fear.

00:16:46.644 --> 00:16:49.640
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work…

00:16:49.723 --> 00:16:52.807
and when he screams,
I'll split his skull.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.170
This is my bargain,
you mewling quim.

00:16:58.114 --> 00:16:59.694
You're a monster.

00:17:01.951 --> 00:17:03.453
Oh, no.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.092
You brought the monster.

00:17:08.917 --> 00:17:10.744
So, Banner.

00:17:11.294 --> 00:17:12.813
That's your play.

00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:14.200
What?

00:17:14.557 --> 00:17:16.341
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

00:17:16.424 --> 00:17:17.968
Keep Banner in the lab.
I'm on my way.

00:17:18.051 --> 00:17:19.435
Send Thor as well.

00:17:20.967 --> 00:17:22.185
Thank you…

00:17:22.402 --> 00:17:24.278
for your cooperation.

00:17:32.107 --> 00:17:33.866
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

00:17:34.174 --> 00:17:36.367
Kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.085
You're supposed to be
locating the Tesseract.

00:17:38.168 --> 00:17:39.559
We are.
The model's locked…

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:41.279
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

00:17:41.362 --> 00:17:42.341
When we get a hit…

00:17:42.424 --> 00:17:44.578
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

00:17:44.661 --> 00:17:48.115
Yeah, then you get your Cube back.
No muss, no fuss.

00:17:48.998 --> 00:17:50.472
What is Phase 2?

00:17:52.377 --> 00:17:55.145
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses
the Cube to make weapons.

00:17:55.228 --> 00:17:57.340
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

00:17:57.423 --> 00:17:59.886
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

00:17:59.969 --> 00:18:02.387
- This does not mean that we're making…
- I'm sorry, Nick.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.148
What were you lying?

00:18:04.931 --> 00:18:06.297
I was wrong, Director.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.562
The world hasn't changed a bit.

00:18:07.645 --> 00:18:08.769
Did you know about this?

00:18:08.852 --> 00:18:10.439
You want to think about
removing yourself…

00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:11.730
from this environment, Doctor?

00:18:11.813 --> 00:18:13.899
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

00:18:13.982 --> 00:18:15.285
Loki is manipulating you.

00:18:15.368 --> 00:18:16.727
And you've been doing what, exactly?

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.739
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

00:18:18.822 --> 00:18:19.708
Yes, and I'm not leaving…

00:18:19.791 --> 00:18:21.333
because suddenly you get a little twitchy.

00:18:21.416 --> 00:18:23.215
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:18:23.298 --> 00:18:26.785
is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

00:18:27.662 --> 00:18:29.130
Because of him.

00:18:30.106 --> 00:18:31.291
Me?

00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:34.294
Last year, Earth had
a visitor from another planet…

00:18:34.377 --> 00:18:37.756
who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town.

00:18:37.839 --> 00:18:40.092
We learned that not only
are we not alone…

00:18:40.175 --> 00:18:43.804
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

00:18:43.887 --> 00:18:45.933
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

00:18:46.016 --> 00:18:48.123
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

00:18:48.206 --> 00:18:50.310
And you're not the only threat.

00:18:50.393 --> 00:18:53.696
The world's filling up with people
who can't be matched…

00:18:54.063 --> 00:18:55.501
that can't be controlled.

00:18:55.584 --> 00:18:56.670
Like you controlled the Cube?

00:18:56.753 --> 00:18:59.524
Your work with the Tesseract
is what drew Loki to it…

00:18:59.607 --> 00:19:00.821
and his allies.

00:19:00.904 --> 00:19:05.158
It is a signal to all the realms that the
Earth is ready for a higher form of war.

00:19:05.241 --> 00:19:06.326
A higher form?

00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:07.536
You forced our hand.

00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:09.578
- We had to come up with something.
- A nuclear deterrent.

00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:11.873
Because that always calms
everything right down.

00:19:11.956 --> 00:19:14.376
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

00:19:14.459 --> 00:19:16.658
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep…

00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:18.502
Wait, wait. Hold on.
How is this now about me?

00:19:18.585 --> 00:19:19.840
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

00:19:19.923 --> 00:19:21.883
I thought humans
were more evolved than this.

00:19:21.966 --> 00:19:24.886
Excuse me, did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up?

00:19:24.969 --> 00:19:26.772
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

00:19:26.855 --> 00:19:28.473
Are you boys really that naive?

00:19:28.556 --> 00:19:30.475
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

00:19:30.558 --> 00:19:31.838
Captain America's on threat watch?

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:32.841
We all are.

00:19:32.924 --> 00:19:34.344
Wait, you're on that list?

00:19:34.427 --> 00:19:36.231
Are you above or below angry bees?

00:19:36.314 --> 00:19:38.483
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack…

00:19:38.566 --> 00:19:39.860
Threat! Verbal threat.
I feel threatened.

00:19:39.943 --> 00:19:41.897
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?

00:19:49.786 --> 00:19:51.118
<i>Transport Six-Six-Bravo…</i>

00:19:51.201 --> 00:19:52.747
<i>please relay confirm codes.</i>

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.041
<i>I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.</i>

00:19:55.124 --> 00:19:57.106
<i>What is your haul?
Over.</i>

00:19:57.293 --> 00:19:59.538
<i>Arms and ammunition.
Over.</i>

00:20:08.304 --> 00:20:10.494
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

00:20:10.577 --> 00:20:12.201
That's his M.O., isn't it?

00:20:12.397 --> 00:20:13.649
I mean, what are we, a team?

00:20:13.732 --> 00:20:16.722
No, no, no, we're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

00:20:16.805 --> 00:20:18.899
We're… We're a time bomb.

00:20:18.982 --> 00:20:20.901
You need to step away.

00:20:20.984 --> 00:20:22.779
Why shouldn't
the guy let off a little steam?

00:20:22.862 --> 00:20:25.025
You know damn well why.
Back off!

00:20:25.154 --> 00:20:27.108
I'm starting to want you to make me.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.287
Yeah.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.599
Big man in a suit of armor.

00:20:31.286 --> 00:20:32.887
Take that off, what are you?

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.564
Genius, billionaire, playboy,
philanthropist.

00:20:35.996 --> 00:20:38.695
I know guys with none
of that worth ten of you.

00:20:39.168 --> 00:20:40.420
I've seen the footage.

00:20:40.503 --> 00:20:42.960
The only thing you really fight
for is yourself.

00:20:43.991 --> 00:20:46.176
You're not the guy to make
the sacrifice play…

00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:48.715
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

00:20:48.798 --> 00:20:50.590
I think I would just cut the wire.

00:20:53.562 --> 00:20:55.214
Always a way out.

00:20:55.977 --> 00:20:57.189
You know you may not be a threat…

00:20:57.272 --> 00:20:59.272
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero.

00:20:59.355 --> 00:21:01.575
A hero?
Like you?

00:21:01.983 --> 00:21:04.069
You're a laboratory
experiment, Rogers.

00:21:04.152 --> 00:21:07.279
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

00:21:33.056 --> 00:21:35.360
Put on the suit.
Let's go a few rounds.

00:21:36.893 --> 00:21:38.855
You people are so petty…

00:21:39.479 --> 00:21:40.456
and tiny.

00:21:40.539 --> 00:21:41.523
Yeah, this is a team.

00:21:41.606 --> 00:21:42.988
Agent Romanoff, would you escort.

00:21:43.071 --> 00:21:44.890
- Dr. Banner back to his…
- Where?

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:45.944
You rented my room.

00:21:46.027 --> 00:21:47.821
The cell was just in case…

00:21:47.904 --> 00:21:49.074
In case you needed to kill me.

00:21:49.157 --> 00:21:51.723
But you can't.
I know, I tried.

00:21:54.911 --> 00:21:56.223
I got low.

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:57.917
I didn't see an end…

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.582
so I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

00:22:03.048 --> 00:22:04.138
So I moved on.

00:22:04.221 --> 00:22:07.173
I focused on helping other people.
I was good.

00:22:07.256 --> 00:22:09.853
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show…

00:22:09.936 --> 00:22:11.176
and put everyone here at risk.

00:22:11.259 --> 00:22:13.181
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?

00:22:13.264 --> 00:22:15.149
You want to know how I stay calm?

00:22:17.975 --> 00:22:19.479
Dr. Banner…

00:22:20.804 --> 00:22:22.512
put down the scepter.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.170
Got it.

00:22:33.379 --> 00:22:36.104
Sorry kids, you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

00:22:36.187 --> 00:22:37.896
- You located the Tesseract?
- I could get there fastest.

00:22:37.979 --> 00:22:40.377
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.860
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?

00:22:41.943 --> 00:22:42.934
Put on the suit, let's find out.

00:22:43.017 --> 00:22:44.466
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:45.850
Put on the suit.

00:22:48.423 --> 00:22:49.799
Oh, my God.

00:23:05.565 --> 00:23:06.384
Put on the suit.

00:23:06.467 --> 00:23:07.467
Yeah.

00:23:10.737 --> 00:23:12.488
<i>All hands to stations.</i>

00:23:16.617 --> 00:23:18.272
- Hill!
<i>- External detonation.</i>

00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:20.711
Number three engine is down.

00:23:20.997 --> 00:23:22.337
Can they get it running?

00:23:23.031 --> 00:23:25.126
- Talk to me.
- Turbine looks mostly intact…

00:23:25.209 --> 00:23:28.490
but it's impossible to get out there
to make repairs while we're in the air.

00:23:28.755 --> 00:23:31.040
If we lose one more engine,
we won't be.

00:23:31.424 --> 00:23:33.444
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

00:23:33.527 --> 00:23:35.303
- Stark, you copy that?
<i>- I'm on it.</i>

00:23:35.386 --> 00:23:37.639
Coulson, initiate defensive lock down…

00:23:37.722 --> 00:23:40.153
in the detention section
then get to the armory.

00:23:40.236 --> 00:23:41.579
Romanoff?

00:23:44.687 --> 00:23:45.920
We're ok.

00:23:48.483 --> 00:23:50.005
We're ok, right?

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.832
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.

00:24:03.915 --> 00:24:05.578
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:07.238
- Got it.
- Stay close.

00:24:09.295 --> 00:24:11.138
Let's go, Level 4.

00:24:11.714 --> 00:24:13.942
- Engine three.
- I'll meet you there.

00:24:22.725 --> 00:24:23.984
Doctor?

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.251
Bruce?

00:24:27.563 --> 00:24:28.855
You got to fight it.

00:24:28.938 --> 00:24:30.907
This is just what Loki wants.

00:24:32.388 --> 00:24:33.856
We're going to be ok.
Listen to me.

00:24:34.372 --> 00:24:35.593
Are you hurt?

00:24:38.201 --> 00:24:39.184
We're going to be ok.

00:24:39.267 --> 00:24:40.325
Alright?

00:24:40.408 --> 00:24:42.051
I swear on my life…

00:24:42.134 --> 00:24:43.194
I will get you out of this.

00:24:43.277 --> 00:24:44.706
You will walk away and never ever…

00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:46.329
Your life?

00:25:03.309 --> 00:25:04.610
Bruce.

00:25:41.157 --> 00:25:44.348
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0,
heading south!

00:25:44.557 --> 00:25:46.476
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:48.518
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

00:25:48.601 --> 00:25:50.403
Is the sun coming up?

00:25:51.188 --> 00:25:53.516
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.

00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:55.235
Get us over water.

00:25:55.318 --> 00:25:57.544
One more turbine goes down,
and we drop.

00:26:04.285 --> 00:26:05.404
Stark!

00:26:08.164 --> 00:26:09.700
Stark, I'm here!

00:26:09.957 --> 00:26:11.467
<i>Good.</i>

00:26:12.668 --> 00:26:14.035
<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>

00:26:14.795 --> 00:26:17.590
I got to get this superconducting
coolant system back online…

00:26:17.673 --> 00:26:19.217
before I can access the rotors…

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.185
work on dislodging the debris.

00:26:23.387 --> 00:26:25.398
<i>I need you to get to that
engine control panel…</i>

00:26:25.481 --> 00:26:27.737
<i>and tell me which relays
are in overload position.</i>

00:26:41.228 --> 00:26:42.684
<i>What does it look like in there?</i>

00:26:43.574 --> 00:26:46.097
It seems to run on some form
of electricity.

00:26:46.202 --> 00:26:47.770
Well, you're not wrong.

00:27:51.809 --> 00:27:54.520
We are not your enemies, Banner.

00:27:54.603 --> 00:27:56.599
Try to think!

00:28:05.906 --> 00:28:07.763
<i>Ok, the relays are intact.</i>

00:28:07.908 --> 00:28:09.224
What's our next move?

00:28:09.307 --> 00:28:10.495
<i>Even if I clear the rotors…</i>

00:28:10.578 --> 00:28:12.816
<i>this thing won't re-engage
without a jump.</i>

00:28:12.955 --> 00:28:14.296
I'm going to have to get in there and push.

00:28:14.379 --> 00:28:16.250
If that thing gets up to speed,
you'll get shredded.

00:28:16.333 --> 00:28:18.378
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity…

00:28:18.461 --> 00:28:19.879
long enough to disengage
Maglev and that could…

00:28:19.962 --> 00:28:21.430
Speak English!

00:28:22.756 --> 00:28:24.335
You see that red lever?

00:28:25.092 --> 00:28:27.174
<i>It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.</i>

00:28:27.257 --> 00:28:29.545
Stand by it.
Wait for my word.

00:29:21.638 --> 00:29:23.786
We need full evac
on the lower hangar bay.

00:29:26.737 --> 00:29:28.122
Grenade!

00:29:42.878 --> 00:29:44.297
<i>We've got a perimeter breach!</i>

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.384
<i>Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.</i>

00:29:46.467 --> 00:29:48.097
<i>Call-outs at every junction.</i>

00:29:55.797 --> 00:29:58.190
<i>We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.</i>

00:29:58.273 --> 00:29:59.854
<i>Levels 2 and 3 are dark.</i>

00:29:59.937 --> 00:30:02.197
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

00:30:03.447 --> 00:30:04.399
Get his attention.

00:30:04.482 --> 00:30:08.473
Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone
and engage hostile.

00:30:08.696 --> 00:30:10.031
Don't get too close.

00:30:10.114 --> 00:30:11.336
<i>Copy.</i>

00:30:23.419 --> 00:30:24.786
<i>Target acquired.</i>

00:30:29.008 --> 00:30:30.529
<i>Target engaged.</i>

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.685
<i>Target angry, target angry!</i>

00:31:51.674 --> 00:31:54.059
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell…

00:32:12.278 --> 00:32:14.300
<i>Engine one is now in shut-down.</i>

00:32:22.955 --> 00:32:25.118
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

00:32:25.201 --> 00:32:27.513
<i>Sir, we've lost all power
in engine one.</i>

00:32:27.668 --> 00:32:29.545
<i>It's Barton.
He took out our systems.</i>

00:32:29.628 --> 00:32:31.618
<i>He's headed for the detention level.</i>

00:32:32.214 --> 00:32:33.827
<i>Does anybody copy?</i>

00:32:35.384 --> 00:32:37.024
This is Agent Romanoff.

00:32:37.636 --> 00:32:38.916
I copy.

00:32:43.434 --> 00:32:44.769
<i>Stark, we're losing altitude.</i>

00:32:44.852 --> 00:32:46.403
Yeah, I noticed.

00:33:15.215 --> 00:33:16.516
No!

00:33:23.974 --> 00:33:26.433
Are you ever not going
to fall for that?

00:34:09.645 --> 00:34:11.845
The humans think us immortal.

00:34:13.023 --> 00:34:14.534
Should we test that?

00:34:17.236 --> 00:34:18.620
Move away, please.

00:34:22.968 --> 00:34:24.238
You like this?

00:34:25.494 --> 00:34:28.645
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

00:34:29.957 --> 00:34:31.986
Even I don't know what it does.

00:34:32.915 --> 00:34:34.509
Do you want to find out?

00:34:36.255 --> 00:34:37.806
No!

00:35:47.195 --> 00:35:48.457
Natasha?

00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:21.647
You're going to lose.

00:36:24.029 --> 00:36:25.283
Am I?

00:36:26.532 --> 00:36:28.328
It's in your nature.

00:36:31.203 --> 00:36:33.121
Your heroes are scattered.

00:36:33.664 --> 00:36:36.666
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

00:36:37.501 --> 00:36:39.094
Where is my disadvantage?

00:36:39.795 --> 00:36:41.930
You lack conviction.

00:36:42.721 --> 00:36:43.808
I don't think I'm…

00:36:50.556 --> 00:36:52.278
So, that's what it does.

00:36:54.351 --> 00:36:57.334
<i>All hands to crash
stations immediately.</i>

00:37:24.798 --> 00:37:26.099
Cap, hit the lever.

00:37:26.466 --> 00:37:28.335
I need a minute here!

00:37:29.136 --> 00:37:30.262
Lever.

00:37:30.345 --> 00:37:31.646
Now!

00:37:43.483 --> 00:37:44.951
<i>Help!</i>

00:38:20.228 --> 00:38:21.647
Sorry, boss.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:23.235
The god rabbited.

00:38:23.828 --> 00:38:25.067
Just stay awake.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.819
Eyes on me.

00:38:26.902 --> 00:38:28.487
No, I'm clocking out here.

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.038
Not an option.

00:38:31.073 --> 00:38:32.717
It's ok, boss.

00:38:34.951 --> 00:38:36.734
This was never gonna work…

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.768
if they didn't have something…

00:38:39.748 --> 00:38:40.859
to…

00:39:10.404 --> 00:39:12.319
<i>Agent Coulson is down.</i>

00:39:13.615 --> 00:39:15.304
<i>A medical team is on
its way to your location.</i>

00:39:15.387 --> 00:39:16.440
<i>They're here.</i>

00:39:20.122 --> 00:39:21.232
They called it.

00:39:38.014 --> 00:39:40.683
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

00:39:43.019 --> 00:39:45.488
I guess he never did get you to sign them.

00:39:48.817 --> 00:39:50.527
We're dead in the air up here.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:51.698
Our communications…

00:39:51.781 --> 00:39:53.535
the location of the Cube…

00:39:54.114 --> 00:39:56.338
Banner, Thor…

00:39:57.625 --> 00:39:59.347
I got nothing for you.

00:39:59.578 --> 00:40:01.866
I lost my one good eye.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.261
Maybe I had that coming.

00:40:12.758 --> 00:40:14.085
Yes…

00:40:15.177 --> 00:40:18.506
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

00:40:20.015 --> 00:40:22.017
I never put all my chips
on that number, though…

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.570
because I was playing
something even riskier.

00:40:29.024 --> 00:40:30.332
There was an idea…

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.144
Stark knows this…

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.898
called the Avengers Initiative.

00:40:39.618 --> 00:40:41.706
The idea was to bring together a group…

00:40:41.789 --> 00:40:44.192
of remarkable people…

00:40:45.207 --> 00:40:47.546
to see if they could
become something more.

00:40:49.377 --> 00:40:52.695
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to…

00:40:53.438 --> 00:40:56.029
to fight the battles that we never could.

00:40:59.805 --> 00:41:04.088
Phil Coulson died still
believing in that idea.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.530
In heroes.

00:41:16.738 --> 00:41:17.968
Well…

00:41:19.113 --> 00:41:21.222
it's an old-fashioned notion.

00:41:42.138 --> 00:41:44.299
<i>You fell out of the sky.</i>

00:41:58.626 --> 00:41:59.941
Did I hurt anybody?

00:42:00.699 --> 00:42:02.881
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

00:42:03.451 --> 00:42:06.389
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

00:42:07.622 --> 00:42:08.648
Lucky.

00:42:08.731 --> 00:42:10.528
Or just good aim.

00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:12.504
You were awake when you fell.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.048
You saw?
The whole thing.

00:42:16.131 --> 00:42:17.935
Right through the ceiling.

00:42:18.133 --> 00:42:21.608
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

00:42:22.178 --> 00:42:23.225
Here.

00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:28.802
Didn't think those would fit you until
you shrunk down to a regular-size feller.

00:42:31.771 --> 00:42:33.106
Thank you.

00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:35.687
Are you an alien?

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:37.051
What?

00:42:37.362 --> 00:42:39.213
From outer space, an alien.

00:42:39.296 --> 00:42:40.410
No.

00:42:40.739 --> 00:42:42.356
Well then, son…

00:42:42.439 --> 00:42:44.165
you've got a condition.

00:42:54.461 --> 00:42:55.549
Clint.

00:42:55.936 --> 00:42:57.354
You're going to be alright.

00:43:00.342 --> 00:43:01.768
You know that?

00:43:03.303 --> 00:43:04.976
Is that what you know?

00:43:07.641 --> 00:43:08.641
I've…

00:43:09.063 --> 00:43:10.590
got no window.

00:43:11.289 --> 00:43:13.007
I have to flush him out.

00:43:13.563 --> 00:43:15.440
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

00:43:15.523 --> 00:43:17.100
You don't understand.

00:43:19.027 --> 00:43:21.938
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

00:43:23.073 --> 00:43:24.440
Pull you out…

00:43:24.923 --> 00:43:26.745
and stuff something else in?

00:43:30.413 --> 00:43:32.584
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

00:43:34.376 --> 00:43:35.833
You know that I do.

00:43:44.387 --> 00:43:45.764
Why am I back?

00:43:46.318 --> 00:43:47.892
How did you get him out?

00:43:48.014 --> 00:43:49.928
Cognitive recalibration.

00:43:50.859 --> 00:43:52.703
I hit you really hard on the head.

00:43:54.064 --> 00:43:55.311
Thanks.

00:43:59.192 --> 00:44:00.363
Natasha…

00:44:01.723 --> 00:44:03.781
- How many agents did I…
- Don't.

00:44:04.406 --> 00:44:06.449
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.713
This is Loki.

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.137
This is…

00:44:10.236 --> 00:44:11.566
monsters and magic…

00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:13.682
and nothing we were ever trained for.

00:44:13.765 --> 00:44:15.333
Loki, did he get away?

00:44:15.416 --> 00:44:16.423
Yeah.

00:44:16.543 --> 00:44:18.292
I don't suppose you know where.

00:44:18.873 --> 00:44:20.349
I didn't need to know.

00:44:20.839 --> 00:44:22.165
I didn't ask.

00:44:25.844 --> 00:44:27.835
He's going to make
his play soon, though.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:29.766
Today.

00:44:29.849 --> 00:44:31.275
We got to stop him.

00:44:31.722 --> 00:44:32.976
Yeah?
Who's we?

00:44:33.059 --> 00:44:35.194
I don't know.
Whoever's left.

00:44:36.255 --> 00:44:37.342
Well…

00:44:39.441 --> 00:44:41.652
if I put an arrow through
Loki's eye socket…

00:44:41.735 --> 00:44:43.913
I would sleep better, I suppose.

00:44:47.115 --> 00:44:48.776
Now you sound like you.

00:44:49.284 --> 00:44:50.774
But you don't.

00:44:52.954 --> 00:44:54.010
You're a spy…

00:44:54.093 --> 00:44:55.699
not a soldier.

00:44:55.915 --> 00:44:57.198
Now you want to…

00:44:57.494 --> 00:44:59.205
wade into a war.

00:44:59.288 --> 00:45:00.288
Why?

00:45:02.344 --> 00:45:03.903
What did Loki do to you?

00:45:05.133 --> 00:45:06.875
He didn't.
I just…

00:45:11.306 --> 00:45:12.606
Natasha.

00:45:14.871 --> 00:45:16.740
I've been compromised.

00:45:19.981 --> 00:45:21.780
I got red in my ledger.

00:45:24.094 --> 00:45:25.907
I would like to wipe it out.

00:45:42.337 --> 00:45:43.666
Was he married?

00:45:43.934 --> 00:45:44.934
No.

00:45:45.507 --> 00:45:46.884
There was a…

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.726
cellist, I think.

00:45:51.259 --> 00:45:52.394
I'm sorry.

00:45:53.473 --> 00:45:55.108
He seemed like a good man.

00:45:56.392 --> 00:45:57.380
He was an idiot.

00:45:57.463 --> 00:45:59.649
Why?
For believing?

00:45:59.732 --> 00:46:01.283
For taking on Loki alone.

00:46:01.523 --> 00:46:03.183
He was doing his job.

00:46:03.358 --> 00:46:04.484
He was out of his league.

00:46:04.567 --> 00:46:05.990
He should have waited.

00:46:06.073 --> 00:46:07.112
He should have…

00:46:07.195 --> 00:46:08.822
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

00:46:08.905 --> 00:46:11.066
Right, I've heard that before.

00:46:11.199 --> 00:46:12.617
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.691
We are not soldiers.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.925
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

00:46:21.107 --> 00:46:22.046
Neither am I.

00:46:22.129 --> 00:46:24.463
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

00:46:24.546 --> 00:46:27.503
But right now, we got to put
that behind us and get this done.

00:46:28.148 --> 00:46:29.559
Loki needs a power source.

00:46:29.642 --> 00:46:31.636
- If we can put together a list…
- He made it personal.

00:46:31.719 --> 00:46:32.804
That's not the point.

00:46:32.887 --> 00:46:35.432
That is the point.
That's Loki's point.

00:46:35.515 --> 00:46:37.476
He hit us all right where we live.
Why?

00:46:37.559 --> 00:46:38.306
To tear us apart.

00:46:38.389 --> 00:46:39.880
Yeah, divide and conquer is…

00:46:40.233 --> 00:46:40.881
great but…

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:43.068
he knows he has to take us
out to win, right?

00:46:43.151 --> 00:46:44.807
That's what he wants.

00:46:44.899 --> 00:46:47.211
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

00:46:47.318 --> 00:46:48.703
He wants an audience.

00:46:49.404 --> 00:46:51.763
- Alright. I caught his act in Stuttgart.
- Yeah.

00:46:51.857 --> 00:46:54.723
That was just previews.
This is opening night and…

00:46:54.806 --> 00:46:56.828
Loki he's a full-tilt diva, right?

00:46:56.911 --> 00:46:58.497
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.868
He wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered…

00:47:04.127 --> 00:47:05.474
Son of a bitch.

00:47:16.817 --> 00:47:18.066
Time to go.

00:47:18.149 --> 00:47:19.818
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

00:47:19.901 --> 00:47:21.401
Can you fly one of those jets?

00:47:22.395 --> 00:47:23.696
I can.

00:47:27.197 --> 00:47:28.401
You got a suit?

00:47:28.484 --> 00:47:29.694
Yeah.

00:47:29.777 --> 00:47:31.117
Then suit up.

00:47:58.883 --> 00:48:00.495
Hey, you guys aren't authorized
to be in here.

00:48:00.578 --> 00:48:02.778
Son, just don't.

00:48:04.812 --> 00:48:05.772
Sir.

00:48:05.855 --> 00:48:07.156
Agent Hill.

00:48:07.607 --> 00:48:09.392
Those cards…

00:48:11.319 --> 00:48:13.499
they were in Coulson's locker…

00:48:13.582 --> 00:48:15.086
not in his jacket.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.707
They needed the push.

00:48:24.832 --> 00:48:27.572
<i>We have an unauthorized
departure from Bay 6.</i>

00:48:27.752 --> 00:48:29.223
They found him.

00:48:30.171 --> 00:48:32.915
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

00:48:34.008 --> 00:48:36.139
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.

00:48:49.857 --> 00:48:51.909
<i>Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor…</i>

00:48:52.548 --> 00:48:55.338
<i>but the device is already self-sustaining.</i>

00:48:55.655 --> 00:48:57.560
<i>Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.</i>

00:48:58.531 --> 00:49:00.012
It's too late!

00:49:01.865 --> 00:49:03.480
She can't stop now.

00:49:04.372 --> 00:49:06.415
She wants to show us something!

00:49:07.059 --> 00:49:08.656
A new universe.

00:49:09.085 --> 00:49:10.278
<i>Ok.</i>

00:49:17.677 --> 00:49:19.626
<i>The barrier is pure energy.</i>

00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:21.598
<i>It's unbreachable.</i>

00:49:21.681 --> 00:49:23.010
<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>

00:49:24.392 --> 00:49:25.735
<i>Plan B.</i>

00:49:26.853 --> 00:49:28.938
<i>Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready
for deployment.</i>

00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:31.207
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

00:49:51.085 --> 00:49:53.990
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

00:49:55.089 --> 00:49:57.131
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.219
You should have left
your armor on for that.

00:49:59.302 --> 00:50:00.487
Yeah.

00:50:00.845 --> 00:50:03.110
It's seen a bit of mileage,
and you've got the…

00:50:03.261 --> 00:50:05.016
glow stick of destiny.

00:50:05.475 --> 00:50:06.885
Would you like a drink?

00:50:07.782 --> 00:50:09.062
Stalling me won't change anything.

00:50:09.145 --> 00:50:10.656
No, no, no. Threatening.

00:50:11.439 --> 00:50:12.823
No drink, are you sure?

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.345
I'm having one.

00:50:15.485 --> 00:50:17.028
The Chitauri are coming.

00:50:17.689 --> 00:50:19.426
Nothing will change that.

00:50:20.281 --> 00:50:21.741
What have I to fear?

00:50:21.824 --> 00:50:23.014
The Avengers.

00:50:25.518 --> 00:50:27.998
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

00:50:28.081 --> 00:50:29.749
Earth's mightiest heroes, type thing.

00:50:29.832 --> 00:50:31.582
Yes, I've met them.

00:50:31.665 --> 00:50:32.904
Yeah.

00:50:33.002 --> 00:50:35.286
It takes us a while to get any traction,
I'll give you that one.

00:50:35.369 --> 00:50:37.489
But let's do a head count, here.

00:50:37.694 --> 00:50:39.992
Your brother, the demigod…

00:50:41.969 --> 00:50:45.690
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

00:50:45.801 --> 00:50:48.893
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues…

00:50:48.976 --> 00:50:51.163
a couple of master assassins and you…

00:50:51.246 --> 00:50:52.404
big fella…

00:50:52.816 --> 00:50:55.605
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

00:50:55.722 --> 00:50:56.918
That was the plan.

00:50:57.001 --> 00:50:58.434
Not a great plan.

00:50:58.918 --> 00:51:00.400
When they come…

00:51:01.197 --> 00:51:02.586
and they will…

00:51:02.782 --> 00:51:04.030
they'll come for you.

00:51:04.182 --> 00:51:05.112
I have an army.

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:06.579
We have a Hulk.

00:51:06.953 --> 00:51:08.352
I thought the beast had wandered off.

00:51:08.435 --> 00:51:10.415
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

00:51:10.498 --> 00:51:13.927
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

00:51:14.567 --> 00:51:18.638
Maybe your army comes and maybe
it's too much for us, but it's all on you.

00:51:19.882 --> 00:51:21.251
Because if we can't protect the Earth…

00:51:21.334 --> 00:51:23.195
you can be damn
well sure we'll avenge it.

00:51:26.347 --> 00:51:28.379
How will your friends have time for me…

00:51:29.475 --> 00:51:31.490
when they are so busy fighting you?

00:51:38.869 --> 00:51:39.569
This usually works.

00:51:39.652 --> 00:51:41.563
Well performance issues it's…

00:51:41.784 --> 00:51:43.886
not uncommon.
One out of five…

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.692
Jarvis, anytime now.

00:51:50.872 --> 00:51:53.666
You will all fall before me.

00:51:53.749 --> 00:51:55.037
Deploy!

00:51:55.251 --> 00:51:56.491
Deploy!

00:52:23.712 --> 00:52:26.564
<i>And there is one other person
you pissed off.</i>

00:52:27.742 --> 00:52:29.472
<i>His name was Phil.</i>

00:52:52.975 --> 00:52:53.995
Right.

00:52:54.602 --> 00:52:55.756
Army.

00:54:08.092 --> 00:54:09.155
Loki!

00:54:09.544 --> 00:54:11.436
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

00:54:11.519 --> 00:54:12.609
You can't.

00:54:12.692 --> 00:54:14.515
There is no stopping it.

00:54:14.872 --> 00:54:16.309
There is only…

00:54:16.693 --> 00:54:17.834
the war.

00:54:17.917 --> 00:54:19.301
So be it.

00:54:41.542 --> 00:54:43.297
<i>Stark, we're on your three,
headed northeast.</i>

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.982
What did you stop for drive-through?

00:54:45.129 --> 00:54:47.349
Swing up Park.
I'm going to lay them out for you.

00:55:05.274 --> 00:55:06.740
<i>Sir, we have more incoming.</i>

00:55:06.823 --> 00:55:08.635
Fine.
Let's keep them occupied.

00:55:15.368 --> 00:55:17.211
Nat?
I see him.

00:56:01.538 --> 00:56:03.370
We got to get back up there.

00:56:55.176 --> 00:56:56.894
Stark, are you seeing this?

00:56:57.553 --> 00:56:59.931
<i>Seeing.
Still working on believing.</i>

00:57:00.014 --> 00:57:01.432
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

00:57:01.515 --> 00:57:02.600
Banner?

00:57:02.683 --> 00:57:03.984
Just keep me posted.

00:57:04.226 --> 00:57:06.390
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

00:57:09.023 --> 00:57:10.608
Look at this!

00:57:10.691 --> 00:57:12.392
Look around you!

00:57:13.027 --> 00:57:15.947
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

00:57:16.874 --> 00:57:18.390
It's too late.

00:57:20.034 --> 00:57:21.204
It's too late to stop it.

00:57:21.287 --> 00:57:24.871
No. We can, together.

00:57:31.879 --> 00:57:33.337
Sentiment.

00:58:01.867 --> 00:58:03.719
We've got civilians still trapped up here.

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.421
Loki.

00:58:17.716 --> 00:58:19.219
They're fish in a barrel down there.

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:26.986
We got this.
It's good. Go.

00:58:27.226 --> 00:58:28.735
Do you think you can hold them off?

00:58:28.819 --> 00:58:30.119
Captain…

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:33.447
it would be my genuine pleasure.

00:59:01.427 --> 00:59:03.487
Just like Budapest all over again.

00:59:03.762 --> 00:59:06.273
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

00:59:22.448 --> 00:59:23.368
It's going to be an hour…

00:59:23.451 --> 00:59:24.909
before they can
scramble the National Guard.

00:59:24.992 --> 00:59:26.527
National Guard?

00:59:27.703 --> 00:59:29.732
Does the army know
what's happening here?

00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:31.021
Do we?

00:59:31.665 --> 00:59:32.917
You need men in these buildings.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.833
There are people inside and they're going
to be running right into the line of fire.

00:59:35.916 --> 00:59:37.804
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

00:59:37.887 --> 00:59:39.632
You keep them off the streets.

00:59:39.715 --> 00:59:42.385
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

00:59:42.468 --> 00:59:44.448
Why the hell should
I take orders from you?

00:59:58.192 --> 00:59:59.363
I need men in those buildings.

00:59:59.446 --> 01:00:01.550
Lead the people down and away
from the streets.

01:00:01.695 --> 01:00:04.595
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

01:00:14.667 --> 01:00:16.456
Well, we got its attention.

01:00:16.539 --> 01:00:17.995
<i>What the hell was step two?</i>

01:00:47.783 --> 01:00:48.826
What's the story upstairs?

01:00:48.909 --> 01:00:50.870
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

01:00:50.953 --> 01:00:53.278
<i>Thor's right.
We got to deal with these guys.</i>

01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:55.202
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:57.206
I have unfinished business with Loki.

01:00:57.313 --> 01:00:59.428
- Yeah? Well, get in line.
- Save it.

01:00:59.545 --> 01:01:02.061
Loki's going to keep this fight focused
on us, and that's what we need.

01:01:02.144 --> 01:01:03.745
Without him, these things could run wild.

01:01:03.828 --> 01:01:05.105
We got Stark up top.

01:01:05.188 --> 01:01:06.601
He's going to need us to…

01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:15.381
So…

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:18.197
this all seems horrible.

01:01:18.436 --> 01:01:19.862
I've seen worse.

01:01:20.274 --> 01:01:21.150
Sorry.

01:01:21.233 --> 01:01:24.070
No, we could use a little worse.

01:01:24.153 --> 01:01:26.553
Stark, we got him.
Banner?

01:01:26.636 --> 01:01:28.032
Just like you said.

01:01:28.115 --> 01:01:29.634
Then tell him to suit up.

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:31.490
I'm bringing the party to you.

01:01:37.249 --> 01:01:39.558
I don't see how that's a party.

01:01:47.392 --> 01:01:48.693
Dr. Banner.

01:01:49.762 --> 01:01:52.142
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

01:01:52.565 --> 01:01:54.560
That's my secret, Cap.

01:01:56.643 --> 01:01:58.278
I'm always angry.

01:02:09.656 --> 01:02:11.164
<i>Hold on!</i>

01:02:41.188 --> 01:02:42.864
Send the rest.

01:02:49.321 --> 01:02:50.516
Guys.

01:02:50.864 --> 01:02:52.061
<i>Call it, Captain.</i>

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:53.451
Alright, listen up.

01:02:53.534 --> 01:02:56.084
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

01:02:56.411 --> 01:02:57.658
Barton, I want you on that roof.

01:02:57.741 --> 01:02:59.790
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

01:02:59.873 --> 01:03:01.248
Stark, you got the perimeter.

01:03:01.331 --> 01:03:02.805
Anything gets more
than three blocks out…

01:03:02.888 --> 01:03:04.240
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

01:03:04.323 --> 01:03:05.038
Can you give me a lift?

01:03:05.121 --> 01:03:07.174
<i>Right. Better clench up, Legolas.</i>

01:03:10.318 --> 01:03:12.926
Thor, you got to try
and bottleneck that portal.

01:03:13.009 --> 01:03:14.055
Slow them down.

01:03:14.138 --> 01:03:16.314
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

01:03:18.615 --> 01:03:20.113
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:21.372
We keep the fighting here.

01:03:21.719 --> 01:03:22.798
And Hulk…

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.566
Smash.

01:04:19.819 --> 01:04:20.987
Sir.

01:04:22.017 --> 01:04:23.318
The Council is on.

01:04:27.961 --> 01:04:28.976
Stark…

01:04:29.151 --> 01:04:31.307
you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail.

01:04:32.886 --> 01:04:35.136
I'm just trying
to keep them off the streets.

01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:37.127
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

01:04:37.262 --> 01:04:38.737
So find a tight corner.

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:40.538
I will roger that.

01:05:02.955 --> 01:05:04.604
Oh, boy.

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.748
Nice call.

01:05:13.131 --> 01:05:14.383
What else you got?

01:05:14.466 --> 01:05:17.102
<i>Thor is taking on
a squadron down on Sixth.</i>

01:05:17.386 --> 01:05:19.419
And he didn't invite me.

01:05:59.094 --> 01:06:00.872
Captain, none of this is going
to mean a damn thing…

01:06:00.955 --> 01:06:02.139
if we don't close that portal.

01:06:02.222 --> 01:06:03.766
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

01:06:03.849 --> 01:06:05.642
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

01:06:08.186 --> 01:06:10.390
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:12.610
I got a ride.

01:06:13.354 --> 01:06:14.967
I could use a boost, though.

01:06:17.145 --> 01:06:18.489
Are you sure about this?

01:06:18.572 --> 01:06:20.861
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

01:06:48.101 --> 01:06:50.066
Ok, turn, turn. Turn!

01:06:50.149 --> 01:06:52.076
Less! Less!

01:08:14.521 --> 01:08:17.407
<i>Captain, the bank on 42nd
past Madison.</i>

01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:19.395
<i>They've cornered
a lot of civilians in there.</i>

01:08:19.478 --> 01:08:20.708
I'm on it.

01:08:41.548 --> 01:08:42.977
Everyone! Clear out!

01:09:13.246 --> 01:09:14.685
<i>Director Fury…</i>

01:09:14.961 --> 01:09:16.521
<i>the Council has made a decision.</i>

01:09:16.604 --> 01:09:19.624
I recognize the Council
has made a decision.

01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:21.463
But given that it's a stupid-ass decision…

01:09:21.546 --> 01:09:22.925
I have elected to ignore it.

01:09:23.008 --> 01:09:26.176
<i>Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.</i>

01:09:26.259 --> 01:09:27.344
<i>You scramble that jet…</i>

01:09:27.427 --> 01:09:30.583
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

01:09:30.744 --> 01:09:32.586
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it…

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.726
I will not order a nuclear strike…

01:09:34.809 --> 01:09:36.311
against a civilian population.

01:09:36.394 --> 01:09:38.856
<i>If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.</i>

01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:41.202
If I send that bird out,
we already have.

01:09:45.445 --> 01:09:46.791
Oh, you.

01:09:49.407 --> 01:09:50.579
Hawkeye!

01:09:51.701 --> 01:09:53.268
Nat, what are you doing?

01:09:53.951 --> 01:09:55.252
A little help?

01:10:00.366 --> 01:10:01.667
I got him.

01:10:27.529 --> 01:10:28.830
Enough!

01:10:29.155 --> 01:10:31.566
You are, all of you, beneath me!

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.536
I am a god, you dull creature.

01:10:34.619 --> 01:10:36.462
And I will not be bullied by…

01:10:45.672 --> 01:10:47.691
Puny god.

01:10:55.932 --> 01:10:57.375
The scepter…

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.153
Doctor.

01:11:01.688 --> 01:11:03.116
Loki's scepter.

01:11:03.232 --> 01:11:04.566
The energy.

01:11:04.649 --> 01:11:06.318
The Tesseract can't fight…

01:11:06.401 --> 01:11:08.366
but you can't protect against yourself.

01:11:08.449 --> 01:11:09.446
It's not your fault.

01:11:09.529 --> 01:11:11.269
You didn't know what you were doing.

01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:15.724
Actually, I think I did.

01:11:16.328 --> 01:11:19.045
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

01:11:20.457 --> 01:11:21.959
Loki's scepter.

01:11:22.042 --> 01:11:24.387
It may be able to close the portal.

01:11:26.713 --> 01:11:28.599
And I'm looking right at it.

01:11:40.615 --> 01:11:44.001
<i>Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.</i>

01:11:51.321 --> 01:11:52.455
Jarvis…

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.758
you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

01:11:54.841 --> 01:11:57.310
<i>I wouldn't consider him
a role model.</i>

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:08.565
<i>Director Fury is
no longer in command.</i>

01:13:08.648 --> 01:13:10.734
<i>Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.</i>

01:13:10.817 --> 01:13:13.709
<i>7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff.</i>

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.622
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

01:13:16.865 --> 01:13:18.909
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

01:13:18.992 --> 01:13:20.327
We need to shut it down!

01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:22.804
Repeat, takeoff is not authorized.

01:13:53.193 --> 01:13:54.855
Stark, do you hear me?

01:13:55.487 --> 01:13:57.857
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

01:13:57.992 --> 01:13:59.156
<i>How long?</i>

01:13:59.657 --> 01:14:01.483
<i>Three minutes, max.</i>

01:14:01.868 --> 01:14:03.495
<i>The payload will wipe out Midtown.</i>

01:14:03.578 --> 01:14:05.614
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

01:14:05.697 --> 01:14:07.058
<i>I just did.</i>

01:14:20.178 --> 01:14:21.562
<i>Package is sent.</i>

01:14:21.645 --> 01:14:24.906
<i>Detonation in 2 minutes,
30 seconds, mark.</i>

01:14:47.664 --> 01:14:49.336
Are you ready for another bout?

01:14:50.643 --> 01:14:52.303
What, are you getting sleepy?

01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:58.933
Right at the crown!

01:15:05.098 --> 01:15:06.666
I can close it.

01:15:07.058 --> 01:15:08.573
Can anybody copy?

01:15:08.893 --> 01:15:10.598
I can shut the portal down.

01:15:10.681 --> 01:15:12.478
Do it!
<i>No, wait.</i>

01:15:12.561 --> 01:15:13.774
Stark, these things are still coming.

01:15:13.857 --> 01:15:14.907
I got a nuke coming in.

01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:16.683
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

01:15:26.796 --> 01:15:28.764
And I know just where to put it.

01:15:35.619 --> 01:15:38.131
<i>Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.</i>

01:15:38.214 --> 01:15:39.551
Save the rest for the turn, J.

01:15:39.634 --> 01:15:42.889
<i>Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?</i>

01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:45.422
Might as well.

01:15:47.932 --> 01:15:48.894
<i>The streets of New York City…</i>

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:50.352
<i>have become a battleground.</i>

01:15:50.435 --> 01:15:52.914
<i>The Army is here trying
to contain the violence…</i>

01:15:52.997 --> 01:15:54.668
<i>but clearly, it is outmatched.</i>

01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:57.055
<i>And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting…</i>

01:15:57.138 --> 01:15:59.926
<i>I have never seen anything like this.</i>

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.001
<i>We have limited
information on the team…</i>

01:16:02.084 --> 01:16:05.791
<i>but we do know that billionaire
Tony Stark's Iron Man…</i>

01:17:19.065 --> 01:17:20.785
Come on, Stark.

01:17:27.281 --> 01:17:28.749
Close it.

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.030
Son of a gun.

01:17:54.434 --> 01:17:56.159
He's not slowing down.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.713
Is he breathing?

01:18:43.483 --> 01:18:44.992
What the hell?

01:18:47.557 --> 01:18:48.904
What just happened?

01:18:49.663 --> 01:18:51.293
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

01:18:56.412 --> 01:18:57.611
We won.

01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:01.751
Alright, yay!

01:19:01.834 --> 01:19:03.775
Hurray. Good job, guys.

01:19:03.961 --> 01:19:05.348
Let's just not come in tomorrow.

01:19:05.431 --> 01:19:07.440
Let's just take a day.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.647
Have you ever tried shawarma?

01:19:10.087 --> 01:19:12.363
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

01:19:12.446 --> 01:19:14.431
I don't know what it is, but I want to try it.

01:19:14.514 --> 01:19:16.148
We're not finished yet.

01:19:20.937 --> 01:19:22.556
And then shawarma after.

01:19:44.710 --> 01:19:46.439
If it's all the same to you…

01:19:50.125 --> 01:19:51.881
I'll have that drink now.

01:19:59.851 --> 01:20:01.895
<i>Despite the devastation of
what has been confirmed…</i>

01:20:01.978 --> 01:20:03.690
<i>as an extraterrestrial attack…</i>

01:20:03.773 --> 01:20:05.303
<i>the extraordinary heroics…</i>

01:20:05.386 --> 01:20:07.265
<i>of the group known as the Avengers…</i>

01:20:07.348 --> 01:20:09.152
<i>has been to many a cause
not only for comfort…</i>

01:20:09.235 --> 01:20:10.278
<i>but for celebration.</i>

01:20:10.361 --> 01:20:12.244
<i>It's just really great knowing
they're out there.</i>

01:20:12.905 --> 01:20:14.783
<i>That someone is watching over us.</i>

01:20:14.866 --> 01:20:16.117
<i>I love you, Thor!</i>

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.952
<i>And then these guys were like…</i>

01:20:18.035 --> 01:20:19.370
<i>And then the air goes…</i>

01:20:19.453 --> 01:20:20.872
<i>And this green guy walks up
and he goes…</i>

01:20:20.955 --> 01:20:22.040
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:20:22.123 --> 01:20:24.667
<i>I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.</i>

01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:27.790
<i>It just seems that there is
a lot they're not telling us.</i>

01:20:27.873 --> 01:20:31.382
<i>Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.</i>

01:20:31.465 --> 01:20:33.426
<i>These so-called heroes…</i>

01:20:33.509 --> 01:20:36.993
<i>have to be held responsible
for the destruction done to this city.</i>

01:20:37.138 --> 01:20:39.472
<i>This was their fight.
Where are they now?</i>

01:20:39.555 --> 01:20:42.352
<i>Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.</i>

01:20:42.435 --> 01:20:45.021
<i>Their sudden appearance
and equally sudden disappearance…</i>

01:20:45.104 --> 01:20:47.645
<i>What, this is all somehow their fault?</i>

01:20:49.942 --> 01:20:52.698
<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>

01:20:55.239 --> 01:20:56.960
<i>Wherever he is…</i>

01:20:57.179 --> 01:21:00.155
<i>and wherever any of them are,
I would just…</i>

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.456
<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>

01:21:05.917 --> 01:21:07.436
<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>

01:21:07.519 --> 01:21:09.963
I'm not currently tracking
their whereabouts.

01:21:10.046 --> 01:21:12.187
I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.

01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:13.816
<i>And the Tesseract?</i>

01:21:14.050 --> 01:21:16.182
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

01:21:16.761 --> 01:21:18.863
Out of our reach.

01:21:19.214 --> 01:21:20.765
<i>That's not your call.</i>

01:21:20.848 --> 01:21:21.933
I didn't make it.

01:21:22.016 --> 01:21:24.310
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

01:21:24.393 --> 01:21:26.229
<i>So, you let him take it…</i>

01:21:26.312 --> 01:21:27.899
<i>and the war criminal, Loki…</i>

01:21:27.982 --> 01:21:29.717
<i>who should be
answering for his crime.</i>

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.435
Oh, I think he will be.

01:21:45.998 --> 01:21:48.668
<i>I don't think you understand
what you've started…</i>

01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:51.345
<i>letting the Avengers
loose on this world.</i>

01:21:51.462 --> 01:21:52.797
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.211
They surely are…

01:21:54.294 --> 01:21:56.685
and the whole world knows it.

01:21:57.093 --> 01:21:59.728
Every world knows it.

01:22:00.096 --> 01:22:02.187
<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>

01:22:02.348 --> 01:22:04.191
<i>A statement?</i>

01:22:06.769 --> 01:22:08.380
<i>A promise.</i>

01:22:16.838 --> 01:22:18.723
Sir, how does it work now?

01:22:19.615 --> 01:22:21.565
They've gone their separate ways.

01:22:21.648 --> 01:22:24.410
Some, pretty extremely far.

01:22:25.413 --> 01:22:28.834
If we get into a situation like this again,
what happens then?

01:22:29.064 --> 01:22:30.407
They'll come back.

01:22:31.627 --> 01:22:33.198
Are you really sure about that?

01:22:33.431 --> 01:22:34.732
I am.

01:22:36.004 --> 01:22:37.426
Why?

01:22:38.384 --> 01:22:40.461
Because we'll need them to.

01:23:35.913 --> 01:23:38.341
Humans.

01:23:39.667 --> 01:23:44.130
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

01:23:45.005 --> 01:23:47.074
They stand.

01:23:48.008 --> 01:23:49.887
They are unruly…

01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:53.523
and therefore cannot be ruled.

01:24:01.438 --> 01:24:04.144
To challenge them…

01:24:04.441 --> 01:24:08.120
is to court death.
