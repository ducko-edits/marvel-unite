00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.120
In case it's unclear,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.600
if you try to escape,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.000
if you so much as
scratch that glass,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.560
it's 30,000 feet straight
down in a steel trap.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.200
You get how that works?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.880
Ant, boot.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.960
It's an impressive cage.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.560
Not built, I think, for me.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.000
Built for something a
lot stronger than you.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.400
Oh, I've heard.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.560
<i>A mindless beast.</i>

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.240
<i>Makes play he's still a man.</i>

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.520
<i>How desperate are you,</i>

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.840
<i>that you call on such lost
creatures to defend you?</i>

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.360
<i>How desperate am I?</i>

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.400
You threaten my world with war.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.760
You steal a force you
can't hope to control.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.760
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.000
You have made me very desperate.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080
You might not be
glad that you did.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.720
Ooh.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.600
It burns you to
have come so close.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.760
To have the Tesseract,
to have power,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.760
unlimited power.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.960
And for what?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.440
A warm light for all
mankind to share.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.920
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.640
Well, let me know
if "real power"

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.280
wants a magazine or something.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.120
He really grows
on you, doesn't he?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.320
Loki's gonna drag this out.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.880
So, Thor, what's his play?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.640
He has an army
called the Chitauri.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.760
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.320
He means to lead them
against your people.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.080
They will win him the Earth,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.000
in return, I suspect,
for the Tesseract.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.960
An army

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.840
from outer space.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.480
So, he's building
another portal.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.000
That's what he
needs Erik Selvig for.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.080
Selvig?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.680
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.000
Loki has him under
some kind of spell,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.640
along with one of ours.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.440
I want to know why
Loki let us take him.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.840
He's not leading
an army from here.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.760
I don't think we should
be focusing on Loki.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.760
That guy's brain
is a bag full of cats.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.200
You could smell crazy on him.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.200
Have care how you speak.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.880
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.400
And he is my brother.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.520
He killed 80 people in two days.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.320
He's adopted.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.920
I think it's about
the mechanics.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.160
It's a stabilizing agent.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.640
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.320
I'll fly you to Portland.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.080
Keep love alive.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.200
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.200
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.680
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.120
Also, it means the
portal can open as wide

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.760
and stay open as
long, as Loki wants.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.680
Raise the mizzenmast.
Jib the topsails.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.600
That man is playing <i>Galaga.</i>

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.000
He thought we wouldn't
notice, but we did.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.400
How does Fury even see these?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.480
He turns.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.440
Sounds exhausting.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.720
The rest of the raw materials,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.680
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.280
The only major
component he still needs

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.000
is a power source of
high-energy density.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.440
Something to
kick-start the Cube.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.640
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800
Last night.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.560
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.760
Am I the only one
who did the reading?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.720
Does Loki need any
particular kind of power source?

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.640
He would have to heat the
Cube to 120-million Kelvin

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.320
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.760
Unless Selvig has
figured out how to stabilize

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.040
the quantum tunneling effect.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.240
Well, if he could do that,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.600
he could achieve
heavy ion fusion

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.880
at any reactor on the planet.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.520
Finally, someone
who speaks English.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.680
Is that what just happened?

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.960
It's good to meet
you, Dr. Banner.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.160
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.160
And I'm a huge fan of
the way you lose control

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.400
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.000
Thanks.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.720
Dr. Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.200
I was hoping you might join him.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.600
I would start with
that stick of his.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.680
It may be magical,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.160
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.320
I don't know about that, but
it is powered by the Cube.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.400
And I would like to
know how Loki used it

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.200
to turn two of the
sharpest men I know

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.120
into his personal
flying monkeys.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.240
Monkeys? I do not understand.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.120
I do.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.000
I understood that reference.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.280
Shall we play, Doctor?

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.200
This way, sir.

00:06:28.085 --> 00:06:29.685
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

00:06:29.845 --> 00:06:31.925
with Selvig's reports
of the Tesseract.

00:06:32.245 --> 00:06:33.925
But it's going to take
weeks to process.

00:06:34.085 --> 00:06:35.365
If we bypass their mainframe

00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:36.725
and direct route to
the Homer cluster

00:06:36.885 --> 00:06:40.005
we can clock this at
around 600 teraflops.

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.125
All I packed was a toothbrush.

00:06:44.165 --> 00:06:45.805
You know, you should come
by Stark Tower sometime.

00:06:45.965 --> 00:06:48.085
Top ten floors, all R&amp;D.

00:06:48.365 --> 00:06:49.845
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

00:06:50.005 --> 00:06:52.605
Thanks, but the last
time I was in New York,

00:06:52.765 --> 00:06:55.325
I kind of broke Harlem.

00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:57.365
Well, I promise a
stress-free environment.

00:06:57.525 --> 00:06:59.365
No tension, no surprises.

00:06:59.445 --> 00:07:00.725
Ow!

00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:02.365
- Hey!
- Nothing?

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:03.605
Are you nuts?

00:07:03.765 --> 00:07:04.725
Jury's out.

00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:06.045
You really have got a
lid on it, haven't you?

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:07.125
What's your secret?

00:07:07.205 --> 00:07:08.725
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

00:07:08.805 --> 00:07:09.965
Is everything a joke to you?

00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:11.285
Funny things are.

00:07:11.405 --> 00:07:13.205
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

00:07:13.285 --> 00:07:14.485
isn't funny.

00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:15.645
No offense, Doc.

00:07:15.805 --> 00:07:17.245
It's all right, I wouldn't
have come aboard

00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:20.205
if I couldn't handle
pointy things.

00:07:20.405 --> 00:07:22.925
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

00:07:23.085 --> 00:07:24.725
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr. Stark.

00:07:24.885 --> 00:07:26.325
Do you think I'm not?

00:07:26.485 --> 00:07:29.285
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

00:07:29.445 --> 00:07:31.125
What isn't he telling us?

00:07:31.205 --> 00:07:33.045
I can't do the equation
unless I have all the variables.

00:07:33.645 --> 00:07:34.965
You think Fury's
hiding something?

00:07:35.165 --> 00:07:38.165
He's a spy.
Captain, he's "the" spy.

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:40.085
His secrets have secrets.

00:07:40.245 --> 00:07:41.845
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:42.925
Uh...

00:07:43.925 --> 00:07:45.685
I just want to finish
my work here, and...

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:47.205
Doctor?

00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:55.085
"A warm light for all mankind."

00:07:55.165 --> 00:07:57.205
Loki's jab at Fury
about the Cube.

00:07:57.685 --> 00:07:58.805
I heard it.

00:07:58.965 --> 00:08:00.805
I think that was meant for you.

00:08:01.965 --> 00:08:04.845
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

00:08:05.005 --> 00:08:06.165
it was still all over the news.

00:08:06.365 --> 00:08:08.365
The Stark Tower?
That big, ugly

00:08:09.925 --> 00:08:10.965
building in New York?

00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:12.285
It's powered by an arc reactor,

00:08:12.365 --> 00:08:14.685
a self-sustaining energy source.

00:08:14.845 --> 00:08:17.285
That building will run
itself for, what, a year?

00:08:17.445 --> 00:08:19.205
It's just the prototype.

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:21.365
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

00:08:21.765 --> 00:08:23.165
That's what he's getting at.

00:08:23.325 --> 00:08:24.725
So, why didn't
S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in

00:08:24.845 --> 00:08:25.885
on the Tesseract project?

00:08:26.045 --> 00:08:27.805
What are they doing
in the energy business

00:08:27.885 --> 00:08:29.205
in the first place?

00:08:29.365 --> 00:08:31.005
I should probably look into that

00:08:31.165 --> 00:08:32.365
once my decryption program

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:34.645
finishes breaking into all
of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

00:08:34.725 --> 00:08:35.725
I'm sorry. Did you say...

00:08:35.885 --> 00:08:37.885
Jarvis has been running
it since I hit the bridge.

00:08:38.045 --> 00:08:39.645
In a few hours, I'll
know every dirty secret

00:08:39.725 --> 00:08:40.845
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever
tried to hide.

00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:41.925
Blueberry?

00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:43.885
Yet you're confused about
why they didn't want you around.

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:47.045
An intelligence organization
that fears intelligence?

00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:48.645
Historically, not awesome.

00:08:48.805 --> 00:08:51.045
I think Loki's
trying to wind us up.

00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:52.725
This is a man who
means to start a war,

00:08:52.885 --> 00:08:55.565
and if we don't stay
focused, he'll succeed.

00:08:55.725 --> 00:08:58.245
We have orders.
We should follow them.

00:08:58.725 --> 00:09:00.325
Following's not really my style.

00:09:01.925 --> 00:09:04.245
And you're all about
style, aren't you?

00:09:04.405 --> 00:09:05.405
Of the people in this room,

00:09:05.565 --> 00:09:07.245
which one is, A,
wearing a spangly outfit,

00:09:07.325 --> 00:09:08.725
and, B, not of use?

00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:13.085
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

00:09:16.085 --> 00:09:17.885
Just find the Cube.

00:09:29.725 --> 00:09:31.685
That's the guy my dad
never shut up about?

00:09:32.085 --> 00:09:33.125
I'm wondering if
they shouldn't have

00:09:33.245 --> 00:09:34.925
- kept him on ice.
- Huh.

00:09:35.725 --> 00:09:37.485
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

00:09:37.565 --> 00:09:39.285
He does have the jump on us.

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:42.205
What he's got is an
Acme dynamite kit.

00:09:42.285 --> 00:09:44.085
It's going to blow
up in his face.

00:09:44.245 --> 00:09:46.565
And I'm going to be
there when it does.

00:09:46.845 --> 00:09:49.045
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

00:09:50.405 --> 00:09:52.405
Uh-huh. Or you'll be
suiting up with the rest of us.

00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:57.645
You see, I don't
get a suit of armor.

00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:01.125
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:02.965
It's a nightmare.

00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:05.805
I've got a cluster of
shrapnel trying every second

00:10:05.965 --> 00:10:07.965
to crawl its way into my heart.

00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:10.125
This stops it.

00:10:10.325 --> 00:10:12.645
This little circle of
light, it's part of me now,

00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:15.525
not just armor.

00:10:16.165 --> 00:10:18.605
It's a terrible privilege.

00:10:18.965 --> 00:10:21.405
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

00:10:21.485 --> 00:10:22.485
It's different.

00:10:22.805 --> 00:10:26.085
Hey, I read all
about your accident.

00:10:26.245 --> 00:10:29.645
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

00:10:29.845 --> 00:10:32.325
So you're saying
that the Hulk...

00:10:33.685 --> 00:10:36.005
The other guy saved my life?

00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:37.685
That's nice.

00:10:38.485 --> 00:10:42.325
It's a nice sentiment.
Saved it for what?

00:10:43.605 --> 00:10:45.565
I guess we'll find out.

00:10:47.205 --> 00:10:48.845
You may not enjoy that.

00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:51.005
And you just might.

00:11:50.245 --> 00:11:51.605
<i>As soon as Loki took the doctor,</i>

00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:53.405
we moved Jane Foster.

00:11:53.565 --> 00:11:55.925
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromso.

00:11:56.085 --> 00:11:59.605
She was asked to consult
there very suddenly yesterday.

00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:03.605
Handsome fee, private
plane, very remote.

00:12:04.405 --> 00:12:05.445
She'll be safe.

00:12:05.605 --> 00:12:06.965
Thank you.

00:12:08.765 --> 00:12:10.765
It's no accident, Loki
taking Erik Selvig.

00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:14.325
I dread what he plans
for him once he's done.

00:12:14.485 --> 00:12:15.605
Erik is a good man.

00:12:15.765 --> 00:12:16.765
He talks about you a lot.

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:20.645
You changed his life.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:24.165
You changed everything
around here.

00:12:24.325 --> 00:12:26.485
They were better as they were.

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:29.125
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced,

00:12:29.285 --> 00:12:32.965
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:34.925
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

00:12:35.085 --> 00:12:38.125
You know, huge,
scaly, big antlers.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.645
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

00:12:40.805 --> 00:12:42.765
Well, they are repulsive.

00:12:44.005 --> 00:12:46.285
And they trample
everything in their path.

00:12:53.965 --> 00:12:55.885
When I first came to Earth,

00:12:55.965 --> 00:12:57.405
Loki's rage followed me here,

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.325
and your people paid the price.

00:12:59.805 --> 00:13:01.645
And now, again.

00:13:04.205 --> 00:13:06.685
In my youth, I courted war.

00:13:08.445 --> 00:13:10.485
War hasn't started yet.

00:13:11.685 --> 00:13:13.365
You think you could
make Loki tell us

00:13:13.485 --> 00:13:14.685
where the Tesseract is?

00:13:14.885 --> 00:13:18.125
I do not know.
Loki's mind is far afield.

00:13:18.285 --> 00:13:22.965
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:25.285
There's no pain would
prise his need from him.

00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:28.525
A lot of guys think that,

00:13:28.685 --> 00:13:30.165
until the pain starts.

00:13:32.485 --> 00:13:33.885
What are you asking me to do?

00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:37.645
I'm asking, what are
you prepared to do?

00:13:37.805 --> 00:13:38.845
Loki is a prisoner.

00:13:38.965 --> 00:13:39.925
Then why do I feel like

00:13:40.005 --> 00:13:41.325
he's the only
person on this boat

00:13:41.405 --> 00:13:43.005
that wants to be here?

00:13:55.565 --> 00:13:58.645
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

00:13:58.845 --> 00:14:00.525
But you figured I'd come.

00:14:01.165 --> 00:14:02.765
After.

00:14:03.605 --> 00:14:07.005
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

00:14:07.165 --> 00:14:10.885
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

00:14:11.765 --> 00:14:13.525
And I would cooperate.

00:14:13.685 --> 00:14:15.605
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

00:14:15.885 --> 00:14:17.725
I would say I've
expanded his mind.

00:14:20.285 --> 00:14:22.245
And once you've won,

00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:25.565
once you're king
of the mountain,

00:14:26.485 --> 00:14:29.045
what happens to his mind?

00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:30.125
Oh...

00:14:30.405 --> 00:14:32.125
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

00:14:32.365 --> 00:14:35.085
Love is for children.
I owe him a debt.

00:14:38.925 --> 00:14:40.285
Tell me.

00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:48.405
Before I worked for
S.H.I.E.L.D., I, uh...

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:54.645
Well, I made a name for myself.

00:14:54.805 --> 00:14:57.765
I have a very
specific skill set.

00:14:57.925 --> 00:15:01.605
I didn't care who
I used it for, or on.

00:15:02.605 --> 00:15:06.165
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
radar in a bad way.

00:15:07.285 --> 00:15:10.285
Agent Barton
was sent to kill me.

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:12.805
He made a different call.

00:15:14.765 --> 00:15:17.765
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

00:15:18.165 --> 00:15:19.445
Not let you out.

00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:21.565
No, but I like this.

00:15:22.445 --> 00:15:25.805
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:28.005
Regimes fall every day.

00:15:28.165 --> 00:15:30.685
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

00:15:30.845 --> 00:15:31.845
Or I was.

00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:34.805
And what are you now?

00:15:35.245 --> 00:15:38.165
It's really not
that complicated.

00:15:38.325 --> 00:15:42.485
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

00:15:43.445 --> 00:15:44.965
Can you?

00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:50.165
Can you wipe out that much red?

00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:53.125
Dreykov's daughter,

00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:56.365
Sao Paulo,

00:15:57.365 --> 00:15:59.605
the hospital fire?

00:16:00.685 --> 00:16:03.005
Barton told me everything.

00:16:03.165 --> 00:16:06.285
Your ledger is dripping.
It's gushing red,

00:16:06.445 --> 00:16:07.565
and you think saving a man

00:16:07.685 --> 00:16:08.965
no more virtuous than yourself

00:16:09.045 --> 00:16:10.325
will change anything?

00:16:10.485 --> 00:16:13.165
This is the basest
sentimentality.

00:16:13.325 --> 00:16:15.525
This is a child at prayer.

00:16:15.685 --> 00:16:17.045
Pathetic!

00:16:17.805 --> 00:16:20.325
<i>You lie and kill</i>

00:16:20.525 --> 00:16:23.525
<i>in the service of
liars and killers.</i>

00:16:26.645 --> 00:16:29.885
<i>You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,</i>

00:16:30.165 --> 00:16:32.845
<i>something that makes
up for the horrors.</i>

00:16:33.805 --> 00:16:36.045
<i>But they are part of you.</i>

00:16:36.365 --> 00:16:39.685
<i>And they will never go away.</i>

00:16:40.885 --> 00:16:44.205
I won't touch Barton, not
until I make him kill you.

00:16:44.365 --> 00:16:46.525
Slowly, intimately,

00:16:46.725 --> 00:16:49.085
in every way he knows you fear.

00:16:49.245 --> 00:16:52.365
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work,

00:16:52.565 --> 00:16:55.885
and when he screams,
I'll split his skull.

00:16:56.045 --> 00:16:59.125
This is my bargain,
you mewling quim.

00:17:00.725 --> 00:17:02.405
You're a monster.

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.045
Oh, no.

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:08.565
You brought the monster.

00:17:11.525 --> 00:17:13.205
So, Banner.

00:17:14.205 --> 00:17:15.445
That's your play.

00:17:15.565 --> 00:17:16.565
What?

00:17:17.525 --> 00:17:19.205
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

00:17:19.285 --> 00:17:20.805
Keep Banner in the lab.
I'm on my way.

00:17:20.885 --> 00:17:22.005
Send Thor as well.

00:17:23.605 --> 00:17:24.965
Thank you

00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:27.245
for your cooperation.

00:17:34.765 --> 00:17:36.165
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

00:17:36.245 --> 00:17:38.765
Uh, kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

00:17:39.445 --> 00:17:40.845
You're supposed to be
locating the Tesseract.

00:17:40.925 --> 00:17:42.525
We are. The model's locked

00:17:42.605 --> 00:17:43.925
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:45.005
When we get a hit,

00:17:45.085 --> 00:17:47.205
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

00:17:47.405 --> 00:17:51.445
Yeah, then you get your Cube back.
No muss, no fuss.

00:17:51.605 --> 00:17:52.805
What is "Phase 2"?

00:17:54.965 --> 00:17:57.765
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D.
uses the Cube to make weapons.

00:17:57.925 --> 00:17:59.765
Sorry, computer was
moving a little slow for me.

00:18:00.285 --> 00:18:02.525
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

00:18:02.605 --> 00:18:04.205
This does not mean
that we're making...

00:18:04.285 --> 00:18:05.325
I'm sorry, Nick.

00:18:05.405 --> 00:18:07.765
What were you lying?

00:18:07.845 --> 00:18:09.045
I was wrong, Director.

00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:10.325
The world hasn't changed a bit.

00:18:10.405 --> 00:18:11.445
Did you know about this?

00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:12.925
You want to think
about removing yourself

00:18:13.005 --> 00:18:14.365
from this environment, Doctor?

00:18:14.445 --> 00:18:16.725
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.005
Loki is manipulating you.

00:18:18.085 --> 00:18:19.725
And you've been
doing what, exactly?

00:18:19.805 --> 00:18:21.525
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:22.725
Yes, and I'm not leaving

00:18:22.805 --> 00:18:24.165
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

00:18:24.245 --> 00:18:25.885
I'd like to know
why S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:18:25.965 --> 00:18:27.165
is using the Tesseract

00:18:27.365 --> 00:18:29.765
to build weapons
of mass destruction.

00:18:30.325 --> 00:18:31.485
Because of him.

00:18:32.685 --> 00:18:33.685
Me?

00:18:34.685 --> 00:18:37.045
Last year, Earth had a
visitor from another planet

00:18:37.205 --> 00:18:40.325
who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town.

00:18:40.485 --> 00:18:42.685
We learned that not
only are we not alone,

00:18:42.885 --> 00:18:46.365
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

00:18:46.445 --> 00:18:48.725
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

00:18:48.925 --> 00:18:50.845
But you're not the only
people out there, are you?

00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:53.085
And you're not the only threat.

00:18:53.245 --> 00:18:56.325
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

00:18:56.925 --> 00:18:58.165
that can't be controlled.

00:18:58.325 --> 00:18:59.325
Like you controlled the Cube?

00:18:59.525 --> 00:19:00.805
Your work with the Tesseract

00:19:00.885 --> 00:19:03.525
is what drew Loki
to it, and his allies.

00:19:03.605 --> 00:19:05.045
It is a signal to all the realms

00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:07.805
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:09.005
A higher form?

00:19:09.085 --> 00:19:10.245
You forced our hand.

00:19:10.325 --> 00:19:11.285
We had to come
up with something.

00:19:11.365 --> 00:19:12.405
A nuclear deterrent.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.565
Because that always
calms everything right down.

00:19:14.645 --> 00:19:17.045
Remind me again how you
made your fortune, Stark.

00:19:17.165 --> 00:19:18.405
I'm sure if he still
made weapons,

00:19:18.485 --> 00:19:19.565
Stark would be neck-deep...

00:19:19.645 --> 00:19:21.285
Hold on.
How is this now about me?

00:19:21.365 --> 00:19:22.525
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

00:19:22.605 --> 00:19:24.565
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

00:19:24.645 --> 00:19:27.565
Excuse me, did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up?

00:19:27.645 --> 00:19:29.525
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:31.125
Are you boys really that naive?

00:19:31.205 --> 00:19:33.125
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors
potential threats.

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:34.565
Captain America's
on threat watch?

00:19:34.645 --> 00:19:35.605
We all are.

00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:37.245
Wait, you're on that list?

00:19:37.325 --> 00:19:38.925
Are you above or
below angry bees?

00:19:39.005 --> 00:19:40.005
Stark, so help me God,

00:19:40.085 --> 00:19:41.125
if you make one
more wisecrack...

00:19:41.205 --> 00:19:42.485
Threat! Verbal threat.
I feel threatened.

00:19:42.605 --> 00:19:44.565
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?

00:19:52.445 --> 00:19:54.085
<i>Transport Six-Six-Bravo,</i>

00:19:54.165 --> 00:19:55.445
<i>please relay confirm codes.</i>

00:19:55.525 --> 00:19:57.685
<i>I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.</i>

00:19:57.765 --> 00:19:59.885
<i>What is your haul? Over.</i>

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:02.565
<i>Arms and ammunition. Over.</i>

00:20:11.005 --> 00:20:13.125
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

00:20:13.285 --> 00:20:15.045
That's his M.O., isn't it?

00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:16.405
I mean, what are we, a team?

00:20:16.485 --> 00:20:19.485
No, we're a chemical
mixture that makes chaos.

00:20:19.605 --> 00:20:21.525
We're a time bomb.

00:20:21.685 --> 00:20:23.445
You need to step away.

00:20:23.645 --> 00:20:25.045
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

00:20:25.605 --> 00:20:27.685
You know damn well why.
Back off!

00:20:27.845 --> 00:20:30.005
I'm starting to want
you to make me.

00:20:30.165 --> 00:20:33.805
Yeah.
Big man in a suit of armor.

00:20:33.965 --> 00:20:35.485
Take that off, what are you?

00:20:35.645 --> 00:20:37.925
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

00:20:38.765 --> 00:20:41.845
I know guys with none
of that worth ten of you.

00:20:42.005 --> 00:20:43.125
I've seen the footage.

00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:45.485
The only thing you
really fight for is yourself.

00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:48.765
You're not the guy to
make the sacrifice play,

00:20:48.965 --> 00:20:51.445
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

00:20:51.605 --> 00:20:53.765
I think I would
just cut the wire.

00:20:56.805 --> 00:20:58.485
Always a way out.

00:20:58.645 --> 00:20:59.845
You may not be a threat,

00:21:00.005 --> 00:21:01.965
but you better stop
pretending to be a hero.

00:21:02.165 --> 00:21:04.485
A hero? Like you?

00:21:04.645 --> 00:21:06.645
You're a laboratory
experiment, Rogers.

00:21:06.805 --> 00:21:10.485
Everything special about
you came out of a bottle.

00:21:35.685 --> 00:21:37.805
Put on the suit.
Let's go a few rounds.

00:21:39.525 --> 00:21:43.085
You people are
so petty, and tiny.

00:21:43.165 --> 00:21:44.205
Yeah, this is a team.

00:21:44.285 --> 00:21:45.605
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

00:21:45.685 --> 00:21:46.805
Dr. Banner back to his...

00:21:46.885 --> 00:21:48.605
Where? You rented my room.

00:21:48.685 --> 00:21:50.525
The cell was just in case...

00:21:50.605 --> 00:21:51.845
In case you needed to kill me.

00:21:51.925 --> 00:21:54.845
But you can't. I know, I tried.

00:21:57.565 --> 00:22:00.525
I got low. I didn't see an end.

00:22:00.605 --> 00:22:02.165
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,

00:22:02.245 --> 00:22:05.165
and the other guy spit it out.

00:22:05.685 --> 00:22:06.845
So I moved on.

00:22:07.045 --> 00:22:09.765
I focused on helping other people.
I was good.

00:22:09.925 --> 00:22:12.165
Until you dragged me
back into this freak show

00:22:12.245 --> 00:22:13.725
and put everyone here at risk.

00:22:13.845 --> 00:22:15.965
You want to know my
secret, Agent Romanoff?

00:22:16.045 --> 00:22:17.885
You want to know
how I stay calm?

00:22:20.645 --> 00:22:22.885
Dr. Banner,

00:22:23.605 --> 00:22:24.965
put down the scepter.

00:22:33.725 --> 00:22:34.885
Got it.

00:22:35.725 --> 00:22:36.725
Sorry, kids,

00:22:36.805 --> 00:22:38.645
you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

00:22:38.725 --> 00:22:39.765
You located the Tesseract?

00:22:39.845 --> 00:22:40.805
I could get there fastest.

00:22:40.885 --> 00:22:42.045
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.

00:22:42.165 --> 00:22:43.125
No human is a match for it.

00:22:43.245 --> 00:22:44.605
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?

00:22:44.685 --> 00:22:45.645
Put on the suit, let's find out.

00:22:45.725 --> 00:22:47.165
I'm not afraid to
hit an old man.

00:22:47.245 --> 00:22:48.205
Put on the suit.

00:22:51.085 --> 00:22:52.725
Oh, my God.

00:23:08.245 --> 00:23:09.245
Put on the suit.

00:23:09.325 --> 00:23:10.685
Yeah.

00:23:13.445 --> 00:23:15.205
<i>All hands to stations.</i>

00:23:19.285 --> 00:23:21.045
- Hill!
<i>- External detonation.</i>

00:23:21.205 --> 00:23:22.525
Number three engine is down.

00:23:22.605 --> 00:23:23.605
We've been hit.

00:23:23.685 --> 00:23:24.885
- Can they get it running?
- Fire in engine three!

00:23:24.965 --> 00:23:26.005
Talk to me.

00:23:26.085 --> 00:23:27.805
Turbine looks mostly intact,

00:23:27.885 --> 00:23:29.805
but it's impossible to get
out there to make repairs

00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:31.365
while we're in the air.

00:23:31.445 --> 00:23:34.045
If we lose one more
engine, we won't be.

00:23:34.125 --> 00:23:36.165
Somebody's got to get
outside and patch that engine.

00:23:36.245 --> 00:23:38.005
- Stark, you copy that?
<i>- I'm on it.</i>

00:23:38.085 --> 00:23:40.125
<i>Coulson, initiate
defensive lockdown</i>

00:23:40.205 --> 00:23:41.365
<i>in the detention section,</i>

00:23:41.445 --> 00:23:42.525
<i>then get to the armory.</i>

00:23:42.605 --> 00:23:43.805
Romanoff?

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:48.845
We're okay.

00:23:51.365 --> 00:23:52.685
We're okay, right?

00:24:05.285 --> 00:24:06.525
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.

00:24:06.605 --> 00:24:08.445
Detention, wait for
cameras to go dark.

00:24:08.605 --> 00:24:09.845
- Got it.
- Stay close.

00:24:12.005 --> 00:24:13.445
Let's go, Level 4.

00:24:14.365 --> 00:24:16.525
Engine three.
I'll meet you there.

00:24:25.365 --> 00:24:26.645
Doctor?

00:24:28.925 --> 00:24:29.925
Bruce?

00:24:30.205 --> 00:24:33.965
You got to fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.

00:24:35.245 --> 00:24:36.405
We're going to be okay.
Listen to me.

00:24:36.485 --> 00:24:37.485
Are you hurt?

00:24:40.925 --> 00:24:43.005
We're going to be okay.
All right?

00:24:43.165 --> 00:24:45.805
I swear on my life,
I will get you out of this.

00:24:45.965 --> 00:24:47.325
You will walk away
and never ever...

00:24:47.485 --> 00:24:49.565
Your life?

00:25:06.085 --> 00:25:07.085
Bruce.

00:25:43.925 --> 00:25:47.165
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:49.165
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.

00:25:49.245 --> 00:25:51.245
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

00:25:51.325 --> 00:25:53.125
Is the sun coming up?

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:56.085
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.

00:25:56.165 --> 00:25:57.885
Get us over water.

00:25:57.965 --> 00:26:00.085
One more turbine
goes down, and we drop.

00:26:01.725 --> 00:26:02.725
Thanks.

00:26:06.925 --> 00:26:08.125
Stark!

00:26:10.805 --> 00:26:12.525
Stark, I'm here!

00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:14.165
<i>Good.</i>

00:26:15.325 --> 00:26:17.365
Let's see what we've got.

00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:19.205
I got to get this
superconducting coolant system

00:26:19.285 --> 00:26:20.285
back online

00:26:20.365 --> 00:26:21.845
before I can access the rotors,

00:26:21.965 --> 00:26:23.845
work on dislodging the debris.

00:26:26.325 --> 00:26:27.925
I need you to get to
that engine control panel

00:26:28.005 --> 00:26:31.725
and tell me which relays
are in overload position.

00:26:43.965 --> 00:26:45.565
<i>What does it look like in there?</i>

00:26:46.245 --> 00:26:48.805
It seems to run on
some form of electricity.

00:26:48.885 --> 00:26:50.685
Well, you're not wrong.

00:27:54.485 --> 00:27:57.325
We are not your enemies, Banner.

00:27:57.405 --> 00:27:59.525
Try to think!

00:28:08.565 --> 00:28:10.485
<i>Okay, the relays are intact.</i>

00:28:10.565 --> 00:28:12.045
What's our next move?

00:28:12.125 --> 00:28:13.125
Even if I clear the rotors,

00:28:13.205 --> 00:28:15.565
this thing won't
re-engage without a jump.

00:28:15.645 --> 00:28:17.005
I'm going to have to
get in there and push.

00:28:17.125 --> 00:28:18.925
If that thing gets up to
speed, you'll get shredded.

00:28:19.005 --> 00:28:21.045
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:22.565
long enough to disengage
maglev and that could...

00:28:22.645 --> 00:28:24.085
Speak English!

00:28:25.365 --> 00:28:26.525
You see that red lever?

00:28:27.725 --> 00:28:29.965
<i>It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.</i>

00:28:30.045 --> 00:28:31.885
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

00:29:24.405 --> 00:29:26.205
We need full evac on
the lower hangar bay.

00:29:29.485 --> 00:29:30.485
Grenade!

00:29:45.565 --> 00:29:46.965
<i>We've got a perimeter breach!</i>

00:29:47.045 --> 00:29:49.125
<i>Hostiles are in
S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.</i>

00:29:49.205 --> 00:29:51.325
<i>Call-outs at every junction.</i>

00:29:58.565 --> 00:30:00.845
<i>We have the Hulk and
Thor on Research Level 4.</i>

00:30:00.925 --> 00:30:02.525
<i>Levels 2 and 3 are dark.</i>

00:30:02.645 --> 00:30:04.805
Sir, the Hulk will
tear this place apart!

00:30:05.965 --> 00:30:06.965
Get his attention.

00:30:07.045 --> 00:30:11.245
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.

00:30:11.365 --> 00:30:12.725
<i>Don't get too close.</i>

00:30:12.805 --> 00:30:14.165
<i>Copy.</i>

00:30:26.085 --> 00:30:27.525
<i>Target acquired.</i>

00:30:31.765 --> 00:30:32.765
<i>Target engaged.</i>

00:30:44.365 --> 00:30:45.965
<i>Target angry, target angry!</i>

00:31:54.325 --> 00:31:56.605
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell...

00:32:14.965 --> 00:32:17.245
<i>Engine one is now in shut-down.</i>

00:32:25.645 --> 00:32:27.845
We are in an
uncontrolled descent.

00:32:27.925 --> 00:32:29.765
<i>Sir, we've lost all
power in engine one.</i>

00:32:30.405 --> 00:32:32.245
<i>It's Barton.
He took out our systems.</i>

00:32:32.325 --> 00:32:34.805
<i>He's headed for
the detention level.</i>

00:32:34.885 --> 00:32:36.885
<i>Does anybody copy?</i>

00:32:38.045 --> 00:32:40.165
This is Agent Romanoff.

00:32:40.325 --> 00:32:41.845
I copy.

00:32:46.365 --> 00:32:47.405
<i>Stark, we're losing altitude.</i>

00:32:47.485 --> 00:32:49.005
Yeah, I noticed.

00:33:18.085 --> 00:33:19.085
No!

00:33:26.645 --> 00:33:29.365
Are you ever not
going to fall for that?

00:34:12.325 --> 00:34:14.645
The humans think us immortal.

00:34:15.725 --> 00:34:17.245
Should we test that?

00:34:20.005 --> 00:34:21.245
Move away, please.

00:34:25.725 --> 00:34:27.285
You like this?

00:34:28.165 --> 00:34:29.525
We started working
on the prototype

00:34:29.605 --> 00:34:31.445
after you sent the Destroyer.

00:34:32.685 --> 00:34:34.925
Even I don't know what it does.

00:34:35.045 --> 00:34:36.965
Do you want to find out?

00:34:38.965 --> 00:34:40.445
No!

00:35:49.885 --> 00:35:51.365
Natasha?

00:36:22.885 --> 00:36:24.725
You're going to lose.

00:36:26.725 --> 00:36:27.925
Am I?

00:36:29.205 --> 00:36:31.725
It's in your nature. Hmm.

00:36:33.885 --> 00:36:36.165
Your heroes are scattered.

00:36:36.365 --> 00:36:40.005
Your floating fortress
falls from the sky.

00:36:40.205 --> 00:36:41.805
Where is my disadvantage?

00:36:42.445 --> 00:36:44.565
You lack conviction.

00:36:45.405 --> 00:36:46.405
I don't think I'm...

00:36:53.245 --> 00:36:54.965
So, that's what it does.

00:36:57.085 --> 00:36:59.805
<i>All hands to crash
stations immediately.</i>

00:37:27.765 --> 00:37:28.765
Cap, hit the lever.

00:37:29.125 --> 00:37:31.365
I need a minute here!

00:37:31.845 --> 00:37:32.925
Lever,

00:37:33.085 --> 00:37:34.245
now!

00:37:43.925 --> 00:37:44.925
Uh-oh.

00:37:46.125 --> 00:37:47.125
Help!

00:38:22.885 --> 00:38:24.205
Sorry, boss.

00:38:24.365 --> 00:38:26.165
The god rabbited.

00:38:26.325 --> 00:38:27.685
Just stay awake.

00:38:27.845 --> 00:38:29.365
Eyes on me.

00:38:29.565 --> 00:38:31.045
No, I'm clocking out here.

00:38:31.205 --> 00:38:32.725
Not an option.

00:38:33.725 --> 00:38:35.725
It's okay, boss.

00:38:37.645 --> 00:38:39.645
This was never gonna work

00:38:39.725 --> 00:38:41.565
if they didn't have something

00:38:42.405 --> 00:38:44.005
to...

00:39:13.045 --> 00:39:14.845
<i>Agent Coulson is down.</i>

00:39:16.245 --> 00:39:18.005
<i>A medical team is on
its way to your location.</i>

00:39:18.085 --> 00:39:19.525
<i>They're here.</i>

00:39:22.765 --> 00:39:24.445
<i>They called it.</i>

00:39:40.925 --> 00:39:42.565
These were in Phil
Coulson's jacket.

00:39:45.845 --> 00:39:48.005
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

00:39:51.445 --> 00:39:53.085
We're dead in the air up here.

00:39:53.245 --> 00:39:56.325
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

00:39:56.685 --> 00:39:59.125
Banner, Thor...

00:40:00.165 --> 00:40:02.085
I got nothing for you.

00:40:02.285 --> 00:40:05.205
I lost my one good eye.

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:10.325
Maybe I had that coming.

00:40:15.445 --> 00:40:16.765
Yes,

00:40:17.845 --> 00:40:22.205
we were going to build an
arsenal with the Tesseract.

00:40:22.645 --> 00:40:24.645
I never put all my chips
on that number, though,

00:40:24.805 --> 00:40:27.885
because I was playing
something even riskier.

00:40:31.725 --> 00:40:35.885
There was an idea,
Stark knows this,

00:40:37.725 --> 00:40:41.125
called the Avengers Initiative.

00:40:42.325 --> 00:40:44.445
The idea was to
bring together a group

00:40:44.525 --> 00:40:47.125
of remarkable people,

00:40:47.845 --> 00:40:50.485
to see if they could
become something more.

00:40:52.085 --> 00:40:53.685
To see if they
could work together

00:40:53.805 --> 00:40:55.925
when we needed them to,

00:40:56.325 --> 00:40:59.685
to fight the battles
that we never could.

00:41:02.485 --> 00:41:07.325
Phil Coulson died still
believing in that idea.

00:41:09.685 --> 00:41:11.325
In heroes.

00:41:19.365 --> 00:41:21.005
Well,

00:41:21.845 --> 00:41:24.525
it's an old-fashioned notion.

00:41:44.845 --> 00:41:47.365
<i>You fell out of the sky.</i>

00:42:01.365 --> 00:42:02.885
Did I hurt anybody?

00:42:03.045 --> 00:42:06.005
There's nobody
around here to get hurt.

00:42:06.165 --> 00:42:09.245
You did scare the hell out
of some pigeons, though.

00:42:10.325 --> 00:42:11.325
Lucky.

00:42:11.485 --> 00:42:13.205
Or just good aim.

00:42:13.365 --> 00:42:14.805
You were awake when you fell.

00:42:16.885 --> 00:42:18.845
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

00:42:19.045 --> 00:42:20.645
Right through the ceiling.

00:42:20.805 --> 00:42:24.725
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

00:42:24.925 --> 00:42:26.085
Here.

00:42:27.405 --> 00:42:29.565
Didn't think those would fit
you until you shrunk down

00:42:29.685 --> 00:42:32.165
to a regular-size feller.

00:42:34.565 --> 00:42:35.605
Thank you.

00:42:37.005 --> 00:42:38.005
Are you an alien?

00:42:38.605 --> 00:42:39.805
What?

00:42:40.085 --> 00:42:41.445
From outer space, an alien.

00:42:42.045 --> 00:42:43.045
No.

00:42:43.445 --> 00:42:46.605
Well, then, son,
you've got a condition.

00:42:57.565 --> 00:42:59.765
Clint.
You're going to be all right.

00:43:03.245 --> 00:43:05.365
You know that?

00:43:05.965 --> 00:43:07.925
Is that what you know?

00:43:10.285 --> 00:43:13.245
I've got no window.

00:43:13.965 --> 00:43:15.245
I have to flush him out.

00:43:16.285 --> 00:43:18.165
- You got to level out.
- It's gonna take time.

00:43:18.245 --> 00:43:19.805
You don't understand.

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:24.885
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

00:43:25.805 --> 00:43:29.965
Pull you out and stuff
something else in?

00:43:33.125 --> 00:43:35.325
Do you know what
it's like to be unmade?

00:43:37.045 --> 00:43:39.325
You know that I do.

00:43:47.045 --> 00:43:48.045
Why am I back?

00:43:49.245 --> 00:43:50.525
How'd you get him out?

00:43:50.725 --> 00:43:53.005
Cognitive recalibration.

00:43:53.565 --> 00:43:55.765
I hit you really
hard on the head.

00:43:56.485 --> 00:43:57.485
Thanks.

00:44:01.525 --> 00:44:02.525
Natasha...

00:44:04.325 --> 00:44:05.365
How many agents did I...

00:44:05.525 --> 00:44:06.845
Don't.

00:44:07.005 --> 00:44:09.205
Don't do that to
yourself, Clint.

00:44:09.845 --> 00:44:11.525
This is Loki.

00:44:11.965 --> 00:44:14.325
This is monsters and magic,

00:44:14.405 --> 00:44:16.005
and nothing we
were ever trained for.

00:44:16.365 --> 00:44:17.645
Loki, did he get away?

00:44:17.725 --> 00:44:18.725
Yeah.

00:44:19.205 --> 00:44:21.365
I don't suppose you know where.

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:23.285
I didn't need to know.

00:44:23.445 --> 00:44:25.245
I didn't ask.

00:44:28.445 --> 00:44:30.965
He's gonna make
his play soon, though.

00:44:31.285 --> 00:44:32.285
Today.

00:44:32.445 --> 00:44:33.685
We got to stop him.

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:35.805
Yeah? Who's "we"?

00:44:35.885 --> 00:44:37.845
I don't know. Whoever's left.

00:44:39.045 --> 00:44:40.045
Well,

00:44:42.045 --> 00:44:44.245
if I put an arrow through
Loki's eye socket,

00:44:44.405 --> 00:44:47.085
I'd sleep better, I suppose.

00:44:49.885 --> 00:44:51.405
Now you sound like you.

00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:53.565
But you don't.

00:44:55.565 --> 00:44:58.325
You're a spy, not a soldier.

00:44:58.485 --> 00:45:03.285
Now you want to
wade into a war. Why?

00:45:04.965 --> 00:45:07.005
What did Loki do to you?

00:45:07.725 --> 00:45:10.165
He didn't. I just...

00:45:13.925 --> 00:45:15.445
Natasha.

00:45:17.485 --> 00:45:19.605
I've been compromised.

00:45:22.605 --> 00:45:24.765
I got red in my ledger.

00:45:26.805 --> 00:45:28.925
I'd like to wipe it out.

00:45:44.965 --> 00:45:46.445
Was he married?

00:45:46.605 --> 00:45:47.925
No.

00:45:48.125 --> 00:45:52.365
There was a cellist, I think.

00:45:53.965 --> 00:45:55.365
I'm sorry.

00:45:56.045 --> 00:45:57.685
He seemed like a good man.

00:45:59.005 --> 00:46:00.005
He was an idiot.

00:46:00.205 --> 00:46:02.365
Why? For believing?

00:46:02.565 --> 00:46:03.965
For taking on Loki alone.

00:46:04.125 --> 00:46:05.805
He was doing his job.

00:46:05.965 --> 00:46:08.485
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

00:46:08.645 --> 00:46:09.645
He should have...

00:46:09.965 --> 00:46:11.565
Sometimes there
isn't a way out, Tony.

00:46:11.645 --> 00:46:13.725
Right, I've heard that before.

00:46:13.805 --> 00:46:15.325
Is this the first time
you lost a soldier?

00:46:15.485 --> 00:46:17.205
We are not soldiers.

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:23.405
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

00:46:23.645 --> 00:46:24.645
Neither am I.

00:46:24.805 --> 00:46:27.085
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

00:46:27.245 --> 00:46:28.645
But right now, we got
to put that behind us

00:46:28.725 --> 00:46:30.885
and get this done.

00:46:31.045 --> 00:46:32.045
Loki needs a power source.

00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:33.125
If we can put together a list...

00:46:33.205 --> 00:46:34.205
He made it personal.

00:46:34.485 --> 00:46:35.485
That's not the point.

00:46:35.645 --> 00:46:37.925
That is the point.
That's Loki's point.

00:46:38.085 --> 00:46:39.925
He hit us all right
where we live. Why?

00:46:40.085 --> 00:46:41.085
To tear us apart.

00:46:41.245 --> 00:46:43.085
Yeah, divide and
conquer is great,

00:46:43.245 --> 00:46:45.765
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

00:46:45.925 --> 00:46:47.325
That's what he wants.

00:46:47.525 --> 00:46:49.925
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

00:46:50.085 --> 00:46:51.245
He wants an audience.

00:46:52.005 --> 00:46:53.685
Right. I caught
his act in Stuttgart.

00:46:53.765 --> 00:46:56.765
Yeah, that's just previews.
This is opening night.

00:46:56.845 --> 00:46:59.445
And Loki, he's a
full-tilt diva, right?

00:46:59.525 --> 00:47:01.125
He wants flowers,
he wants parades.

00:47:01.205 --> 00:47:03.045
He wants a monument
built to the skies

00:47:03.205 --> 00:47:04.925
with his name plastered...

00:47:06.725 --> 00:47:08.325
Son of a bitch.

00:47:19.205 --> 00:47:20.285
Time to go.

00:47:20.765 --> 00:47:22.245
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

00:47:22.405 --> 00:47:23.485
Can you fly one of those jets?

00:47:25.045 --> 00:47:26.325
I can.

00:47:30.205 --> 00:47:31.205
You got a suit?

00:47:31.365 --> 00:47:32.405
Yeah.

00:47:32.485 --> 00:47:33.885
Then suit up.

00:48:01.365 --> 00:48:02.925
Hey, you guys aren't
authorized to be in here.

00:48:03.245 --> 00:48:05.285
Son, just don't.

00:48:07.405 --> 00:48:08.365
Sir.

00:48:08.445 --> 00:48:09.645
Agent Hill.

00:48:10.165 --> 00:48:11.805
Those cards,

00:48:13.925 --> 00:48:18.365
they were in Coulson's
locker, not in his jacket.

00:48:22.765 --> 00:48:24.365
They needed the push.

00:48:27.445 --> 00:48:28.685
<i>We have an
unauthorized departure</i>

00:48:28.765 --> 00:48:29.765
<i>from Bay 6.</i>

00:48:30.605 --> 00:48:31.925
They found him.

00:48:32.765 --> 00:48:34.165
Get our communications back up,

00:48:34.285 --> 00:48:36.285
whatever you have to do.

00:48:36.685 --> 00:48:39.045
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.

00:48:52.485 --> 00:48:54.205
<i>Sir, I've turned
off the arc reactor</i>

00:48:54.285 --> 00:48:58.045
<i>but the device is
already self-sustaining.</i>

00:48:58.205 --> 00:49:00.485
Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

00:49:01.045 --> 00:49:02.325
It's too late!

00:49:04.485 --> 00:49:05.965
She can't stop now.

00:49:06.965 --> 00:49:09.405
She wants to show us something!

00:49:09.685 --> 00:49:11.565
A new universe.

00:49:11.805 --> 00:49:13.245
Okay.

00:49:20.245 --> 00:49:22.205
<i>The barrier is pure energy.</i>

00:49:22.325 --> 00:49:24.085
<i>It's unbreachable.</i>

00:49:24.245 --> 00:49:26.085
Yeah, I got that.

00:49:27.245 --> 00:49:28.325
Plan B.

00:49:29.405 --> 00:49:31.525
<i>Sir, the Mark 7 is not
ready for deployment.</i>

00:49:31.685 --> 00:49:34.005
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

00:49:53.685 --> 00:49:56.725
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

00:49:57.845 --> 00:50:00.205
Actually, I'm planning
to threaten you.

00:50:00.365 --> 00:50:01.765
You should have left
your armor on for that.

00:50:01.965 --> 00:50:03.405
Yeah.

00:50:03.565 --> 00:50:04.565
It's seen a bit of mileage,

00:50:04.725 --> 00:50:07.285
and you've got the
glow stick of destiny.

00:50:08.085 --> 00:50:09.365
Would you like a drink?

00:50:10.445 --> 00:50:11.725
Stalling me won't
change anything.

00:50:11.885 --> 00:50:13.405
No, no. Threatening.

00:50:14.045 --> 00:50:15.405
No drink? Are you sure?

00:50:15.605 --> 00:50:16.725
I'm having one.

00:50:18.085 --> 00:50:22.045
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

00:50:22.885 --> 00:50:24.325
What have I to fear?

00:50:24.565 --> 00:50:26.125
The Avengers.

00:50:28.245 --> 00:50:30.485
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

00:50:30.645 --> 00:50:32.285
"Earth's mightiest
heroes" -type thing.

00:50:33.045 --> 00:50:34.285
Yes, I've met them.

00:50:34.565 --> 00:50:35.525
Yeah.

00:50:35.605 --> 00:50:36.805
It takes us a while
to get any traction,

00:50:36.885 --> 00:50:37.925
I'll give you that one.

00:50:38.085 --> 00:50:40.165
But let's do a head count, here.

00:50:40.325 --> 00:50:42.925
Your brother, the demigod,

00:50:44.565 --> 00:50:46.365
a super soldier, a living legend

00:50:46.445 --> 00:50:48.165
who kind of lives
up to the legend.

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:51.405
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

00:50:51.605 --> 00:50:54.765
a couple of master
assassins, and you, big fella,

00:50:55.405 --> 00:50:58.245
you've managed to piss
off every single one of them.

00:50:58.405 --> 00:50:59.445
That was the plan.

00:50:59.685 --> 00:51:01.485
Not a great plan.

00:51:01.645 --> 00:51:03.645
When they come,

00:51:03.805 --> 00:51:05.165
and they will,

00:51:05.365 --> 00:51:06.645
they'll come for you.

00:51:06.805 --> 00:51:07.805
I have an army.

00:51:07.925 --> 00:51:09.005
We have a Hulk.

00:51:09.525 --> 00:51:10.845
I thought the beast
had wandered off.

00:51:11.005 --> 00:51:12.925
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

00:51:13.125 --> 00:51:17.125
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

00:51:17.285 --> 00:51:18.405
Maybe your army comes

00:51:18.485 --> 00:51:19.605
and maybe it's too much for us,

00:51:19.685 --> 00:51:21.765
but it's all on you.

00:51:22.485 --> 00:51:23.605
Because if we can't
protect the Earth,

00:51:23.685 --> 00:51:26.125
you can be damn well
sure we'll avenge it.

00:51:28.965 --> 00:51:31.525
How will your friends
have time for me

00:51:32.045 --> 00:51:33.885
when they are so
busy fighting you?

00:51:41.365 --> 00:51:42.405
This usually works.

00:51:42.485 --> 00:51:45.405
Well, performance issues,
it's not uncommon.

00:51:45.485 --> 00:51:47.045
One out of five...

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:51.805
Jarvis, anytime now.

00:51:53.485 --> 00:51:56.205
You will all fall before me.

00:51:56.285 --> 00:51:57.725
Deploy!

00:51:57.805 --> 00:51:59.165
Deploy!

00:52:26.525 --> 00:52:29.285
And there's one other
person you pissed off.

00:52:30.525 --> 00:52:31.805
His name was Phil.

00:52:55.565 --> 00:52:56.965
Right.

00:52:57.205 --> 00:52:58.445
Army.

00:54:10.285 --> 00:54:11.365
Loki!

00:54:12.725 --> 00:54:14.365
Turn off the Tesseract,
or I'll destroy it.

00:54:14.445 --> 00:54:15.485
You can't.

00:54:15.645 --> 00:54:17.365
There is no stopping it.

00:54:17.525 --> 00:54:19.365
There is only

00:54:19.525 --> 00:54:20.525
the war.

00:54:20.725 --> 00:54:21.965
So be it.

00:54:43.965 --> 00:54:45.725
<i>Stark, we're on your
three, headed northeast.</i>

00:54:46.005 --> 00:54:47.925
What? Did you stop
for drive-through?

00:54:48.085 --> 00:54:49.725
Swing up Park.
I'm gonna lay 'em out for you.

00:55:08.045 --> 00:55:09.245
<i>Sir, we have more incoming.</i>

00:55:09.325 --> 00:55:11.085
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

00:55:18.045 --> 00:55:19.765
- Nat?
- I see him.

00:56:04.245 --> 00:56:05.885
We got to get back up there.

00:56:57.725 --> 00:56:59.445
Stark, are you seeing this?

00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:02.565
<i>Seeing.
Still working on believing.</i>

00:57:02.725 --> 00:57:03.965
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

00:57:04.205 --> 00:57:05.205
<i>Banner?</i>

00:57:05.365 --> 00:57:06.445
Just keep me posted.

00:57:07.125 --> 00:57:09.125
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

00:57:11.645 --> 00:57:13.365
Look at this!

00:57:13.445 --> 00:57:14.485
Look around you!

00:57:15.725 --> 00:57:19.045
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

00:57:19.605 --> 00:57:21.125
It's too late.

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:23.805
It's too late to stop it.

00:57:23.965 --> 00:57:27.805
No. We can, together.

00:57:34.485 --> 00:57:35.925
Sentiment.

00:58:04.085 --> 00:58:06.765
We've got civilians
still trapped up here.

00:58:07.885 --> 00:58:08.885
Loki.

00:58:20.525 --> 00:58:22.365
They're fish in a
barrel down there.

00:58:27.805 --> 00:58:29.805
We got this.
It's good. Go.

00:58:29.885 --> 00:58:31.285
Do you think you
can hold them off?

00:58:31.365 --> 00:58:32.365
Captain,

00:58:34.285 --> 00:58:36.285
it would be my genuine pleasure.

00:59:04.005 --> 00:59:05.765
Just like Budapest
all over again.

00:59:06.405 --> 00:59:08.965
You and I remember
Budapest very differently.

00:59:25.085 --> 00:59:26.085
It's going to be an hour

00:59:26.165 --> 00:59:27.445
before they can scramble
the National Guard.

00:59:27.605 --> 00:59:28.605
National Guard?

00:59:30.365 --> 00:59:31.805
Does the army know
what's happening here?

00:59:32.085 --> 00:59:33.125
Do we?

00:59:34.325 --> 00:59:35.565
You need men in these buildings.

00:59:35.645 --> 00:59:37.165
There are people inside and
they're going to be running

00:59:37.285 --> 00:59:38.525
right into the line of fire.

00:59:38.605 --> 00:59:40.485
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

00:59:40.645 --> 00:59:42.205
You keep them off the streets.

00:59:42.365 --> 00:59:45.045
I need a perimeter
as far back as 39th.

00:59:45.285 --> 00:59:46.805
Why the hell should I
take orders from you?

01:00:00.805 --> 01:00:01.965
I need men in those buildings.

01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:04.165
Lead the people down
and away from the streets.

01:00:04.325 --> 01:00:05.405
We're going to
set up a perimeter

01:00:05.485 --> 01:00:06.965
all the way down to 39th Street.

01:00:17.325 --> 01:00:18.965
Well, we got its attention.

01:00:19.245 --> 01:00:21.165
What the hell was step two?

01:00:50.445 --> 01:00:51.485
What's the story upstairs?

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.525
The power surrounding
the Cube is impenetrable.

01:00:53.605 --> 01:00:56.285
<i>Thor's right.
We got to deal with these guys.</i>

01:00:56.365 --> 01:00:58.005
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

01:00:58.085 --> 01:00:59.445
I have unfinished
business with Loki.

01:00:59.925 --> 01:01:01.045
Yeah? Well, get in line.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.125
Save it.

01:01:02.205 --> 01:01:03.605
Loki's going to keep
this fight focused on us,

01:01:03.685 --> 01:01:04.725
and that's what we need.

01:01:04.885 --> 01:01:06.525
Without him, these
things could run wild.

01:01:06.685 --> 01:01:08.445
We got Stark up top.
He's going to need us to...

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:20.805
So, this all seems horrible.

01:01:21.205 --> 01:01:22.365
I've seen worse.

01:01:22.885 --> 01:01:23.885
Sorry.

01:01:23.965 --> 01:01:26.725
No, we could use a little worse.

01:01:26.965 --> 01:01:29.205
- Stark, we got him.
<i>- Banner?</i>

01:01:29.565 --> 01:01:30.565
Just like you said.

01:01:30.725 --> 01:01:33.725
Then tell him to suit up.
I'm bringing the party to you.

01:01:39.845 --> 01:01:41.725
I don't see how that's a party.

01:01:49.845 --> 01:01:50.805
Dr. Banner.

01:01:52.565 --> 01:01:54.405
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

01:01:55.405 --> 01:01:57.325
That's my secret, Captain.

01:01:59.605 --> 01:02:00.845
I'm always angry.

01:02:12.325 --> 01:02:13.965
Hold on!

01:02:43.845 --> 01:02:45.365
Send the rest.

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:53.485
Guys.

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:54.765
Call it, Captain.

01:02:54.845 --> 01:02:56.045
All right, listen up.

01:02:56.245 --> 01:02:57.405
Until we can close that portal,

01:02:57.485 --> 01:02:58.965
our priority is containment.

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:00.445
Barton, I want you on that roof.

01:03:00.525 --> 01:03:02.445
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

01:03:02.525 --> 01:03:03.925
Stark, you got the perimeter.

01:03:04.005 --> 01:03:05.245
Anything gets more
than three blocks out,

01:03:05.325 --> 01:03:06.885
you turn it back or
you turn it to ash.

01:03:06.965 --> 01:03:08.245
- Can you give me a lift?
- Right.

01:03:08.325 --> 01:03:09.405
Better clench up, Legolas.

01:03:13.005 --> 01:03:15.405
Thor, you got to try and
bottleneck that portal.

01:03:15.485 --> 01:03:16.725
Slow them down.

01:03:16.805 --> 01:03:18.925
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

01:03:21.245 --> 01:03:22.885
You and me, we stay
here on the ground.

01:03:23.005 --> 01:03:24.085
We keep the fighting here.

01:03:24.165 --> 01:03:25.165
And Hulk...

01:03:27.885 --> 01:03:28.925
Smash.

01:04:22.565 --> 01:04:23.725
Sir.

01:04:24.725 --> 01:04:25.725
The Council is on.

01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:33.925
Stark, you got a lot of
strays sniffing your tail.

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:37.765
I'm just trying to keep
them off the streets.

01:04:37.925 --> 01:04:40.085
Well, they can't
bank worth a damn.

01:04:40.245 --> 01:04:41.445
So find a tight corner.

01:04:41.525 --> 01:04:42.925
I will roger that.

01:05:05.805 --> 01:05:07.005
Oh, boy.

01:05:14.205 --> 01:05:15.685
Nice call.

01:05:15.765 --> 01:05:17.045
What else you got?

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:19.965
<i>Thor is taking on a
squadron down on Sixth.</i>

01:05:20.045 --> 01:05:22.285
And he didn't invite me.

01:06:01.765 --> 01:06:03.405
Captain, none of this is
going to mean a damn thing

01:06:03.485 --> 01:06:04.805
if we don't close that portal.

01:06:04.885 --> 01:06:06.565
Our biggest guns
couldn't touch it.

01:06:06.645 --> 01:06:08.525
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

01:06:10.845 --> 01:06:12.845
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

01:06:13.885 --> 01:06:15.005
I got a ride.

01:06:16.085 --> 01:06:17.165
I could use a boost, though.

01:06:19.725 --> 01:06:20.725
Are you sure about this?

01:06:21.165 --> 01:06:23.765
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

01:06:50.765 --> 01:06:52.565
Okay, turn, turn.

01:06:52.765 --> 01:06:54.565
Less! Less!

01:08:17.205 --> 01:08:20.205
<i>Captain, the bank
on 42nd past Madison.</i>

01:08:20.285 --> 01:08:22.085
<i>They've cornered a
lot of civilians in there.</i>

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:24.125
I'm on it.

01:08:44.205 --> 01:08:46.045
Everyone! Clear out!

01:09:15.925 --> 01:09:17.645
<i>Director Fury,</i>

01:09:17.725 --> 01:09:19.525
<i>the Council has made a decision.</i>

01:09:19.605 --> 01:09:22.445
I recognize the Council
has made a decision.

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:24.165
But given that it's a
stupid-ass decision,

01:09:24.245 --> 01:09:25.605
I have elected to ignore it.

01:09:25.765 --> 01:09:29.125
<i>Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.</i>

01:09:29.205 --> 01:09:30.245
<i>You scramble that jet...</i>

01:09:30.325 --> 01:09:33.085
That is the island of
Manhattan, Councilman.

01:09:33.165 --> 01:09:35.325
Until I'm certain my
team can't hold it,

01:09:35.405 --> 01:09:37.405
I will not order
a nuclear strike

01:09:37.525 --> 01:09:38.965
against a civilian population.

01:09:39.045 --> 01:09:41.525
<i>If we don't hold them
here, we lose everything.</i>

01:09:41.605 --> 01:09:43.885
If I send that bird
out, we already have.

01:09:48.125 --> 01:09:49.885
Oh, you.

01:09:52.085 --> 01:09:53.325
Hawkeye!

01:09:54.685 --> 01:09:55.685
Nat, what are you doing?

01:09:56.605 --> 01:09:57.605
A little help?

01:10:02.885 --> 01:10:03.885
I got him.

01:10:30.485 --> 01:10:31.485
Enough!

01:10:31.845 --> 01:10:34.325
You are, all of you, beneath me!

01:10:34.405 --> 01:10:37.205
I am a god, you dull creature.

01:10:37.285 --> 01:10:38.805
And I will not be bullied by...

01:10:48.645 --> 01:10:50.525
Puny god.

01:10:58.645 --> 01:11:00.125
The scepter...

01:11:01.245 --> 01:11:02.485
Doctor.

01:11:04.365 --> 01:11:07.165
Loki's scepter.
The energy.

01:11:07.325 --> 01:11:09.005
The Tesseract can't fight,

01:11:09.125 --> 01:11:11.165
but you can't protect
against yourself.

01:11:11.245 --> 01:11:12.245
It's not your fault.

01:11:12.325 --> 01:11:13.645
You didn't know
what you were doing.

01:11:16.725 --> 01:11:18.645
Actually, I think I did.

01:11:19.005 --> 01:11:21.205
I built in a safety to
cut their power source.

01:11:23.165 --> 01:11:24.565
Loki's scepter.

01:11:24.725 --> 01:11:27.325
It may be able to
close the portal.

01:11:29.365 --> 01:11:31.565
And I'm looking right at it.

01:11:43.485 --> 01:11:44.885
<i>Sir, we will lose power</i>

01:11:44.965 --> 01:11:47.405
<i>before we penetrate that shell.</i>

01:11:54.005 --> 01:11:57.365
Jarvis, you ever hear
the tale of Jonah?

01:11:57.445 --> 01:11:59.845
<i>I wouldn't consider
him a role model.</i>

01:13:09.405 --> 01:13:11.245
<i>Director Fury is no
longer in command.</i>

01:13:11.325 --> 01:13:13.485
<i>Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.</i>

01:13:13.565 --> 01:13:16.125
<i>- 7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed.</i>
<i>- We're go for takeoff.</i>

01:13:17.005 --> 01:13:19.085
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

01:13:19.605 --> 01:13:21.645
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

01:13:21.725 --> 01:13:23.005
We need to shut it down!

01:13:23.085 --> 01:13:25.365
Repeat, takeoff
is not authorized.

01:13:55.845 --> 01:13:57.645
Stark, do you hear me?

01:13:58.165 --> 01:14:00.205
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

01:14:00.845 --> 01:14:01.845
How long?

01:14:02.365 --> 01:14:04.045
<i>Three minutes, max.</i>

01:14:04.525 --> 01:14:06.165
<i>The payload will
wipe out Midtown.</i>

01:14:06.445 --> 01:14:08.365
Jarvis, put everything
we got into the thrusters.

01:14:08.525 --> 01:14:10.245
<i>I just did.</i>

01:14:23.005 --> 01:14:24.365
Package is sent.

01:14:24.805 --> 01:14:27.605
<i>Detonation in 2 minutes,
30 seconds, mark.</i>

01:14:50.445 --> 01:14:52.445
Are you ready for another bout?

01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:54.485
What, are you getting sleepy?

01:15:00.045 --> 01:15:01.405
Right at the crown!

01:15:07.845 --> 01:15:09.605
I can close it.

01:15:09.765 --> 01:15:11.725
Can anybody copy?

01:15:11.885 --> 01:15:13.085
I can shut the portal down.

01:15:13.405 --> 01:15:15.165
- Do it!
<i>- No, wait.</i>

01:15:15.325 --> 01:15:16.605
Stark, these things
are still coming.

01:15:16.685 --> 01:15:17.645
I got a nuke coming in.

01:15:17.725 --> 01:15:19.845
It's gonna blow in
less than a minute.

01:15:29.565 --> 01:15:31.245
And I know just where to put it.

01:15:38.405 --> 01:15:40.805
<i>Stark, you know
that's a one-way trip.</i>

01:15:40.885 --> 01:15:42.325
Save the rest for the turn, J.

01:15:42.405 --> 01:15:46.085
<i>Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?</i>

01:15:46.645 --> 01:15:48.085
Might as well.

01:15:50.565 --> 01:15:51.685
<i>The streets of New York City</i>

01:15:51.765 --> 01:15:53.005
<i>have become a battleground.</i>

01:15:53.085 --> 01:15:55.805
<i>The Army is here trying
to contain the violence</i>

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:57.405
<i>but clearly, it is outmatched.</i>

01:15:57.525 --> 01:15:59.845
<i>And I have to say, in
all my years of reporting,</i>

01:15:59.925 --> 01:16:02.885
<i>I have never seen
anything like this.</i>

01:16:02.965 --> 01:16:04.525
<i>We have limited
information on the team,</i>

01:16:04.605 --> 01:16:08.405
<i>but we do know that billionaire
Tony Stark's Iron Man...</i>

01:17:21.965 --> 01:17:23.605
Come on, Stark.

01:17:30.165 --> 01:17:31.365
Close it.

01:17:51.365 --> 01:17:52.365
Son of a gun.

01:17:56.925 --> 01:17:58.045
He's not slowing down.

01:18:16.805 --> 01:18:18.325
Is he breathing?

01:18:46.165 --> 01:18:47.565
What the hell?

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:52.405
What just happened?

01:18:52.565 --> 01:18:54.365
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:00.805
We won.

01:19:03.125 --> 01:19:04.405
All right, yay!

01:19:04.565 --> 01:19:06.485
Hurray. Good job, guys.

01:19:06.645 --> 01:19:09.845
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

01:19:10.725 --> 01:19:12.325
Have you ever tried shawarma?

01:19:12.725 --> 01:19:14.965
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:16.845
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

01:19:17.245 --> 01:19:18.725
We're not finished yet.

01:19:23.645 --> 01:19:25.805
And then shawarma after.

01:19:47.445 --> 01:19:49.485
If it's all the same to you,

01:19:53.005 --> 01:19:54.805
I'll have that drink now.

01:20:02.525 --> 01:20:04.565
<i>Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed</i>

01:20:04.685 --> 01:20:06.485
<i>as an extraterrestrial attack,</i>

01:20:06.565 --> 01:20:08.125
<i>the extraordinary heroics</i>

01:20:08.205 --> 01:20:10.125
<i>of the group known
as the Avengers</i>

01:20:10.285 --> 01:20:11.885
<i>has been to many a
cause not only for comfort,</i>

01:20:11.965 --> 01:20:12.965
<i>but for celebration.</i>

01:20:13.045 --> 01:20:15.565
<i>It's just really great
knowing they're out there.</i>

01:20:15.645 --> 01:20:17.445
<i>That someone is
watching over us.</i>

01:20:17.525 --> 01:20:18.765
<i>I love you, Thor!</i>

01:20:18.845 --> 01:20:20.605
<i>And then these guys were like...</i>

01:20:20.685 --> 01:20:22.045
<i>And then the air goes...</i>

01:20:22.205 --> 01:20:23.605
<i>And this green guy
walks up and he goes...</i>

01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:24.765
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:20:24.845 --> 01:20:27.365
<i>I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.</i>

01:20:27.445 --> 01:20:30.485
<i>It just seems that there's
a lot they're not telling us.</i>

01:20:30.645 --> 01:20:34.125
<i>Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.</i>

01:20:34.285 --> 01:20:36.045
<i>These so-called "heroes"</i>

01:20:36.205 --> 01:20:37.845
<i>have to be held responsible</i>

01:20:37.925 --> 01:20:40.005
<i>for the destruction
done to this city.</i>

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:42.085
<i>This was their fight.
Where are they now?</i>

01:20:42.165 --> 01:20:43.445
<i>Tough questions are being asked</i>

01:20:43.525 --> 01:20:45.085
<i>about the Avengers themselves.</i>

01:20:45.165 --> 01:20:46.205
<i>Their sudden appearance</i>

01:20:46.285 --> 01:20:47.605
<i>and equally sudden
disappearance...</i>

01:20:47.685 --> 01:20:50.605
<i>What, this is all
somehow their fault?</i>

01:20:52.645 --> 01:20:55.845
<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>

01:20:57.925 --> 01:21:01.285
<i>Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,</i>

01:21:01.445 --> 01:21:02.765
<i>I would just...</i>

01:21:03.845 --> 01:21:06.205
<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>

01:21:08.605 --> 01:21:10.085
<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>

01:21:10.245 --> 01:21:12.565
I'm not currently tracking
their whereabouts.

01:21:12.725 --> 01:21:15.005
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

01:21:15.085 --> 01:21:16.645
<i>And the Tesseract?</i>

01:21:16.725 --> 01:21:19.085
<i>The Tesseract is
where it belongs.</i>

01:21:19.445 --> 01:21:21.765
<i>Out of our reach.</i>

01:21:21.925 --> 01:21:23.405
<i>That's not your call.</i>

01:21:23.565 --> 01:21:24.645
I didn't make it.

01:21:24.765 --> 01:21:27.085
I just didn't argue
with the god that did.

01:21:27.245 --> 01:21:28.845
<i>So, you let him take it</i>

01:21:29.005 --> 01:21:30.685
<i>and the war criminal, Loki,</i>

01:21:30.765 --> 01:21:32.485
<i>who should be
answering for his crime.</i>

01:21:32.645 --> 01:21:35.245
<i>Oh, I think he will be.</i>

01:21:48.605 --> 01:21:50.285
<i>I don't think you understand</i>

01:21:50.365 --> 01:21:51.365
<i>what you've started,</i>

01:21:51.685 --> 01:21:53.925
<i>letting the Avengers
loose on this world.</i>

01:21:54.445 --> 01:21:55.485
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

01:21:55.725 --> 01:21:59.285
<i>They surely are, and
the whole world knows it.</i>

01:21:59.765 --> 01:22:02.445
Every world knows it.

01:22:02.805 --> 01:22:04.965
<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>

01:22:05.245 --> 01:22:06.805
<i>A statement?</i>

01:22:09.445 --> 01:22:10.965
<i>A promise.</i>

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.205
<i>Sir, how does it work now?</i>

01:22:22.325 --> 01:22:24.405
They've gone
their separate ways.

01:22:24.565 --> 01:22:27.445
Some, pretty extremely far.

01:22:28.165 --> 01:22:30.125
If we get into a
situation like this again,

01:22:30.205 --> 01:22:31.685
what happens then?

01:22:31.845 --> 01:22:32.845
They'll come back.

01:22:34.325 --> 01:22:36.085
Are you really sure about that?

01:22:36.165 --> 01:22:37.165
I am.

01:22:38.325 --> 01:22:39.365
Why?

01:22:41.085 --> 01:22:43.245
Because we'll need them to.

01:23:38.092 --> 01:23:40.612
Humans.

01:23:41.932 --> 01:23:46.292
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

01:23:47.212 --> 01:23:49.412
They stand.

01:23:50.212 --> 01:23:56.732
They are unruly, and
therefore cannot be ruled.

01:24:03.652 --> 01:24:06.492
To challenge them

01:24:06.652 --> 01:24:10.412
is to court death.
