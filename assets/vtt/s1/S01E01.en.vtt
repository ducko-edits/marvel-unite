00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.220
<i>You want to know
what went wrong.</i>

00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:03.998
Fury says to me once,

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:08.348
"In the time of gods and monsters,
what is the worth of a man?"

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.504
I don't know what he means.

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:18.132
And then men
are dying all round.

00:01:19.632 --> 00:01:22.232
Good men. Friends.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.669
<i>Even some heroes.</i>

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.904
<i>So it's safe to say mistakes were
made in the handling of the incident?</i>

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:33.489
Mistakes?

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:37.875
We're at war, and he
thinks about superheroes.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.510
<i>The Avengers?</i>

00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:42.621
<i>You thought they were a threat.</i>

00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:45.171
I thought they were a joke.

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:51.880
Nick Fury only ever saw them as
the Avengers, no matter what he said.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.517
<i>It was absolutely a bad idea.</i>

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:02.442
<i>The wrong people at the
wrong time, and it worked.</i>

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:09.629
<i>They came together, and they
saved us, and it's infuriating.</i>

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.580
<i>We're trained to believe in a system,
not to gamble. Not to hope.</i>

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:24.233
<i>Nick Fury saw something
running under the system.</i>

00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:26.761
<i>A current,
a connection, a truth...</i>

00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:33.661
<i>about what we can do,
what they would become.</i>

00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:42.411
Captain America saved my life.

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.899
<i>The Avengers were the
mistake that saved the world.</i>

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.999
That's my official statement.

00:03:32.607 --> 00:03:33.847
<i>Tony Stark.</i>

00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:37.807
<i>Visionary. Genius.</i>

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:40.327
<i>American patriot.</i>

00:03:40.607 --> 00:03:41.767
<i>Even from an early age,</i>

00:03:41.807 --> 00:03:44.327
<i>the son of legendary weapons
developer Howard Stark</i>

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:47.967
<i>quickly stole the spotlight with
his brilliant and unique mind.</i>

00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:51.487
<i>At age four, he built
his first circuit board.</i>

00:03:51.527 --> 00:03:53.687
<i>At age six, his first engine.</i>

00:03:54.327 --> 00:03:58.207
<i>And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.</i>

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:01.567
<i>Then, the passing of a titan.</i>

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:06.087
<i>Howard Stark's lifelong
friend and ally, Obadiah Stane,</i>

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:09.607
<i>steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,</i>

00:04:09.807 --> 00:04:13.127
<i>until, at age 21, the
prodigal son returns</i>

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:16.607
<i>and is anointed the new
CEO of Stark Industries.</i>

00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:18.007
<i>With the keys to the kingdom,</i>

00:04:18.087 --> 00:04:20.887
<i>Tony ushers in a new
era for his father's legacy,</i>

00:04:20.967 --> 00:04:25.007
<i>creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.</i>

00:04:25.127 --> 00:04:29.007
<i>Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry</i>

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:31.887
<i>by ensuring freedom
and protecting America</i>

00:04:31.967 --> 00:04:34.527
<i>and her interests
around the globe.</i>

00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:45.207
As liaison to Stark Industries,

00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:49.567
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

00:04:49.727 --> 00:04:53.407
He is my friend and
he is my great mentor.

00:04:53.847 --> 00:04:56.047
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor

00:04:56.127 --> 00:05:00.447
to present this year's Apogee
Award to Mr. Tony Stark.

00:05:07.687 --> 00:05:09.007
Tony?

00:05:21.247 --> 00:05:23.887
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:27.647
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:29.167
This is wonderful.

00:05:31.047 --> 00:05:33.047
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

00:05:34.927 --> 00:05:40.047
But if I were Tony, I would
tell you how honored I feel

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:45.087
and what a joy it is to receive
this very prestigious award.

00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:46.967
Tony, you know...

00:05:47.087 --> 00:05:51.007
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

00:05:51.087 --> 00:05:52.447
He's always working.

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:57.967
Work it! Come on!

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.007
We should just
stay till the morning.

00:06:03.087 --> 00:06:05.087
You are unbelievable.

00:06:05.127 --> 00:06:06.807
Oh, no!
Did they rope you into this?

00:06:06.847 --> 00:06:08.447
Nobody roped me into anything!

00:06:08.527 --> 00:06:09.487
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

00:06:09.607 --> 00:06:12.447
if I presented you with an
award, you'd be deeply honored.

00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:14.487
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

00:06:14.527 --> 00:06:16.247
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

00:06:16.287 --> 00:06:18.487
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

00:06:18.567 --> 00:06:19.927
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

00:06:19.967 --> 00:06:22.327
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

00:06:22.407 --> 00:06:23.967
I don't have any of
those floating around.

00:06:24.047 --> 00:06:26.127
We're gonna let it ride!

00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:29.407
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

00:06:29.487 --> 00:06:30.607
Okay, you, too.

00:06:30.647 --> 00:06:32.567
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

00:06:32.647 --> 00:06:35.167
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

00:06:35.247 --> 00:06:36.487
Two craps. Line away.

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:38.407
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

00:06:38.487 --> 00:06:39.927
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

00:06:40.447 --> 00:06:41.487
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

00:06:41.527 --> 00:06:42.527
Tomorrow, don't be late.

00:06:42.607 --> 00:06:43.887
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

00:06:43.967 --> 00:06:45.247
I know, I know.

00:06:45.327 --> 00:06:48.847
Render unto Caesar that
which is Caesar's. There you go.

00:06:53.207 --> 00:06:55.527
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

00:06:55.847 --> 00:06:58.127
Christine Everhart,
<i>Vanity Fair</i> magazine.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:06:59.327
Can I ask you a
couple of questions?

00:06:59.327 --> 00:07:00.847
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

00:07:01.007 --> 00:07:02.007
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:04.007
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

00:07:04.087 --> 00:07:05.927
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

00:07:06.007 --> 00:07:08.847
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

00:07:08.927 --> 00:07:10.527
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

00:07:10.607 --> 00:07:11.807
"The Merchant of Death"?

00:07:11.847 --> 00:07:13.407
That's not bad.

00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:16.247
Let me guess. Berkeley?

00:07:16.327 --> 00:07:17.487
Brown, actually.

00:07:17.527 --> 00:07:19.967
Well, Ms. Brown,

00:07:20.527 --> 00:07:22.487
it's an imperfect world, but
it's the only one we've got.

00:07:22.527 --> 00:07:25.287
I guarantee you, the day weapons
are no longer needed to keep the peace,

00:07:25.367 --> 00:07:27.527
I'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:28.727
Rehearse that much?

00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:30.447
Every night in front of
the mirror before bedtime.

00:07:30.527 --> 00:07:31.567
I can see that.

00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:32.887
I'd like to show you first-hand.

00:07:32.967 --> 00:07:35.207
All I want is a serious answer.

00:07:35.287 --> 00:07:37.567
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:40.047
"Peace means having a
bigger stick than the other guy."

00:07:40.087 --> 00:07:42.407
That's a great line coming
from the guy selling the sticks.

00:07:42.487 --> 00:07:43.807
My father helped
defeat the Nazis.

00:07:43.887 --> 00:07:45.287
He worked on the
Manhattan Project.

00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:47.927
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,

00:07:48.007 --> 00:07:49.247
would call that being a hero.

00:07:49.287 --> 00:07:51.487
And a lot of people would
also call that war profiteering.

00:07:51.567 --> 00:07:53.727
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:55.567
by advancing medical technology

00:07:55.607 --> 00:07:58.007
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

00:07:58.087 --> 00:08:01.327
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

00:08:02.927 --> 00:08:04.847
You ever lose an hour
of sleep your whole life?

00:08:04.927 --> 00:08:06.807
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.

00:08:21.007 --> 00:08:22.687
<i>Good morning.
It's 7:00 a.m.</i>

00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:26.447
<i>The weather in Malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.</i>

00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:29.927
<i>The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.</i>

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:32.447
<i>High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.</i>

00:08:49.447 --> 00:08:50.807
Tony?

00:08:52.167 --> 00:08:53.567
Hey, Tony?

00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:17.647
<i>You are not authorized
to access this area.</i>

00:09:17.727 --> 00:09:20.447
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:23.567
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:25.407
and there's a car
waiting for you outside

00:09:25.487 --> 00:09:27.807
that will take you
anywhere you'd like to go.

00:09:28.127 --> 00:09:30.607
You must be the
famous Pepper Potts.

00:09:30.687 --> 00:09:32.367
Indeed I am.

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:37.127
After all these years, Tony still
has you picking up the dry-cleaning.

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:40.567
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:43.447
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

00:09:43.527 --> 00:09:44.607
Will that be all?

00:09:45.807 --> 00:09:46.847
<i>♪ Sometimes I try to do things</i>

00:09:46.927 --> 00:09:49.247
<i>♪ but it just doesn't work
out the way I want it to,</i>

00:09:49.367 --> 00:09:51.527
<i>♪ and I get real frustrated</i>

00:09:51.567 --> 00:09:53.567
<i>♪ and then, like, I
try hard to do it</i>

00:09:53.647 --> 00:09:54.967
<i>♪ and I, like, take my time</i>

00:09:55.007 --> 00:09:56.807
<i>♪ but it just doesn't work
out the way I want it to.</i>

00:09:56.847 --> 00:09:59.007
<i>♪ It's like I concentrate
on it real hard</i>

00:09:59.087 --> 00:10:01.487
<i>♪ but it just doesn't work out.</i>

00:10:01.527 --> 00:10:03.167
Give me an exploded view.

00:10:03.207 --> 00:10:06.487
<i>The compression in cylinder
three appears to be low.</i>

00:10:06.887 --> 00:10:08.127
Log that.

00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:12.887
I'm gonna try again, right now.

00:10:12.967 --> 00:10:13.967
Please don't turn down my music.

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:15.047
I'll keep you posted.

00:10:15.127 --> 00:10:16.887
You are supposed to be halfway
around the world right now.

00:10:16.967 --> 00:10:18.047
How'd she take it?

00:10:18.207 --> 00:10:19.327
Like a champ.

00:10:19.567 --> 00:10:20.967
Why are you trying to
hustle me out of here?

00:10:21.047 --> 00:10:22.767
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.

00:10:22.847 --> 00:10:24.967
That's funny, I thought with
it being my plane and all,

00:10:25.047 --> 00:10:26.607
that it would just wait
for me to get there.

00:10:26.687 --> 00:10:28.447
Tony, I need to speak to
you about a couple things

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:29.607
before I get you
out of the door.

00:10:29.687 --> 00:10:31.927
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:33.247
if it departs before you arrive?

00:10:33.327 --> 00:10:36.687
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

00:10:36.727 --> 00:10:38.407
Do you want it? Yes or no.

00:10:38.447 --> 00:10:40.567
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

00:10:41.367 --> 00:10:43.847
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:45.207
where he lived and worked,

00:10:45.247 --> 00:10:46.767
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:48.967
I think it's a fair example.

00:10:49.087 --> 00:10:51.247
I think it's incredibly
overpriced.

00:10:52.087 --> 00:10:54.687
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

00:10:55.407 --> 00:10:58.047
Okay. The MIT
commencement speech...

00:10:58.087 --> 00:11:00.927
Is in June. Please, don't harangue
me about stuff that's way, way, down...

00:11:01.007 --> 00:11:03.407
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

00:11:03.527 --> 00:11:05.007
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

00:11:05.087 --> 00:11:06.447
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

00:11:06.527 --> 00:11:08.447
What are you trying to get rid
of me for? What, you got plans?

00:11:08.527 --> 00:11:09.607
As a matter of fact, I do.

00:11:09.687 --> 00:11:11.047
I don't like it when
you have plans.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.167
I'm allowed to have
plans on my birthday.

00:11:13.247 --> 00:11:14.767
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

00:11:14.847 --> 00:11:16.327
I knew that. Already?

00:11:16.407 --> 00:11:19.927
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.167
Get yourself
something nice from me.

00:11:22.247 --> 00:11:23.447
I already did.

00:11:23.527 --> 00:11:24.527
And?

00:11:24.607 --> 00:11:26.087
Oh, it was very nice.

00:11:26.127 --> 00:11:27.775
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful.

00:11:28.267 --> 00:11:29.915
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

00:11:30.207 --> 00:11:32.287
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

00:11:35.447 --> 00:11:36.447
Okay.

00:11:54.887 --> 00:11:58.487
You're good.
Oh, I thought I lost you back there.

00:11:59.087 --> 00:12:03.007
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

00:12:03.367 --> 00:12:04.687
I got you. I got you.

00:12:04.767 --> 00:12:06.207
What's wrong with you?

00:12:06.287 --> 00:12:07.807
- What?
- Three hours.

00:12:07.887 --> 00:12:10.047
I got caught doing a
piece for <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

00:12:10.127 --> 00:12:12.127
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:14.687
Waiting on you now.
Let's go. Come on.

00:12:15.327 --> 00:12:17.327
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

00:12:25.367 --> 00:12:28.007
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:30.287
Come on, sour patch.
Don't be mad.

00:12:30.367 --> 00:12:33.087
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:34.647
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:35.847
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

00:12:35.927 --> 00:12:36.967
Hi. I told him I
was sorry, but he...

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:38.447
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

00:12:38.527 --> 00:12:39.727
You don't respect yourself,

00:12:39.807 --> 00:12:41.207
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

00:12:41.247 --> 00:12:42.607
I'm just your babysitter.

00:12:42.687 --> 00:12:45.207
So, when you need your diaper changed...
Thank you.

00:12:45.287 --> 00:12:47.447
Let me know and I'll
get you a bottle, okay?

00:12:47.527 --> 00:12:49.207
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

00:12:49.287 --> 00:12:50.687
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

00:12:50.727 --> 00:12:52.527
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

00:12:52.567 --> 00:12:55.047
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

00:12:55.087 --> 00:12:56.687
incapable of being responsible.

00:12:56.807 --> 00:12:58.207
It would be
irresponsible not to drink.

00:12:58.247 --> 00:12:59.327
I'm just talking
about a nightcap.

00:12:59.367 --> 00:13:00.447
Hot sake?

00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:01.567
Yes, two, please. No.

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:03.887
I'm not drinking.
I don't want any.

00:13:03.927 --> 00:13:05.287
That's what I'm talking about.

00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:08.447
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

00:13:08.527 --> 00:13:10.247
you know what I recognize?

00:13:10.327 --> 00:13:15.607
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

00:13:15.687 --> 00:13:18.407
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

00:13:18.447 --> 00:13:19.967
No, no.
You don't have to be like me!

00:13:20.047 --> 00:13:21.567
But you're more
than what you are.

00:13:21.607 --> 00:13:23.487
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

00:13:23.567 --> 00:13:26.607
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.420
General.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.100
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look
forward to your weapons presentation.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.220
Thanks.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.980
Is it better to be
feared or respected?

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.220
I say, is it too much
to ask for both?

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.060
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.940
of Stark Industries'
Freedom Line.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.060
It's the first missile system

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.020
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.060
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.140
I respectfully disagree.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.260
I prefer the weapon you
only have to fire once.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.700
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.580
And it's worked out
pretty well so far.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.060
Find an excuse

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.420
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.060
the bad guys won't even
want to come out of their caves.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.300
For your consideration,
the Jericho.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.940
I'll be throwing one of these in

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.020
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.140
To peace!

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.940
<i>- Tony.</i>
- Obie, what are you doing up?

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.500
<i>I couldn't sleep till I found
out how it went. How'd it go?</i>

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.380
It went great. Looks like it's
gonna be an early Christmas.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.340
<i>Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?</i>

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.900
Why aren't you wearing
those pajamas I got you?

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.580
<i>Good night, Tony.</i>

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.460
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.500
The "hum-drum-vee"
is back there.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.900
Nice job.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.300
See you back at base.

00:15:55.505 --> 00:15:57.265

00:16:02.105 --> 00:16:03.705
I feel like you're driving
me to a court-martial.

00:16:03.785 --> 00:16:05.825
This is crazy. What did I do?

00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:07.345
I feel like you're going
to pull over and snuff me.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.865
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

00:16:09.905 --> 00:16:11.145
We can talk, sir.

00:16:11.185 --> 00:16:13.665
Oh, I see. So it's personal?

00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:15.025
No, you intimidate them.

00:16:15.065 --> 00:16:16.585
Good God, you're a woman.

00:16:16.665 --> 00:16:18.305
I honestly...
I couldn't have called that.

00:16:18.385 --> 00:16:20.825
I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?

00:16:20.865 --> 00:16:22.305
I thought of you
as a soldier first.

00:16:22.385 --> 00:16:23.705
I'm an airman.

00:16:23.745 --> 00:16:25.545
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:28.385
I'm kind of having a hard
time not looking at you now.

00:16:28.465 --> 00:16:31.225
Is that weird?
Come on, it's okay, laugh.

00:16:31.665 --> 00:16:33.065
Sir, I have a question to ask.

00:16:33.145 --> 00:16:34.185
Yes, please.

00:16:34.225 --> 00:16:37.945
Is it true you went 12 for 12 with
last year's <i>Maxim</i> cover models?

00:16:38.025 --> 00:16:40.185
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

00:16:40.225 --> 00:16:41.745
March and I had a
scheduling conflict,

00:16:41.785 --> 00:16:44.745
but fortunately, the
Christmas cover was twins.

00:16:44.785 --> 00:16:47.705
Anything else?
You're kidding me with the hand up, right?

00:16:47.745 --> 00:16:49.545
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?

00:16:49.585 --> 00:16:51.465
Yes. It's very cool.

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:56.585
All right.

00:16:56.625 --> 00:16:58.745
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

00:16:58.825 --> 00:17:00.425
Please, no gang signs.

00:17:00.505 --> 00:17:02.065
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

00:17:02.185 --> 00:17:03.905
Yeah, peace. I love peace.

00:17:03.985 --> 00:17:05.265
I'd be out of a job with peace.

00:17:05.345 --> 00:17:09.185
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

00:17:14.945 --> 00:17:16.985

- Contact left!

00:17:17.065 --> 00:17:18.785

00:17:20.025 --> 00:17:22.105

00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:23.705
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

00:17:29.585 --> 00:17:31.105
Son of a bitch!

00:17:32.745 --> 00:17:34.105
Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!

Rogers, Steven.

00:19:10.718 --> 00:19:13.558
It kind of makes you think
twice about enlisting, huh?

00:19:14.078 --> 00:19:15.238
Nope.

00:19:18.198 --> 00:19:19.718
Rogers.

00:19:25.918 --> 00:19:28.558
- What did your father die of?
- Mustard gas.

00:19:29.398 --> 00:19:30.798
He was in the 107th Infantry.

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:32.598
I was hoping I
could be assigned...

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:35.398
- Your mother?
- She was a nurse in a TB ward.

00:19:35.558 --> 00:19:37.598
Got hit. Couldn't shake it.

00:19:42.118 --> 00:19:44.198
- Sorry, son.
- Look, just give me a chance.

00:19:44.278 --> 00:19:46.838
You'd be ineligible
on your asthma alone.

00:19:47.278 --> 00:19:48.358
Is there anything you can do?

00:19:48.798 --> 00:19:50.158

00:24:51.773 --> 00:24:53.933
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

00:25:33.775 --> 00:25:35.575
Come on, soldier.

00:25:40.535 --> 00:25:42.695
Come on. You're kind of
missing the point of a double date.

00:25:42.735 --> 00:25:44.215
We're taking the girls dancing.

00:25:44.295 --> 00:25:46.415
You go ahead.
I'll catch up with you.

00:25:49.335 --> 00:25:51.335
You're really going
to do this again?

00:25:51.415 --> 00:25:52.935
Well, it's a fair.
I'm gonna try my luck.

00:25:53.015 --> 00:25:54.735
As who, Steve from Ohio?

00:25:54.815 --> 00:25:57.215
They'll catch you.
Or worse, they'll actually take you.

00:25:57.855 --> 00:25:59.215
Look, I know you
don't think I can do this.

00:25:59.255 --> 00:26:00.655
This isn't a back alley, Steve.
It's war.

00:26:00.735 --> 00:26:02.735
- I know it's a war.
- Why are you so keen to fight?

00:26:02.775 --> 00:26:04.655
- There are so many important jobs.
- What do you want me to do?

00:26:04.735 --> 00:26:06.695
Collect scrap metal
in my little red wagon?

00:26:06.735 --> 00:26:08.415
- Yes. Why not?
- I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.

00:26:08.455 --> 00:26:11.095
Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.

00:26:12.055 --> 00:26:14.215
I got no right to do
any less than them.

00:26:14.255 --> 00:26:16.935
That's what you don't understand.
This isn't about me.

00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:20.535
Right.
'Cause you got nothing to prove.

00:26:23.375 --> 00:26:26.255
Hey, Sarge!
Are we going dancing?

00:26:27.495 --> 00:26:29.255
Yes, we are.

00:26:35.095 --> 00:26:37.375
Don't do anything
stupid until I get back.

00:26:37.455 --> 00:26:38.495
How can I?

00:26:38.895 --> 00:26:40.775
You're taking all
the stupid with you.

00:26:43.455 --> 00:26:46.135
- You're a punk.
- Jerk.

00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:48.615
Be careful.

00:26:51.975 --> 00:26:53.455
Don't win the war
till I get there!

00:26:58.615 --> 00:27:01.575
Come on, girls.
They're playing our song.

00:27:21.095 --> 00:27:22.335
Wait here.

00:27:23.335 --> 00:27:25.775
- Is there a problem?
- Just wait here.

00:27:44.695 --> 00:27:46.015
Thank you.

00:27:49.855 --> 00:27:50.935
So,

00:27:51.655 --> 00:27:55.095
you want to go overseas.
Kill some Nazis.

00:27:56.455 --> 00:27:57.775
Excuse me?

00:27:58.095 --> 00:27:59.735
Dr. Abraham Erskine.

00:27:59.815 --> 00:28:02.535
I represent the Strategic
Scientific Reserve.

00:28:02.855 --> 00:28:03.975
Steve Rogers.

00:28:08.455 --> 00:28:10.055
Where are you from?

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:14.615
Queens.
73rd Street and Utopia Parkway.

00:28:15.055 --> 00:28:17.055
Before that, Germany.

00:28:18.055 --> 00:28:19.975
- This troubles you?
- No.

00:28:20.935 --> 00:28:23.095
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?
Hmm?

00:28:23.375 --> 00:28:25.135
Is it New Haven?

00:28:26.215 --> 00:28:27.655
Or Paramus?

00:28:28.655 --> 00:28:30.895
Five exams in
five different cities.

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:32.055
That might not
be the right file.

00:28:32.095 --> 00:28:33.975
No, it's not the exams
I'm interested in.

00:28:34.055 --> 00:28:36.215
It's the five tries.

00:28:37.255 --> 00:28:39.975
But you didn't
answer my question.

00:28:40.055 --> 00:28:41.415
Do you want to kill Nazis?

00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:45.415
Is this a test?

00:28:46.735 --> 00:28:48.095
Yes.

00:28:51.175 --> 00:28:52.855
I don't want to kill anyone.

00:28:53.575 --> 00:28:56.695
I don't like bullies.
I don't care where they're from.

00:28:58.415 --> 00:28:59.735
Well, there are already

00:28:59.774 --> 00:29:01.774
so many big men
fighting this war.

00:29:01.975 --> 00:29:04.295
Maybe what we need
now is a little guy, huh?

00:29:06.175 --> 00:29:07.655
I can offer you a chance.

00:29:09.015 --> 00:29:10.935
Only a chance.

00:29:10.975 --> 00:29:12.775
I'll take it. Good.

00:29:13.935 --> 00:29:17.775
So where is the little guy from?
Actually?

00:29:18.775 --> 00:29:20.095
Brooklyn.

00:29:22.295 --> 00:29:24.775
Congratulations, soldier.

00:29:42.086 --> 00:29:43.846
What the hell did you do to me?

00:29:44.686 --> 00:29:46.206
What I did?

00:29:47.526 --> 00:29:49.286
What I did is to save your life.

00:29:49.526 --> 00:29:53.166
I removed all the shrapnel
I could, but there's a lot left,

00:29:53.246 --> 00:29:55.046
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.

00:29:55.806 --> 00:29:57.566
Here, want to see?

00:29:58.246 --> 00:30:01.046
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

00:30:03.726 --> 00:30:05.966
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.

00:30:06.006 --> 00:30:08.486
We call them the walking dead

00:30:08.526 --> 00:30:11.726
because it takes about a week for
the barbs to reach the vital organs.

00:30:11.806 --> 00:30:14.606
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

00:30:15.366 --> 00:30:17.526
hooked up to a car battery,

00:30:17.566 --> 00:30:20.526
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart. Hmm?

00:30:28.766 --> 00:30:30.886
That's right. Smile.

00:30:32.566 --> 00:30:36.726
We met once, you know, at a
technical conference in Bern.

00:30:37.206 --> 00:30:39.766
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

00:30:40.126 --> 00:30:43.246
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

00:30:43.286 --> 00:30:46.486
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

00:30:46.566 --> 00:30:47.886
Where are we?

00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:51.726
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

00:30:52.686 --> 00:30:54.726
Just do as I do.

00:30:55.406 --> 00:30:57.486
Come on, put your hands up.

00:30:59.246 --> 00:31:00.726
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

00:31:00.726 --> 00:31:03.166
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.

00:31:23.606 --> 00:31:27.846
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

00:31:27.926 --> 00:31:29.766
"in the history of America."

00:31:33.206 --> 00:31:34.726
He is honored.

00:31:37.206 --> 00:31:39.006
He wants you to
build the missile.

00:31:40.406 --> 00:31:42.726
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

00:31:46.286 --> 00:31:47.446
This one.

00:31:52.566 --> 00:31:53.566
I refuse.

00:32:04.326 --> 00:32:05.326
<i>Tony!</i>

00:32:55.326 --> 00:32:57.646
He wants to know what you think.

00:32:58.606 --> 00:33:00.406
I think you got a
lot of my weapons.

00:33:09.366 --> 00:33:13.526
He says they have everything
you need to build the Jericho missile.

00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:16.246
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

00:33:19.526 --> 00:33:22.126
He says for you to start
working immediately,

00:33:22.206 --> 00:33:25.486
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

00:33:28.926 --> 00:33:30.166
No, he won't.

00:33:30.766 --> 00:33:32.006
No, he won't.

00:33:41.094 --> 00:33:42.894
<i>Recruits, attention!</i>

00:33:44.097 --> 00:33:45.938
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.

00:33:46.001 --> 00:33:48.641
I supervise all
operations for this division.

00:33:48.774 --> 00:33:50.654
What's with the accent,
Queen Victoria?

00:33:51.533 --> 00:33:53.533
I thought I was signing up
for the U.S. Army.

00:33:53.722 --> 00:33:54.882
What's your name, soldier?

00:33:55.165 --> 00:33:56.885
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

00:33:56.925 --> 00:33:58.685
Step forward, Hodge.

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:01.805
Put your right foot forward.

00:34:03.205 --> 00:34:04.605
Mmm... We gonna wrassle?

00:34:06.365 --> 00:34:08.765
'Cause I got a few
moves I know you'll like.

00:34:11.605 --> 00:34:12.925
Agent Carter!

00:34:13.285 --> 00:34:14.645
Colonel Phillips.

00:34:14.725 --> 00:34:17.725
I can see that you are breaking
in the candidates. That's good!

00:34:18.445 --> 00:34:19.725
Get your ass up out of that dirt

00:34:19.765 --> 00:34:21.125
and stand in that
line at attention

00:34:21.165 --> 00:34:22.565
till somebody comes
tells you what to do.

00:34:22.605 --> 00:34:24.125
Yes, sir!

00:34:27.405 --> 00:34:29.725
General Patton has said

00:34:30.285 --> 00:34:33.965
that wars are fought with weapons,
but they are won by men.

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:37.645
We are going to win this war
because we have the best men.

00:34:41.965 --> 00:34:44.125
And because they
are going to get better.

00:34:44.205 --> 00:34:46.205
Much better.

00:34:47.045 --> 00:34:50.805
<i>The Strategic Scientific
Reserve is an Allied effort</i>

00:34:50.885 --> 00:34:54.325
<i>made up of the best
minds in the free world.</i>

00:34:54.405 --> 00:34:57.525
<i>Our goal is to create
the best army in history.</i>

00:34:58.045 --> 00:34:59.965
<i>But every army
starts with one man.</i>

00:35:00.365 --> 00:35:02.205
Rogers! Get off of there!

00:35:02.285 --> 00:35:04.405
<i>At the end of this week,
we will choose that man.</i>

00:35:04.925 --> 00:35:08.605
He will be the first in a
new breed of super-soldier.

00:35:14.845 --> 00:35:17.245
Rogers! Get that rifle
out of the mud!

00:35:17.325 --> 00:35:22.005
And they will personally escort
Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.

00:35:22.285 --> 00:35:24.445
Pick up the pace, ladies!

00:35:25.085 --> 00:35:28.525
Let's go, let's go! Double time!

00:35:28.885 --> 00:35:31.725
Come on! Faster! Faster!

00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:34.485
Move! Move!

00:35:34.845 --> 00:35:36.845
Squad, halt!

00:35:37.485 --> 00:35:39.725
That flag means we're
only at the halfway point.

00:35:40.445 --> 00:35:43.845
First man to bring it to me gets
a ride back with Agent Carter.

00:35:43.925 --> 00:35:45.685
Move, move!

00:35:46.605 --> 00:35:48.445
Come on! Get up there!

00:35:48.685 --> 00:35:51.405
If that's all you got,
this army's in trouble!

00:35:51.485 --> 00:35:53.085
Get up there, Hodge!

00:35:53.365 --> 00:35:55.725
Come on! Get up there!

00:35:57.365 --> 00:35:59.845
Nobody's got that
flag in 17 years!

00:36:01.645 --> 00:36:04.805
Now fall back into line!
Come on, fall in!

00:36:04.885 --> 00:36:07.165
Let's go!
Get back into formation!

00:36:09.685 --> 00:36:11.885
Rogers! I said fall in!

00:36:28.165 --> 00:36:29.725
Thank you, sir.

00:36:38.415 --> 00:36:40.695
Faster, ladies! Come on.

00:36:40.935 --> 00:36:43.255
My grandmother has more
life in her, God rest her soul.

00:36:44.695 --> 00:36:45.735
Move it!

00:36:45.815 --> 00:36:47.975
You're not really thinking
about picking Rogers, are you?

00:36:48.015 --> 00:36:50.975
I'm more than just thinking about it.
He is the clear choice.

00:36:51.015 --> 00:36:54.375
When you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base,

00:36:54.455 --> 00:36:55.855
I let it slide.
I thought, "What the hell."

00:36:55.935 --> 00:36:57.695
Maybe he'd be useful
to you, like a gerbil.

00:36:57.735 --> 00:36:58.815
I never thought you'd pick him.

00:36:58.855 --> 00:37:00.055
Up.

00:37:02.535 --> 00:37:04.895
You stick a needle in that kid's arm,
it's gonna go right through him.

00:37:05.015 --> 00:37:07.495
- Come on, girls.
- Look at that.

00:37:08.415 --> 00:37:09.815
He's making me cry.

00:37:09.895 --> 00:37:12.495
I am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.

00:37:12.535 --> 00:37:15.215
Do you know how long it
took to set up this project?

00:37:15.255 --> 00:37:16.375
All the groveling I had to do

00:37:16.455 --> 00:37:17.655
in front of Senator
What's-His-Name's committees?

00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:19.975
Brandt. Yes, I know.
I am well aware of your efforts.

00:37:20.055 --> 00:37:23.295
Then throw me a bone.
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

00:37:23.375 --> 00:37:25.295
He's big, he's fast.
He obeys orders.

00:37:25.375 --> 00:37:26.855
- He's a soldier.
- He is a bully.

00:37:27.055 --> 00:37:29.855
You don't win wars
with niceness, Doctor.

00:37:33.135 --> 00:37:35.975
You win wars with guts.

00:37:38.055 --> 00:37:39.295
Grenade!

00:37:39.375 --> 00:37:40.695
Move, move!

00:37:43.775 --> 00:37:45.135
Get away!

00:37:45.615 --> 00:37:47.015
Get back!

00:37:54.295 --> 00:37:55.895
It was a dummy grenade.

00:37:56.935 --> 00:37:58.975
All clear. Back in formation.

00:38:03.255 --> 00:38:04.335
Is this a test?

00:38:06.095 --> 00:38:07.255
He's still skinny.

00:38:15.775 --> 00:38:17.455
- May I?
- Yeah.

00:38:20.775 --> 00:38:22.135
Can't sleep?

00:38:22.735 --> 00:38:24.575
I got the jitters, I guess.

00:38:25.095 --> 00:38:26.455
Me, too.

00:38:28.215 --> 00:38:29.775
Can I ask you a question?

00:38:29.815 --> 00:38:31.255
Just one?

00:38:33.455 --> 00:38:34.855
Why me?

00:38:37.895 --> 00:38:40.695
I suppose that is the
only question that matters.

00:38:43.895 --> 00:38:46.895
This is from Augsburg. My city.

00:38:49.575 --> 00:38:50.655
So many people forget

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:53.175
that the first country the
Nazis invaded was their own.

00:38:53.895 --> 00:38:57.335
You know, after the last war,
my people struggled.

00:38:57.415 --> 00:39:00.335
They felt weak. They felt small.

00:39:00.415 --> 00:39:02.135
And then Hitler comes
along with the marching

00:39:02.255 --> 00:39:05.295
and the big show and the flags.

00:39:06.575 --> 00:39:10.615
And he hears of me.
My work. And he finds me.

00:39:10.655 --> 00:39:11.975
And he says, "You."

00:39:12.935 --> 00:39:14.695
He says, "You will
make us strong."

00:39:15.455 --> 00:39:18.135
Well, I am not interested.

00:39:19.495 --> 00:39:21.895
So he sends the head of Hydra,

00:39:22.335 --> 00:39:24.335
his research division.

00:39:24.575 --> 00:39:27.255
A brilliant scientist by the
name of Johann Schmidt.

00:39:27.495 --> 00:39:29.975
Now, Schmidt is a
member of the inner circle.

00:39:30.015 --> 00:39:31.335
And he is ambitious.

00:39:31.775 --> 00:39:34.015
<i>He and Hitler share a passion</i>

00:39:34.055 --> 00:39:37.055
<i>for occult power
and Teutonic myth.</i>

00:39:37.815 --> 00:39:40.855
Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

00:39:40.895 --> 00:39:42.695
But for Schmidt,
it is not fantasy.

00:39:43.175 --> 00:39:46.215
For him, it is real.
He has become convinced

00:39:46.295 --> 00:39:48.855
that there is a great
power hidden in the earth,

00:39:48.895 --> 00:39:50.215
<i>left here by the gods,</i>

00:39:50.255 --> 00:39:53.095
waiting to be seized
by a superior man.

00:39:53.615 --> 00:39:57.215
So when he hears about
my formula and what it can do,

00:39:57.295 --> 00:39:58.695
he cannot resist.

00:40:01.735 --> 00:40:04.295
<i>Schmidt must become
that superior man.</i>

00:40:09.975 --> 00:40:11.095
Did it make him stronger?

00:40:11.295 --> 00:40:12.575
Yes.

00:40:12.975 --> 00:40:15.895
But there were other effects.

00:40:20.375 --> 00:40:21.535
The serum was not ready.

00:40:22.735 --> 00:40:25.735
But more important, the man.

00:40:26.655 --> 00:40:28.935
The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,

00:40:29.015 --> 00:40:32.215
so good becomes great.

00:40:32.255 --> 00:40:33.975
Bad becomes worse.

00:40:39.255 --> 00:40:40.935
This is why you were chosen.

00:40:42.015 --> 00:40:45.575
Because a strong man who
has known power all his life

00:40:45.615 --> 00:40:47.575
may lose respect for that power,

00:40:47.655 --> 00:40:50.895
but a weak man knows
the value of strength.

00:40:51.335 --> 00:40:53.255
And knows

00:40:53.775 --> 00:40:55.095
compassion.

00:40:58.255 --> 00:41:01.015
Thanks. I think.

00:41:06.935 --> 00:41:09.855
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

00:41:13.015 --> 00:41:15.175
That you will stay who you are.

00:41:17.655 --> 00:41:21.055
Not a perfect soldier, but

00:41:21.495 --> 00:41:23.495
a good man.

00:41:28.695 --> 00:41:30.175
To the little guys.

00:41:32.815 --> 00:41:34.255
No, no. Wait, wait.
What I am doing?

00:41:34.295 --> 00:41:36.455
No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.

00:41:37.735 --> 00:41:39.615
All right. We'll drink it after.

00:41:39.855 --> 00:41:41.615
No, I don't have
procedure tomorrow.

00:41:41.655 --> 00:41:43.255
Drink it after? I drink it now.

00:41:47.983 --> 00:41:50.583
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.

00:41:50.663 --> 00:41:53.783
But they will never find
you in these mountains.

00:41:55.383 --> 00:41:59.143
Look, what you just saw,

00:41:59.943 --> 00:42:02.023
that is your legacy, Stark.

00:42:03.663 --> 00:42:07.023
Your life's work, in the
hands of those murderers.

00:42:07.103 --> 00:42:09.423
Is that how you want to go out?

00:42:09.943 --> 00:42:14.903
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

00:42:15.623 --> 00:42:17.223
Or are you going to
do something about it?

00:42:17.303 --> 00:42:22.423
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

00:42:22.503 --> 00:42:25.783
And if they don't, I'll
probably be dead in a week.

00:42:25.863 --> 00:42:27.183
Well, then,

00:42:27.823 --> 00:42:30.903
this is a very important
week for you, isn't it?

00:42:31.623 --> 00:42:32.583
Hmm?

00:42:33.703 --> 00:42:35.143
If this is going to
be my work station,

00:42:35.183 --> 00:42:37.023
I want it well-lit.
I want these up.

00:42:37.463 --> 00:42:40.543
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

00:42:40.583 --> 00:42:42.783
I need a soldering station.
I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

00:42:42.863 --> 00:42:44.263
I would like a smelting cup.

00:42:44.343 --> 00:42:45.823
I need two sets
of precision tools.

00:42:59.263 --> 00:43:00.583
How many languages do you speak?

00:43:00.663 --> 00:43:01.703
A lot.

00:43:01.743 --> 00:43:04.503
But apparently, not
enough for this place.

00:43:04.543 --> 00:43:06.623
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

00:43:06.703 --> 00:43:10.103
Dari, Pashto,
Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.

00:43:11.263 --> 00:43:12.463
Who are these people?

00:43:12.543 --> 00:43:15.543
They are your
loyal customers, sir.

00:43:16.223 --> 00:43:18.263
They call themselves
the Ten Rings.

00:43:27.703 --> 00:43:29.143
You know, we might
be more productive

00:43:29.223 --> 00:43:32.023
if you include me in
the planning process.

00:43:32.183 --> 00:43:33.143
Uh-huh.

00:43:40.583 --> 00:43:42.823
Okay, we don't need this.

00:43:44.743 --> 00:43:46.263
What is that?

00:43:47.617 --> 00:43:49.977
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

00:43:50.602 --> 00:43:54.002
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

00:44:10.703 --> 00:44:13.663
Careful. Careful, we only
get one shot at this.

00:44:13.743 --> 00:44:16.463
Relax. I have steady hands.

00:44:17.423 --> 00:44:19.943
Why do you think
you're still alive? Huh?

00:44:26.223 --> 00:44:28.183
What do I call you?

00:44:28.263 --> 00:44:29.903
My name is Yinsen.

00:44:30.103 --> 00:44:32.463
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

00:44:33.343 --> 00:44:35.223
Nice to meet you, too.

00:45:15.263 --> 00:45:17.543
That doesn't look
like a Jericho missile.

00:45:17.903 --> 00:45:21.103
That's because it's a
miniaturized arc reactor.

00:45:21.423 --> 00:45:24.223
I got a big one powering
my factory at home.

00:45:24.503 --> 00:45:27.303
It should keep the
shrapnel out of my heart.

00:45:27.343 --> 00:45:29.063
But what could it generate?

00:45:29.143 --> 00:45:33.703
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

00:45:34.183 --> 00:45:36.703
That could run your
heart for 50 lifetimes.

00:45:36.743 --> 00:45:39.823
Yeah. Or something big
for 15 minutes.

00:45:48.783 --> 00:45:51.103
This is our ticket out of here.

00:45:51.183 --> 00:45:52.823
What is it?

00:45:53.663 --> 00:45:55.223
Flatten them out and look.

00:45:57.863 --> 00:45:58.863
Oh, wow.

00:46:01.903 --> 00:46:03.463
Impressive.

00:46:29.478 --> 00:46:31.358
Good.

00:46:31.438 --> 00:46:34.118
Good roll. Good roll.

00:46:34.918 --> 00:46:36.798
You still haven't told
me where you're from.

00:46:36.838 --> 00:46:39.678
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.

00:46:40.198 --> 00:46:41.678
It's actually a nice place.

00:46:42.238 --> 00:46:43.518
Got a family?

00:46:43.558 --> 00:46:47.918
Yes, and I will see
them when I leave here.

00:46:48.718 --> 00:46:50.318
And you, Stark?

00:46:54.438 --> 00:46:55.478
No.

00:46:56.038 --> 00:46:57.078
No?

00:46:58.438 --> 00:47:00.998
So you're a man
who has everything

00:47:01.678 --> 00:47:03.038
and nothing.

00:48:41.438 --> 00:48:42.638
Relax.

00:48:51.758 --> 00:48:53.958
The bow and arrow

00:48:54.038 --> 00:48:56.918
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

00:48:59.478 --> 00:49:01.878
It allowed the
great Genghis Khan

00:49:02.678 --> 00:49:05.678
to rule from the
Pacific to the Ukraine.

00:49:06.278 --> 00:49:09.998
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

00:49:11.158 --> 00:49:14.678
and four times the size
of the Roman Empire.

00:49:18.318 --> 00:49:19.638
But today,

00:49:20.478 --> 00:49:23.918
whoever holds the
latest Stark weapons

00:49:24.958 --> 00:49:26.838
rules these lands.

00:49:29.158 --> 00:49:30.478
And soon,

00:49:33.518 --> 00:49:35.198
it will be my turn.

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:27.770
What does he want?

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.690
What do you want?
A delivery date?

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:54.290
I need him.

00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:57.970
Good assistant.

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:06.810
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

00:51:49.891 --> 00:51:51.571
I know this neighborhood.

00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:54.451
I got beat up in that alley.

00:51:56.091 --> 00:51:57.131
And that parking lot.

00:51:59.411 --> 00:52:01.331
And behind that diner.

00:52:01.811 --> 00:52:04.251
Did you have something
against running away?

00:52:06.931 --> 00:52:09.451
You start running,
they'll never let you stop.

00:52:09.491 --> 00:52:11.611
You stand up, you push back.

00:52:11.651 --> 00:52:12.971
They can't say
no forever, right?

00:52:13.771 --> 00:52:15.611
I know a little of
what that's like,

00:52:15.651 --> 00:52:17.291
to have every door
shut in your face.

00:52:18.611 --> 00:52:20.451
I guess I just don't know why
you'd want to join the Army

00:52:20.531 --> 00:52:21.971
if you were a beautiful dame.

00:52:22.171 --> 00:52:23.611
Or a... A woman.

00:52:23.771 --> 00:52:25.131
An agent. Not a dame.

00:52:25.491 --> 00:52:27.091
You are beautiful, but...

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:30.091
You have no idea how to
talk to a woman, do you?

00:52:30.611 --> 00:52:32.611
I think this is the longest
conversation I've had with one.

00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:37.651
Women aren't exactly lining up to
dance with a guy they might step on.

00:52:37.971 --> 00:52:39.291
You must have danced.

00:52:39.371 --> 00:52:42.051
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

00:52:43.131 --> 00:52:45.131
And the past few years, it just

00:52:45.211 --> 00:52:48.131
didn't seem to matter that much.
I figured I'd wait.

00:52:48.491 --> 00:52:49.691
For what?

00:52:51.331 --> 00:52:52.731
The right partner.

00:53:07.251 --> 00:53:08.651
This way.

00:53:11.931 --> 00:53:14.331
- What are we doing here?
- Follow me.

00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:30.371
Wonderful weather
this morning, isn't it?

00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:32.691
Yes, but I always
carry an umbrella.

00:54:30.331 --> 00:54:31.891
Good morning.

00:54:33.091 --> 00:54:34.771
Please, not now.

00:54:39.531 --> 00:54:40.731
Are you ready?

00:54:42.771 --> 00:54:46.331
Good. Take off your shirt,
your tie, and your hat.

00:54:52.011 --> 00:54:53.691
Senator Brandt, glad
you could make it.

00:54:53.771 --> 00:54:55.411
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

00:54:55.451 --> 00:54:57.371
We needed access
to the city's power grid.

00:54:57.451 --> 00:54:59.611
Of course, if you'd given me
the generators I requisitioned...

00:54:59.651 --> 00:55:01.851
A lot of people are
asking for funds, Colonel.

00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:03.371
Oh, this is Clem, uh...

00:55:03.451 --> 00:55:05.131
Fred Clemson, State Department.

00:55:05.211 --> 00:55:06.691
If this project of yours
comes through,

00:55:06.771 --> 00:55:09.451
we'd like to see it used for
something other than headlines.

00:55:09.491 --> 00:55:13.291
Jesus. Somebody get
that kid a sandwich.

00:55:26.251 --> 00:55:27.331
Comfortable?

00:55:29.411 --> 00:55:30.611
It's a little big.

00:55:32.891 --> 00:55:34.491
You save me any
of that schnapps?

00:55:35.491 --> 00:55:38.371
Not as much as I should have.
Sorry.

00:55:38.731 --> 00:55:40.051
Next time.

00:55:41.091 --> 00:55:43.291
Mr. Stark, how are your levels?

00:55:43.331 --> 00:55:45.611
- Levels at 100%.
- Good.

00:55:45.651 --> 00:55:47.651
We may dim half
the lights in Brooklyn,

00:55:48.131 --> 00:55:50.931
but we are ready
as we'll ever be.

00:55:51.891 --> 00:55:53.011
Agent Carter?

00:55:53.051 --> 00:55:55.331
Don't you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth?

00:55:55.411 --> 00:55:57.051
Yes, of course. Sorry. Good.

00:56:09.851 --> 00:56:11.251
Do you hear me? Is this on?

00:56:12.211 --> 00:56:13.331
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:56:14.051 --> 00:56:17.531
today we take not another
step towards annihilation,

00:56:17.931 --> 00:56:19.171
<i>but the first step</i>

00:56:19.531 --> 00:56:21.571
on the path to peace.

00:56:23.851 --> 00:56:26.971
We begin with a series
of microinjections into

00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:30.851
<i>the subject's major muscle groups.
The serum infusion</i>

00:56:31.211 --> 00:56:34.051
will cause immediate
cellular change.

00:56:34.531 --> 00:56:37.531
And then, to stimulate growth,

00:56:37.691 --> 00:56:41.171
the subject will be
saturated with Vita-Rays.

00:56:48.891 --> 00:56:50.011
That wasn't so bad.

00:56:50.651 --> 00:56:51.971
That was penicillin.

00:56:55.571 --> 00:56:57.811
Serum infusion beginning in

00:56:58.171 --> 00:56:59.211
five,

00:57:00.211 --> 00:57:01.251
<i>four,</i>

00:57:02.691 --> 00:57:03.731
three,

00:57:05.091 --> 00:57:06.651
two,

00:57:08.051 --> 00:57:09.091
one.

00:57:19.611 --> 00:57:21.011
Now, Mr. Stark.

00:58:05.427 --> 00:58:07.827
Okay? Can you move?

00:58:08.307 --> 00:58:10.147
Okay, say it again.

00:58:10.227 --> 00:58:12.747
41 steps straight ahead.
Then 16 steps,

00:58:12.827 --> 00:58:16.307
that's from the door, fork
right, 33 steps, turn right.

00:58:44.138 --> 00:58:47.058
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

00:58:47.538 --> 00:58:49.178
Say something.
Say something back to him.

00:58:49.258 --> 00:58:51.658
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

00:58:51.698 --> 00:58:52.938
Okay. I know.

00:58:52.978 --> 00:58:54.178
What do you know?

00:59:17.498 --> 00:59:19.618
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

00:59:20.018 --> 00:59:21.698
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

00:59:21.738 --> 00:59:24.338
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

00:59:24.738 --> 00:59:25.738
Okay.

00:59:26.818 --> 00:59:28.018
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

00:59:28.098 --> 00:59:29.858
Function 11.

00:59:29.978 --> 00:59:31.698
Tell me when you
see a progress bar.

00:59:32.098 --> 00:59:33.378
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

00:59:33.458 --> 00:59:34.578
Talk to me.
Tell me when you see it.

00:59:34.658 --> 00:59:36.178
- I have it.
- Press Control "I."

00:59:36.298 --> 00:59:38.698
- Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "I" and "Enter."

00:59:38.778 --> 00:59:40.538
Come over here and button me up.

00:59:43.578 --> 00:59:44.738
Okay. All right.

00:59:44.818 --> 00:59:46.178
Every other hex bolt.

00:59:46.218 --> 00:59:48.378
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:49.818
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

00:59:52.258 --> 00:59:54.538
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

00:59:54.618 --> 00:59:56.378
We need more time.

00:59:57.538 --> 00:59:58.538
Hey,

00:59:59.378 --> 01:00:00.898
I'm gonna go buy you some time.

01:00:00.938 --> 01:00:02.578
Stick to the plan!

01:00:03.378 --> 01:00:04.778
Stick to the plan!

01:00:06.738 --> 01:00:07.938
Yinsen!

01:00:35.462 --> 01:00:38.462
Steven? Can you hear me?

01:00:38.822 --> 01:00:41.982
It's probably too late to
go to the bathroom, right?

01:00:43.422 --> 01:00:45.182
We will proceed.

01:00:57.662 --> 01:00:58.702
That's 10%.

01:00:59.862 --> 01:01:00.862
Twenty percent.

01:01:01.222 --> 01:01:02.382
Thirty.

01:01:05.022 --> 01:01:06.102
<i>That's 40%.</i>

01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:08.622
Vital signs are normal.

01:01:08.822 --> 01:01:09.862
That's 50%.

01:01:10.622 --> 01:01:11.662
Sixty.

01:01:13.342 --> 01:01:14.622
Seventy.

01:01:19.182 --> 01:01:20.222
Steven!

01:01:20.822 --> 01:01:22.742
Steven! Shut it down!

01:01:24.022 --> 01:01:25.102
Shut it down!

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:26.942
Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark!

01:01:27.182 --> 01:01:28.742
Turn it off! Kill it!
Kill the reactor!

01:01:28.822 --> 01:01:30.182
No!

01:01:30.542 --> 01:01:33.182
Don't! I can do this!

01:01:40.062 --> 01:01:41.142
Eighty.

01:01:41.742 --> 01:01:42.782
Ninety.

01:01:44.222 --> 01:01:46.222
That's 100%.

01:04:33.271 --> 01:04:34.511
Yinsen!

01:04:34.551 --> 01:04:35.711
Watch out!

01:04:50.831 --> 01:04:51.991
Stark.

01:04:53.271 --> 01:04:55.391
Come on. We got to go.

01:04:56.111 --> 01:04:59.031
Move for me, come on.
We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it.

01:04:59.071 --> 01:05:01.031
This was always the plan, Stark.

01:05:01.511 --> 01:05:03.631
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

01:05:05.111 --> 01:05:07.071
My family is dead.

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:10.151
I'm going to see
them now, Stark.

01:05:12.591 --> 01:05:14.071
It's okay.

01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:19.111
I want this. I want this.

01:05:25.111 --> 01:05:27.071
Thank you for saving me.

01:05:28.511 --> 01:05:32.511
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:12.591
My turn.

01:07:56.111 --> 01:07:57.191
Not bad.

01:08:29.111 --> 01:08:30.471
Hey!

01:08:53.071 --> 01:08:54.991
How was the "fun-vee"?

01:08:57.271 --> 01:08:59.671
Next time, you
ride with me, okay?

01:09:30.711 --> 01:09:32.511
Watch it, coming up here.

01:09:34.471 --> 01:09:37.631
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

01:09:42.791 --> 01:09:43.791
Hmm.

01:09:45.871 --> 01:09:49.231
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

01:09:49.311 --> 01:09:51.791
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.

01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:53.871
Yeah, vacation's over.

01:09:55.671 --> 01:09:56.791
Where to, sir?

01:09:56.871 --> 01:09:58.511
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

01:09:58.551 --> 01:09:59.671
No? Tony, you have to

01:09:59.711 --> 01:10:00.751
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

01:10:00.831 --> 01:10:02.591
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

01:10:02.671 --> 01:10:04.351
I've been in captivity
for three months.

01:10:04.391 --> 01:10:08.191
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

01:10:08.231 --> 01:10:09.231
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

01:10:09.311 --> 01:10:11.711
...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:13.071
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

01:10:13.111 --> 01:10:15.671
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

01:10:28.151 --> 01:10:29.911
Look at this!

01:10:31.751 --> 01:10:32.951
Tony.

01:10:35.351 --> 01:10:36.671
We were going to
meet at the hospital.

01:10:36.751 --> 01:10:38.191
No, I'm fine.

01:10:38.271 --> 01:10:39.631
Look at you!

01:10:40.431 --> 01:10:42.791
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:44.031
You get me one of those?

01:10:44.111 --> 01:10:45.351
There's only one left.
I need it.

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:51.111
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

01:10:56.471 --> 01:10:57.991
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

01:10:58.071 --> 01:10:59.311
Can I speak to you for a moment?

01:10:59.391 --> 01:11:01.551
I'm not part of the
press conference,

01:11:01.631 --> 01:11:03.031
but it's about to
begin right now.

01:11:03.111 --> 01:11:04.431
I'm not a reporter.

01:11:04.471 --> 01:11:05.951
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:07.791
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:09.471
and Logistics Division.

01:11:09.551 --> 01:11:10.791
That's quite a mouthful.

01:11:10.831 --> 01:11:12.271
I know. We're working on it.

01:11:12.311 --> 01:11:16.791
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

01:11:16.871 --> 01:11:20.551
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

01:11:20.631 --> 01:11:24.311
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.

01:11:24.391 --> 01:11:25.911
I'll put something
in the book, shall I?

01:11:25.951 --> 01:11:27.551
Thank you.

01:11:29.311 --> 01:11:30.671
Uh...

01:11:32.471 --> 01:11:35.071
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

01:11:35.151 --> 01:11:38.551
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

01:11:38.751 --> 01:11:40.831
A little less formal and...

01:11:45.671 --> 01:11:47.231
What's up with the love-in?

01:11:47.311 --> 01:11:48.391
Don't look at me.

01:11:48.511 --> 01:11:50.551
I don't know what he's up to.

01:11:50.631 --> 01:11:51.751
Good to see you.

01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:53.031
Good to see you.

01:11:53.111 --> 01:11:55.551
I never got to say
goodbye to Dad.

01:11:55.791 --> 01:11:58.511
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:03.631
There's questions that
I would have asked him.

01:12:03.671 --> 01:12:06.751
I would have asked him how he
felt about what this company did.

01:12:08.231 --> 01:12:11.151
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

01:12:12.031 --> 01:12:16.351
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:22.831
I saw young Americans killed

01:12:23.711 --> 01:12:27.711
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

01:12:29.151 --> 01:12:30.511
And I saw

01:12:31.711 --> 01:12:35.311
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

01:12:36.631 --> 01:12:38.591
- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

01:12:39.311 --> 01:12:40.591
What happened over there?

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:45.871
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

01:12:45.911 --> 01:12:50.351
to offer this world than just
making things that blow up.

01:12:50.391 --> 01:12:53.871
And that is why, effective
immediately, I am shutting down

01:12:53.951 --> 01:12:57.631
the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International

01:12:57.711 --> 01:13:01.711
until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.

01:13:01.831 --> 01:13:03.391
I think we're gonna be
selling a lot of newspapers.

01:13:03.431 --> 01:13:05.231
What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

01:13:05.271 --> 01:13:09.351
and is consistent with the highest
good for this country, as well.

01:13:10.711 --> 01:13:15.511
What we should take away
from this is that Tony's back!

01:13:15.911 --> 01:13:18.231
And he's healthier than ever.

01:13:18.631 --> 01:13:21.751
<i>We're going to have a
little internal discussion...</i>

01:13:38.185 --> 01:13:40.145
Mr. Stark?

01:13:51.212 --> 01:13:53.132
Steven. Steven.

01:13:55.938 --> 01:13:57.298
The son of a bitch did it.

01:14:03.371 --> 01:14:04.731
- I did it.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:14:05.606 --> 01:14:06.726
I think we did it.

01:14:06.791 --> 01:14:08.031
You actually did it.

01:14:11.811 --> 01:14:13.451
How do you feel?

01:14:16.431 --> 01:14:18.031
Taller.

01:14:20.983 --> 01:14:22.343
You look taller.

01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:24.224
How do you like
Brooklyn now, Senator?

01:14:24.632 --> 01:14:28.552
I can think of some folks in Berlin
who are about to get very nervous.

01:14:30.891 --> 01:14:33.051
Congratulations, Doctor.

01:14:33.171 --> 01:14:34.851
Thank you, sir.
