00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.220
<i>You want to know what went wrong.</i>

00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:03.998
Fury says to me once,

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:08.348
"In the time of gods and monsters,
what is the worth of a man?"

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.504
I don't know what he means.

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:18.132
And then men are dying all round.

00:01:19.632 --> 00:01:22.232
Good men.
Friends.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.669
Even some heroes.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.904
<i>So it's safe to say mistakes were
made in the handling of the incident?</i>

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:33.489
Mistakes?

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:37.875
We're at war,
and he thinks about superheroes.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.510
<i>The Avengers?</i>

00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:42.621
<i>You thought they were a threat.</i>

00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:45.171
I thought they were a joke.

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:51.880
Nick Fury only ever saw them as
the Avengers, no matter what he said.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.517
<i>It was absolutely a bad idea.</i>

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:02.442
<i>The wrong people at the wrong time,
and it worked.</i>

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:09.629
<i>They came together, and they saved us,
and it's infuriating.</i>

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.580
<i>We're trained to believe in a system,
not to gamble. Not to hope.</i>

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:24.233
<i>Nick Fury saw something
running under the system.</i>

00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:26.761
<i>A current, a connection, a truth...</i>

00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:33.661
<i>about what we can do,
what they would become.</i>

00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:42.411
Captain America saved my life.

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.899
<i>The Avengers were the mistake
that saved the world.</i>

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.999
That's my official statement.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.179
<i>Tony Stark.</i>

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.139
<i>Visionary. Genius.</i>

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.659
<i>American patriot.</i>

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.099
<i>Even from an early age,</i>

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.659
<i>the son of legendary weapons
developer Howard Stark</i>

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:47.299
<i>quickly stole the spotlight with
his brilliant and unique mind.</i>

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:50.819
<i>At age four, he built
his first circuit board.</i>

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.019
<i>At age six, his first engine.</i>

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.539
<i>And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.</i>

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:00.899
<i>Then, the passing of a titan.</i>

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:05.419
<i>Howard Stark's lifelong
friend and ally, Obadiah Stane,</i>

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.939
<i>steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,</i>

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.459
<i>until, at age 21,
the prodigal son returns</i>

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.939
<i>and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.</i>

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.339
<i>With the keys to the kingdom,</i>

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.219
<i>Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,</i>

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.339
<i>creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.</i>

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:28.339
<i>Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry</i>

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:31.219
<i>by ensuring freedom
and protecting America</i>

00:04:31.299 --> 00:04:33.859
<i>and her interests
around the globe.</i>

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.539
As liaison to Stark Industries,

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.899
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.739
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:55.379
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:59.779
to present this year's Apogee
Award to Mr. Tony Stark.

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:08.339
Tony?

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:23.219
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.979
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:28.499
This is wonderful.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.379
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:39.379
But if I were Tony, I would
tell you how honored I feel

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:44.419
and what a joy it is to receive
this very prestigious award.

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:46.299
Tony, you know...

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.339
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:51.779
He's always working.

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.299
Work it! Come on!

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:02.339
We should just
stay till the morning.

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.419
You are unbelievable.

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:06.139
Oh, no! Did they
rope you into this?

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:07.779
Nobody roped me into anything!

00:06:07.859 --> 00:06:08.915
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:11.779
if I presented you with an
award, you'd be deeply honored.

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:13.835
Of course I'd be deeply
honored. And it's you, that's great.

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:15.579
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:17.819
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:19.259
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:21.659
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:23.355
I don't have any of those
floating around.

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:25.459
We're gonna let it ride!

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.795
Give me a hand, will you? Give
me a little something-something.

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:29.939
Okay, you, too.

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.939
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.499
There it is. Lieutenant
Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:35.819
Two craps.
Line away.

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:37.779
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:39.755
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:40.835
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:41.859
Tomorrow, don't be late.

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.275
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:44.579
I know, I know.

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.179
Render unto Caesar that
which is Caesar's. There you go.

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:54.859
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:57.459
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:58.658
Can I ask you
a couple of questions?

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:00.179
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:01.339
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.339
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.259
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:08.179
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:09.915
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:11.139
"The Merchant of Death"?

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:12.739
That's not bad.

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:15.579
Let me guess. Berkeley?

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:16.819
Brown, actually.

00:07:16.859 --> 00:07:19.299
Well, Ms. Brown,

00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:21.835
it's an imperfect world, but
it's the only one we've got.

00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:24.675
I guarantee you, the day weapons
are no longer needed to keep the peace,

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:26.859
I'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.059
Rehearse that much?

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:29.835
Every night in front of
the mirror before bedtime.

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:30.898
I can see that.

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:32.219
I'd like to show you first-hand.

00:07:32.299 --> 00:07:34.539
All I want is a serious answer.

00:07:34.619 --> 00:07:36.899
Okay, here's serious. My
old man had a philosophy,

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:39.379
"Peace means having a
bigger stick than the other guy."

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.739
That's a great line coming
from the guy selling the sticks.

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:43.139
My father helped
defeat the Nazis.

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:44.619
He worked on
the Manhattan Project.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.259
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:48.579
would call that being a hero.

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:50.875
And a lot of people would
also call that war profiteering.

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:53.075
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:54.899
by advancing medical technology

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:57.339
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:00.659
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:04.179
You ever lose an hour
of sleep your whole life?

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:06.139
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.

00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:20.366
<i>War continues to ravage Europe.</i>

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:23.486
<i>But help is on the way.</i>

00:08:24.246 --> 00:08:28.926
<i>Every able-bodied young man
is lining up to serve his country.</i>

00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:34.486
<i>Even little Timmy is
doing his part</i>

00:08:34.606 --> 00:08:36.606
<i>collecting scrap metal.</i>

00:08:36.806 --> 00:08:37.846
<i>Nice work, Timmy!</i>

00:08:37.926 --> 00:08:39.206
Who cares?

00:08:40.326 --> 00:08:41.966
Play the movie already!

00:08:42.046 --> 00:08:43.766
Hey, you wanna show
some respect?

00:08:44.006 --> 00:08:45.286
<i>Meanwhile, overseas,</i>

00:08:45.326 --> 00:08:48.446
<i>our brave boys are showing</i>
<i>the Axis powers that the price</i>

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:50.286
<i>of freedom is never too high.</i>

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:52.646
Let's go! Get on with it!

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.566
- Hey, just start the cartoon!
- Hey, you wanna shut up?

00:08:57.446 --> 00:09:00.126
<i>Together with Allied
forces, we'll face any threat,</i>

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.566
<i>no matter the size.</i>

00:09:18.966 --> 00:09:20.806
You just don't know
when to give up, do you?

00:09:21.486 --> 00:09:23.186
I can do this all day.

00:09:23.503 --> 00:09:25.543
<i>Kaminsky, Henry.</i>

00:09:25.823 --> 00:09:27.863
Boy, a lot of guys
getting killed over there.

00:09:28.183 --> 00:09:29.823
<i>Rogers, Steven.</i>

00:09:30.823 --> 00:09:33.663
It kind of makes you think
twice about enlisting, huh?

00:09:34.183 --> 00:09:35.343
Nope.

00:09:38.303 --> 00:09:39.823
Rogers.

00:09:46.023 --> 00:09:48.663
What did your father
die of? Mustard gas.

00:09:49.503 --> 00:09:50.903
He was in the 107th Infantry.

00:09:50.983 --> 00:09:52.703
I was hoping I
could be assigned...

00:09:52.743 --> 00:09:55.503
Your mother? She was
a nurse in a TB ward.

00:09:55.663 --> 00:09:57.703
Got hit. Couldn't shake it.

00:10:02.223 --> 00:10:04.303
Sorry, son. Look,
just give me a chance.

00:10:04.383 --> 00:10:06.943
You'd be ineligible
on your asthma alone.

00:10:07.383 --> 00:10:08.463
Is there anything you can do?

00:10:08.903 --> 00:10:10.263
I'm doing it.

00:10:10.663 --> 00:10:11.983
I'm saving your life.

00:10:18.474 --> 00:10:19.754
Hey!

00:10:19.794 --> 00:10:21.314
Pick on someone your own size.

00:10:29.514 --> 00:10:32.514
Sometimes I think you
like getting punched.

00:10:33.194 --> 00:10:34.874
I had him on the ropes.

00:10:35.714 --> 00:10:37.114
How many times is this?

00:10:38.274 --> 00:10:40.474
Oh, you're from Paramus now?

00:10:40.714 --> 00:10:43.474
You know it's illegal to
lie on the enlistment form.

00:10:43.554 --> 00:10:45.034
And seriously, Jersey?

00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:48.314
You get your orders?

00:10:50.834 --> 00:10:51.954
The 107th.

00:10:52.314 --> 00:10:53.754
Sergeant James Barnes,

00:10:53.794 --> 00:10:56.234
shipping out for England
first thing tomorrow.

00:10:59.594 --> 00:11:01.234
I should be going.

00:11:04.794 --> 00:11:05.834
Come on, man.

00:11:06.554 --> 00:11:09.474
My last night! I got
to get you cleaned up.

00:11:09.554 --> 00:11:11.154
Why? Where are we going?

00:11:11.234 --> 00:11:12.554
The future.

00:11:15.774 --> 00:11:17.510
<i>Good morning.
It's 7:00 a.m.</i>

00:11:17.534 --> 00:11:21.214
<i>The weather in Malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.</i>

00:11:21.374 --> 00:11:24.694
<i>The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.</i>

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:27.214
<i>High tide will
be at 10:52 a.m.</i>

00:11:44.214 --> 00:11:45.574
Tony?

00:11:46.934 --> 00:11:48.334
Hey, Tony?

00:12:10.534 --> 00:12:12.470
You are not authorized
to access this area.

00:12:12.494 --> 00:12:15.214
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:18.334
I've got your clothes here. They've
been dry-cleaned and pressed,

00:12:18.414 --> 00:12:20.174
and there's a car
waiting for you outside

00:12:20.254 --> 00:12:22.574
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

00:12:22.894 --> 00:12:25.374
You must be the
famous Pepper Potts.

00:12:25.454 --> 00:12:27.134
Indeed I am.

00:12:27.934 --> 00:12:31.894
After all these years, Tony still
has you picking up the dry-cleaning.

00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:35.334
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

00:12:35.414 --> 00:12:38.214
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

00:12:38.294 --> 00:12:39.374
Will that be all?

00:12:40.574 --> 00:12:41.670
Sometimes I try to do things

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:44.014
but it just doesn't work out
the way I want it to,

00:12:44.134 --> 00:12:46.294
and I get real frustrated

00:12:46.334 --> 00:12:48.334
and then, like,
I try hard to do it

00:12:48.414 --> 00:12:49.734
and I, like, take my time

00:12:49.774 --> 00:12:51.590
but it just doesn't work out
the way I want it to.

00:12:51.614 --> 00:12:53.774
It's like I concentrate
on it real hard

00:12:53.854 --> 00:12:56.254
but it just doesn't work out.

00:12:56.294 --> 00:12:57.934
Give me an exploded view.

00:12:57.974 --> 00:13:01.254
The compression in
cylinder three appears to be low.

00:13:01.654 --> 00:13:02.894
Log that.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:07.710
I'm gonna try again, right now.

00:13:07.734 --> 00:13:08.790
Please don't turn down my music.

00:13:08.814 --> 00:13:09.814
I'll keep you posted.

00:13:09.894 --> 00:13:11.710
You are supposed to be halfway
around the world right now.

00:13:11.734 --> 00:13:12.814
How'd she take it?

00:13:12.974 --> 00:13:14.094
Like a champ.

00:13:14.334 --> 00:13:15.790
Why are you trying to
hustle me out of here?

00:13:15.814 --> 00:13:17.590
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.

00:13:17.614 --> 00:13:19.774
That's funny, I thought with
it being my plane and all,

00:13:19.814 --> 00:13:21.430
that it would just wait
for me to get there.

00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:23.270
Tony, I need to speak to
you about a couple things

00:13:23.294 --> 00:13:24.430
before I get you
out of the door.

00:13:24.454 --> 00:13:26.750
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

00:13:26.774 --> 00:13:28.054
if it departs before you arrive?

00:13:28.094 --> 00:13:31.454
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

00:13:31.494 --> 00:13:33.174
Do you want it?
Yes or no.

00:13:33.214 --> 00:13:35.334
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

00:13:36.134 --> 00:13:38.614
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

00:13:38.654 --> 00:13:39.974
where he lived and worked,

00:13:40.014 --> 00:13:41.534
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

00:13:41.614 --> 00:13:43.734
I think it's a fair example.

00:13:43.854 --> 00:13:46.014
I think it's
incredibly overpriced.

00:13:46.854 --> 00:13:49.454
I need it.
Buy it. Store it.

00:13:50.174 --> 00:13:52.814
Okay. The MIT
commencement speech...

00:13:52.854 --> 00:13:55.750
Is in June. Please, don't harangue
me about stuff that's way, way, down...

00:13:55.774 --> 00:13:58.174
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

00:13:58.294 --> 00:13:59.830
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

00:13:59.854 --> 00:14:01.270
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

00:14:01.294 --> 00:14:03.270
What are you trying to get rid
of me for? What, you got plans?

00:14:03.294 --> 00:14:04.374
As a matter of fact, I do.

00:14:04.454 --> 00:14:05.830
I don't like it
when you have plans.

00:14:05.854 --> 00:14:07.934
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.534
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

00:14:09.614 --> 00:14:11.094
I knew that. Already?

00:14:11.174 --> 00:14:14.694
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

00:14:15.614 --> 00:14:16.990
Get yourself
something nice from me.

00:14:17.014 --> 00:14:18.214
I already did.

00:14:18.294 --> 00:14:19.294
And?

00:14:19.374 --> 00:14:20.854
Oh, it was very nice.

00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:24.214
- Yeah?
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

00:14:24.974 --> 00:14:27.054
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

00:14:30.214 --> 00:14:31.214
Okay.

00:14:49.654 --> 00:14:53.254
You're good. Oh, I thought
I lost you back there.

00:14:53.854 --> 00:14:57.774
You did, sir. I had to
cut across Mulholland.

00:14:58.134 --> 00:14:59.454
I got you.
I got you.

00:14:59.534 --> 00:15:00.974
What's wrong with you?

00:15:01.054 --> 00:15:02.574
- What?
- Three hours.

00:15:02.654 --> 00:15:04.814
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

00:15:04.894 --> 00:15:06.910
For three hours. For three
hours you got me standing here.

00:15:06.934 --> 00:15:09.454
Waiting on you now.
Let's go. Come on.

00:15:10.094 --> 00:15:12.094
Wheels up!
Rock and roll!

00:15:20.134 --> 00:15:22.774
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

00:15:22.814 --> 00:15:25.054
Come on, sour patch.
Don't be mad.

00:15:25.134 --> 00:15:27.854
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

00:15:27.934 --> 00:15:29.430
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

00:15:29.454 --> 00:15:30.670
You don't need to apologize
to me. I'm your man.

00:15:30.694 --> 00:15:31.750
Hi. I told him
I was sorry, but he...

00:15:31.774 --> 00:15:33.270
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

00:15:33.294 --> 00:15:34.494
You don't respect yourself,

00:15:34.574 --> 00:15:35.990
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

00:15:36.014 --> 00:15:37.374
I'm just your babysitter.

00:15:37.454 --> 00:15:39.974
So, when you need your
diaper changed... Thank you.

00:15:40.054 --> 00:15:42.214
Let me know and
I'll get you a bottle, okay?

00:15:42.294 --> 00:15:43.974
Hey! Heat up the sake,
will you?

00:15:44.054 --> 00:15:45.470
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

00:15:45.494 --> 00:15:47.294
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

00:15:47.334 --> 00:15:49.814
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

00:15:49.854 --> 00:15:51.454
incapable of being responsible.

00:15:51.574 --> 00:15:52.990
It would be
irresponsible not to drink.

00:15:53.014 --> 00:15:54.110
I'm just talking
about a nightcap.

00:15:54.134 --> 00:15:55.214
Hot sake?

00:15:55.294 --> 00:15:56.334
- Yes, two, please.
- No.

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:58.654
I'm not drinking.
I don't want any.

00:15:58.694 --> 00:16:00.054
That's what I'm talking about.

00:16:00.134 --> 00:16:03.214
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

00:16:03.294 --> 00:16:05.014
you know what I recognize?

00:16:05.094 --> 00:16:10.374
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

00:16:10.454 --> 00:16:13.174
Hey, you know what? I'm
not like you. I'm not cut out...

00:16:13.214 --> 00:16:14.734
No, no. You don't
have to be like me!

00:16:14.814 --> 00:16:16.334
But you're more
than what you are.

00:16:16.374 --> 00:16:18.254
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

00:16:18.334 --> 00:16:21.374
No! You can't be distracted
right now! Listen to me!

00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:26.581
I don't see what the problem is.

00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:29.221
You're about to be the last
eligible man in New York.

00:16:29.461 --> 00:16:31.861
You know there's three and
a half million women here?

00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:33.181
Well, I'd settle for just one.

00:16:34.141 --> 00:16:35.621
Good thing I took care of that.

00:16:36.221 --> 00:16:37.301
Hey, Bucky!

00:16:39.621 --> 00:16:41.741
What'd you tell her about me?

00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.781
Only the good stuff.

00:16:44.941 --> 00:16:48.101
<i>Welcome to the
Modern Marvels Pavilion</i>

00:16:48.141 --> 00:16:50.781
<i>and the World of Tomorrow.</i>

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:55.101
<i>A greater world. A better world.</i>

00:16:58.341 --> 00:17:00.941
- Oh, my God!
- It's starting!

00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:15.201
<i>I love you, Howard!</i>

00:17:17.441 --> 00:17:19.361
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:24.321
what if I told you that in just a
few short years, your automobile

00:17:24.561 --> 00:17:27.481
won't even have to
touch the ground at all?

00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:31.641
Yes. Thanks, Mandy.

00:17:31.681 --> 00:17:34.001
With Stark Gravitic
Reversion Technology

00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:36.321
you'll be able to do just that.

00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:45.921
Holy cow.

00:17:58.281 --> 00:18:00.361
I did say a few years, didn't I?

00:18:06.138 --> 00:18:09.498
Hey, Steve, what do you
say we treat these girls...

00:18:09.738 --> 00:18:12.338
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
  Mr. Howard Stark!</i>

00:18:13.904 --> 00:18:15.424
<i>- Tony!
- Mr. Stark!</i>

00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:22.119
General.

00:18:22.199 --> 00:18:25.799
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look
forward to your weapons presentation.

00:18:25.879 --> 00:18:26.919
Thanks.

00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:31.679
Is it better to be
feared or respected?

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:34.919
I say, is it too
much to ask for both?

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:38.759
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel

00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:40.639
of Stark Industries'
Freedom Line.

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:41.815
It's the first missile system

00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:44.719
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

00:18:44.759 --> 00:18:48.759
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:50.839
I respectfully disagree.

00:18:50.919 --> 00:18:54.959
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:58.399
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:01.279
And it's worked out
pretty well so far.

00:19:01.399 --> 00:19:02.759
Find an excuse

00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:06.119
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

00:19:06.199 --> 00:19:09.759
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

00:19:28.239 --> 00:19:31.999
For your consideration,
the Jericho.

00:19:43.639 --> 00:19:44.655
I'll be throwing one of these in

00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:46.719
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:47.839
To peace!

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:51.639
- <i>Tony.</i>
- Obie, what are you doing up?

00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:54.199
<i>I couldn't sleep till I found
out how it went. How'd it go?</i>

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:56.175
It went great. Looks like it's
gonna be an early Christmas.

00:19:56.199 --> 00:20:00.039
<i>Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?</i>

00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:01.655
Why aren't you wearing
those pajamas I got you?

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:03.279
<i>Good night, Tony.</i>

00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:07.159
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

00:20:07.199 --> 00:20:09.199
The "hum-drum-vee"
is back there.

00:20:09.239 --> 00:20:10.599
Nice job.

00:20:10.679 --> 00:20:11.999
See you back at base.

00:20:39.877 --> 00:20:41.533
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

00:20:41.557 --> 00:20:43.597
This is crazy.
What did I do?

00:20:43.637 --> 00:20:45.173
I feel like you're going
to pull over and snuff me.

00:20:45.197 --> 00:20:47.637
What, you're not allowed
to talk? Hey, Forrest!

00:20:47.677 --> 00:20:48.917
We can talk, sir.

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:51.437
Oh, I see.
So it's personal?

00:20:51.477 --> 00:20:52.797
No, you intimidate them.

00:20:52.837 --> 00:20:54.357
Good God, you're a woman.

00:20:54.437 --> 00:20:56.077
I honestly...
I couldn't have called that.

00:20:56.157 --> 00:20:58.613
I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?

00:20:58.637 --> 00:21:00.077
I thought of you
as a soldier first.

00:21:00.157 --> 00:21:01.477
I'm an airman.

00:21:01.517 --> 00:21:03.333
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

00:21:03.357 --> 00:21:06.157
I'm kind of having a hard
time not looking at you now.

00:21:06.237 --> 00:21:08.997
Is that weird?
Come on, it's okay, laugh.

00:21:09.437 --> 00:21:10.837
Sir, I have a question to ask.

00:21:10.917 --> 00:21:11.957
Yes, please.

00:21:11.997 --> 00:21:15.717
Is it true you went 12 for 12 with
last year's Maxim cover models?

00:21:15.797 --> 00:21:17.957
That is an excellent
question. Yes and no.

00:21:17.997 --> 00:21:19.517
March and I had
a scheduling conflict,

00:21:19.557 --> 00:21:22.517
but fortunately, the
Christmas cover was twins.

00:21:22.557 --> 00:21:25.477
Anything else? You're kidding
me with the hand up, right?

00:21:25.517 --> 00:21:27.317
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?

00:21:27.357 --> 00:21:29.237
Yes. It's very cool.

00:21:33.037 --> 00:21:34.357
All right.

00:21:34.397 --> 00:21:36.517
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:38.197
Please, no gang signs.

00:21:38.277 --> 00:21:39.837
No, throw it up.
I'm kidding.

00:21:39.957 --> 00:21:41.677
Yeah, peace.
I love peace.

00:21:41.757 --> 00:21:43.037
I'd be out of a job with peace.

00:21:43.117 --> 00:21:46.957
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

00:21:52.717 --> 00:21:54.757
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

00:21:54.837 --> 00:21:56.557
What have we got?

00:21:57.797 --> 00:21:59.877
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

00:21:59.917 --> 00:22:01.477
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

00:22:07.357 --> 00:22:08.877
Son of a bitch!

00:22:10.517 --> 00:22:11.877
Wait, wait, wait!
Give me a gun!

00:22:11.917 --> 00:22:13.317
Stay here!

00:22:42.597 --> 00:22:43.917
Whoa!

00:23:36.718 --> 00:23:38.518
Come on, soldier.

00:23:43.478 --> 00:23:45.638
Come on. You're kind of
missing the point of a double date.

00:23:45.678 --> 00:23:47.158
We're taking the girls dancing.

00:23:47.238 --> 00:23:49.358
You go ahead. I'll
catch up with you.

00:23:52.278 --> 00:23:54.278
You're really going
to do this again?

00:23:54.358 --> 00:23:55.878
Well, it's a fair. I'm
gonna try my luck.

00:23:55.958 --> 00:23:57.678
As who, Steve from Ohio?

00:23:57.758 --> 00:24:00.158
They'll catch you. Or worse,
they'll actually take you.

00:24:00.798 --> 00:24:02.158
Look, I know you
don't think I can do this.

00:24:02.198 --> 00:24:03.598
This isn't a back
alley, Steve. It's war.

00:24:03.678 --> 00:24:05.678
- I know it's a war.
- Why are you so keen to fight?

00:24:05.718 --> 00:24:07.598
- There are so many important jobs.
- What do you want me to do?

00:24:07.678 --> 00:24:09.638
Collect scrap metal
in my little red wagon?

00:24:09.678 --> 00:24:11.358
- Yes. Why not?
- I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.

00:24:11.398 --> 00:24:14.038
Bucky, come on. There are
men laying down their lives.

00:24:14.998 --> 00:24:17.158
I got no right to do
any less than them.

00:24:17.198 --> 00:24:19.878
That's what you don't
understand. This isn't about me.

00:24:20.318 --> 00:24:23.478
Right. 'Cause you
got nothing to prove.

00:24:26.318 --> 00:24:29.198
Hey, Sarge! Are
we going dancing?

00:24:30.438 --> 00:24:32.198
Yes, we are.

00:24:38.038 --> 00:24:40.318
Don't do anything
stupid until I get back.

00:24:40.398 --> 00:24:41.438
How can I?

00:24:41.838 --> 00:24:43.718
You're taking all
the stupid with you.

00:24:46.398 --> 00:24:49.078
You're a punk. Jerk.

00:24:49.798 --> 00:24:51.558
Be careful.

00:24:54.918 --> 00:24:56.398
Don't win the
war till I get there!

00:25:01.558 --> 00:25:04.518
Come on, girls.
They're playing our song.

00:25:24.038 --> 00:25:25.278
Wait here.

00:25:26.278 --> 00:25:28.718
- Is there a problem?
- Just wait here.

00:25:47.638 --> 00:25:48.958
Thank you.

00:25:52.798 --> 00:25:53.878
So,

00:25:54.598 --> 00:25:58.038
you want to go
overseas. Kill some Nazis.

00:25:59.398 --> 00:26:00.718
Excuse me?

00:26:01.038 --> 00:26:02.678
Dr. Abraham Erskine.

00:26:02.758 --> 00:26:05.478
I represent the Strategic
Scientific Reserve.

00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:06.918
Steve Rogers.

00:26:11.398 --> 00:26:12.998
Where are you from?

00:26:13.398 --> 00:26:17.558
Queens. 73rd Street
and Utopia Parkway.

00:26:17.998 --> 00:26:19.998
Before that, Germany.

00:26:20.998 --> 00:26:22.918
This troubles you? No.

00:26:23.878 --> 00:26:26.038
Where are you from,
Mr. Rogers? Hmm?

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:28.078
Is it New Haven?

00:26:29.158 --> 00:26:30.598
Or Paramus?

00:26:31.598 --> 00:26:33.838
Five exams in
five different cities.

00:26:33.918 --> 00:26:34.998
That might not
be the right file.

00:26:35.038 --> 00:26:36.918
No, it's not the exams
I'm interested in.

00:26:36.998 --> 00:26:39.158
It's the five tries.

00:26:40.198 --> 00:26:42.918
But you didn't
answer my question.

00:26:42.998 --> 00:26:44.358
Do you want to kill Nazis?

00:26:47.318 --> 00:26:48.358
Is this a test?

00:26:49.678 --> 00:26:51.038
Yes.

00:26:54.118 --> 00:26:55.798
I don't want to kill anyone.

00:26:56.518 --> 00:26:59.638
I don't like bullies. I don't
care where they're from.

00:27:01.358 --> 00:27:02.678
Well, there are already

00:27:02.718 --> 00:27:04.718
so many big men
fighting this war.

00:27:04.918 --> 00:27:07.238
Maybe what we need
now is a little guy, huh?

00:27:09.118 --> 00:27:10.598
I can offer you a chance.

00:27:11.958 --> 00:27:13.878
Only a chance.

00:27:13.918 --> 00:27:15.718
- I'll take it.
- Good.

00:27:16.878 --> 00:27:20.718
So where is the little
guy from? Actually?

00:27:21.718 --> 00:27:23.038
Brooklyn.

00:27:25.238 --> 00:27:27.718
Congratulations, soldier.

00:28:41.692 --> 00:28:43.852
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.400
Recruits, attention!

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.960
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.920
I supervise all
operations for this division.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.160
What's with the
accent, Queen Victoria?

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.320
I thought I was signing
up for the U.S. Army.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.560
What's your name, soldier?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.720
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.520
Step forward, Hodge.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.640
Put your right foot forward.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.440
Mmm... We gonna wrassle?

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.600
'Cause I got a few
moves I know you'll like.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.760
Agent Carter!

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.480
Colonel Phillips.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.560
I can see that you are breaking
in the candidates. That's good!

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.560
Get your ass up out of that dirt

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.960
and stand in that
line at attention

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.400
till somebody comes
tells you what to do.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.960
Yes, sir!

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.560
General Patton has said

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.800
that wars are fought with
weapons, but they are won by men.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.480
We are going to win this war
because we have the best men.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.960
And because they
are going to get better.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.040
Much better.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.640
<i>The Strategic Scientific
Reserve is an Allied effort</i>

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.160
<i>made up of the best
minds in the free world.</i>

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.360
<i>Our goal is to create
the best army in history.</i>

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.800
<i>But every army
starts with one man.</i>

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.040
Rogers! Get off of there!

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.240
<i>At the end of this week,
we will choose that man.</i>

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.440
He will be the first in a
new breed of super-soldier.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.080
Rogers! Get that
rifle out of the mud!

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.840
And they will personally escort
Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.280
Pick up the pace, ladies!

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.360
Let's go, let's go! Double time!

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.560
Come on! Faster! Faster!

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.320
Move! Move!

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.680
Squad, halt!

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.560
That flag means we're
only at the halfway point.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.680
First man to bring it to me gets
a ride back with Agent Carter.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.520
Move, move!

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.280
Come on! Get up there!

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.240
If that's all you got,
this army's in trouble!

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.920
Get up there, Hodge!

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.560
Come on! Get up there!

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.680
Nobody's got that
flag in 17 years!

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.640
Now fall back into
line! Come on, fall in!

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.000
Let's go! Get
back into formation!

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.720
Rogers! I said fall in!

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.560
Thank you, sir.

00:32:22.028 --> 00:32:23.788
What the hell did you do to me?

00:32:24.628 --> 00:32:26.148
What I did?

00:32:27.468 --> 00:32:29.228
What I did is to save your life.

00:32:29.468 --> 00:32:33.108
I removed all the shrapnel
I could, but there's a lot left,

00:32:33.188 --> 00:32:34.988
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.

00:32:35.748 --> 00:32:37.508
Here, want to see?

00:32:38.188 --> 00:32:40.988
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.

00:32:43.668 --> 00:32:45.908
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.

00:32:45.948 --> 00:32:48.428
We call them the walking dead

00:32:48.468 --> 00:32:51.668
because it takes about a week for
the barbs to reach the vital organs.

00:32:51.748 --> 00:32:54.548
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

00:32:55.308 --> 00:32:57.468
hooked up to a car battery,

00:32:57.508 --> 00:33:00.468
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart. Hmm?

00:33:08.708 --> 00:33:10.828
That's right. Smile.

00:33:12.508 --> 00:33:16.668
We met once, you know, at a
technical conference in Bern.

00:33:17.148 --> 00:33:19.708
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

00:33:20.068 --> 00:33:23.188
If I had been that drunk, I
wouldn't have been able to stand,

00:33:23.228 --> 00:33:26.428
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

00:33:26.508 --> 00:33:27.828
Where are we?

00:33:29.748 --> 00:33:31.668
Come on,
stand up. Stand up!

00:33:32.628 --> 00:33:34.668
Just do as I do.

00:33:35.348 --> 00:33:37.428
Come on, put your hands up.

00:33:39.188 --> 00:33:40.667
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

00:33:40.668 --> 00:33:43.108
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.

00:34:03.548 --> 00:34:07.788
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

00:34:07.868 --> 00:34:09.708
"in the history of America."

00:34:13.148 --> 00:34:14.668
He is honored.

00:34:17.148 --> 00:34:18.948
He wants you to
build the missile.

00:34:20.348 --> 00:34:22.668
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

00:34:26.228 --> 00:34:27.388
This one.

00:34:32.508 --> 00:34:33.508
I refuse.

00:34:44.268 --> 00:34:45.268
Tony!

00:35:35.268 --> 00:35:37.588
He wants to know what you think.

00:35:38.548 --> 00:35:40.348
I think you got
a lot of my weapons.

00:35:49.308 --> 00:35:53.468
He says they have everything
you need to build the Jericho missile.

00:35:54.108 --> 00:35:56.188
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

00:35:59.468 --> 00:36:02.068
He says for you
to start working immediately,

00:36:02.148 --> 00:36:05.428
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

00:36:08.868 --> 00:36:10.108
No, he won't.

00:36:10.708 --> 00:36:11.948
No, he won't.

00:36:21.787 --> 00:36:24.067
Faster, ladies! Come on.

00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:26.627
My grandmother has more
life in her, God rest her soul.

00:36:28.067 --> 00:36:29.107
Move it!

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:31.347
You're not really thinking
about picking Rogers, are you?

00:36:31.387 --> 00:36:34.347
I'm more than just thinking
about it. He is the clear choice.

00:36:34.387 --> 00:36:37.747
When you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base,

00:36:37.827 --> 00:36:39.227
I let it slide. I thought,
"What the hell."

00:36:39.307 --> 00:36:41.067
Maybe he'd be useful
to you, like a gerbil.

00:36:41.107 --> 00:36:42.187
I never thought you'd pick him.

00:36:42.227 --> 00:36:43.427
Up.

00:36:45.907 --> 00:36:48.267
You stick a needle in that kid's
arm, it's gonna go right through him.

00:36:48.387 --> 00:36:50.867
Come on, girls. Look at that.

00:36:51.787 --> 00:36:53.187
He's making me cry.

00:36:53.267 --> 00:36:55.867
I am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.

00:36:55.907 --> 00:36:58.587
Do you know how long it
took to set up this project?

00:36:58.627 --> 00:36:59.747
All the groveling I had to do

00:36:59.827 --> 00:37:01.027
in front of Senator
What's-His-Name's committees?

00:37:01.107 --> 00:37:03.347
Brandt. Yes, I know. I am
well aware of your efforts.

00:37:03.427 --> 00:37:06.667
Then throw me a bone. Hodge
passed every test we gave him.

00:37:06.747 --> 00:37:08.667
He's big, he's fast.
He obeys orders.

00:37:08.747 --> 00:37:10.227
- He's a soldier.
- He is a bully.

00:37:10.427 --> 00:37:13.227
You don't win wars
with niceness, Doctor.

00:37:16.507 --> 00:37:19.347
You win wars with guts.

00:37:21.427 --> 00:37:22.667
Grenade!

00:37:22.747 --> 00:37:24.067
Move, move!

00:37:27.147 --> 00:37:28.507
Get away!

00:37:28.987 --> 00:37:30.387
Get back!

00:37:37.667 --> 00:37:39.267
It was a dummy grenade.

00:37:40.307 --> 00:37:42.347
All clear. Back in formation.

00:37:46.627 --> 00:37:47.707
Is this a test?

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:50.627
He's still skinny.

00:37:59.128 --> 00:38:00.808
- May I?
- Yeah.

00:38:04.128 --> 00:38:05.488
Can't sleep?

00:38:06.088 --> 00:38:07.928
I got the jitters, I guess.

00:38:08.448 --> 00:38:09.808
Me, too.

00:38:11.568 --> 00:38:13.128
Can I ask you a question?

00:38:13.168 --> 00:38:14.608
Just one?

00:38:16.808 --> 00:38:18.208
Why me?

00:38:21.248 --> 00:38:24.048
I suppose that is the
only question that matters.

00:38:27.248 --> 00:38:30.248
This is from Augsburg. My city.

00:38:32.928 --> 00:38:34.008
So many people forget

00:38:34.048 --> 00:38:36.528
that the first country the
Nazis invaded was their own.

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:40.688
You know, after the last
war, my people struggled.

00:38:40.768 --> 00:38:43.688
They felt weak. They felt small.

00:38:43.768 --> 00:38:45.488
And then Hitler comes
along with the marching

00:38:45.608 --> 00:38:48.648
and the big show and the flags.

00:38:49.928 --> 00:38:53.968
And he hears of me. My
work. And he finds me.

00:38:54.008 --> 00:38:55.328
And he says, "You."

00:38:56.288 --> 00:38:58.048
He says, "You will
make us strong."

00:38:58.808 --> 00:39:01.488
Well, I am not interested.

00:39:02.848 --> 00:39:05.248
So he sends the head of Hydra,

00:39:05.688 --> 00:39:07.688
his research division.

00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:10.608
A brilliant scientist by the
name of Johann Schmidt.

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:13.328
Now, Schmidt is a
member of the inner circle.

00:39:13.368 --> 00:39:14.688
And he is ambitious.

00:39:15.128 --> 00:39:17.368
<i>He and Hitler share a passion</i>

00:39:17.408 --> 00:39:20.408
<i>for occult power
and Teutonic myth.</i>

00:39:21.168 --> 00:39:24.208
Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

00:39:24.248 --> 00:39:26.048
But for Schmidt,
it is not fantasy.

00:39:26.528 --> 00:39:29.568
For him, it is real. He
has become convinced

00:39:29.648 --> 00:39:32.208
that there is a great
power hidden in the earth,

00:39:32.248 --> 00:39:33.568
<i>left here by the gods,</i>

00:39:33.608 --> 00:39:36.448
waiting to be seized
by a superior man.

00:39:36.968 --> 00:39:40.568
So when he hears about
my formula and what it can do,

00:39:40.648 --> 00:39:42.048
he cannot resist.

00:39:45.088 --> 00:39:47.648
<i>Schmidt must become
that superior man.</i>

00:39:53.328 --> 00:39:54.448
Did it make him stronger?

00:39:54.648 --> 00:39:55.928
Yes.

00:39:56.328 --> 00:39:59.248
But there were other effects.

00:40:03.728 --> 00:40:04.888
The serum was not ready.

00:40:06.088 --> 00:40:09.088
But more important, the man.

00:40:10.008 --> 00:40:12.288
The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,

00:40:12.368 --> 00:40:15.568
so good becomes great.

00:40:15.608 --> 00:40:17.328
Bad becomes worse.

00:40:22.608 --> 00:40:24.288
This is why you were chosen.

00:40:25.368 --> 00:40:28.928
Because a strong man who
has known power all his life

00:40:28.968 --> 00:40:30.928
may lose respect for that power,

00:40:31.008 --> 00:40:34.248
but a weak man knows
the value of strength.

00:40:34.688 --> 00:40:36.608
And knows

00:40:37.128 --> 00:40:38.448
compassion.

00:40:41.608 --> 00:40:44.368
Thanks. I think.

00:40:50.288 --> 00:40:53.208
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

00:40:56.368 --> 00:40:58.528
That you will stay who you are.

00:41:01.008 --> 00:41:04.408
Not a perfect soldier, but

00:41:04.848 --> 00:41:06.848
a good man.

00:41:12.048 --> 00:41:13.528
To the little guys.

00:41:16.168 --> 00:41:17.608
No, no. Wait, wait.
What I am doing?

00:41:17.648 --> 00:41:19.808
No, you have procedure
tomorrow. No fluids.

00:41:21.088 --> 00:41:22.968
All right. We'll drink it after.

00:41:23.208 --> 00:41:24.968
No, I don't have
procedure tomorrow.

00:41:25.008 --> 00:41:26.608
Drink it after?
I drink it now.

00:41:31.466 --> 00:41:34.066
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.

00:41:34.146 --> 00:41:37.266
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

00:41:38.866 --> 00:41:42.626
Look, what you just saw,

00:41:43.426 --> 00:41:45.506
that is your legacy, Stark.

00:41:47.146 --> 00:41:50.506
Your life's work, in the
hands of those murderers.

00:41:50.586 --> 00:41:52.906
Is that how you want to go out?

00:41:53.426 --> 00:41:58.386
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

00:41:59.106 --> 00:42:00.746
Or are you going to
do something about it?

00:42:00.786 --> 00:42:05.906
Why should I do anything? They're
going to kill me, you, either way.

00:42:05.986 --> 00:42:09.266
And if they don't, I'll
probably be dead in a week.

00:42:09.346 --> 00:42:10.666
Well, then,

00:42:11.306 --> 00:42:14.386
this is a very important
week for you, isn't it?

00:42:15.106 --> 00:42:16.106
Hmm?

00:42:17.186 --> 00:42:18.642
If this is going to be
my work station,

00:42:18.666 --> 00:42:20.906
I want it well-lit.
I want these up.

00:42:20.946 --> 00:42:24.026
I need welding gear. I don't
care if it's acetylene or propane.

00:42:24.066 --> 00:42:26.322
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

00:42:26.346 --> 00:42:27.746
I would like a smelting cup.

00:42:27.826 --> 00:42:29.306
I need two sets
of precision tools.

00:42:42.746 --> 00:42:44.066
How many languages do you speak?

00:42:44.146 --> 00:42:45.186
A lot.

00:42:45.226 --> 00:42:47.986
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

00:42:48.026 --> 00:42:50.106
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

00:42:50.186 --> 00:42:53.586
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

00:42:54.746 --> 00:42:55.946
Who are these people?

00:42:56.026 --> 00:42:59.026
They are your
loyal customers, sir.

00:42:59.706 --> 00:43:01.746
They call
themselves the Ten Rings.

00:43:11.186 --> 00:43:12.626
You know,
we might be more productive

00:43:12.706 --> 00:43:15.506
if you include me
in the planning process.

00:43:15.666 --> 00:43:16.666
Uh-huh.

00:43:24.066 --> 00:43:26.306
Okay, we don't need this.

00:43:28.226 --> 00:43:29.746
What is that?

00:43:31.226 --> 00:43:33.586
That's palladium,
0.15 grams.

00:43:34.226 --> 00:43:37.626
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

00:43:54.186 --> 00:43:57.146
Careful. Careful,
we only get one shot at this.

00:43:57.226 --> 00:43:59.946
Relax. I have steady hands.

00:44:00.906 --> 00:44:03.426
Why do you think
you're still alive? Huh?

00:44:09.706 --> 00:44:11.666
What do I call you?

00:44:11.746 --> 00:44:13.386
My name is Yinsen.

00:44:13.586 --> 00:44:15.946
Yinsen.
Nice to meet you.

00:44:16.826 --> 00:44:18.706
Nice to meet you, too.

00:44:58.746 --> 00:45:01.026
That doesn't look
like a Jericho missile.

00:45:01.386 --> 00:45:04.586
That's because it's a
miniaturized arc reactor.

00:45:04.906 --> 00:45:07.706
I got a big one powering
my factory at home.

00:45:07.986 --> 00:45:10.786
It should keep the
shrapnel out of my heart.

00:45:10.826 --> 00:45:12.546
But what could it generate?

00:45:12.626 --> 00:45:17.186
If my math is right, and it always
is, three gigajoules per second.

00:45:17.666 --> 00:45:20.186
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

00:45:20.226 --> 00:45:23.306
Yeah. Or something
big for 15 minutes.

00:45:32.266 --> 00:45:34.586
This is our ticket out of here.

00:45:34.666 --> 00:45:36.306
What is it?

00:45:37.146 --> 00:45:38.706
Flatten them out and look.

00:45:41.346 --> 00:45:42.346
Oh, wow.

00:45:45.386 --> 00:45:46.946
Impressive.

00:45:50.477 --> 00:45:52.157
I know this neighborhood.

00:45:52.837 --> 00:45:55.037
I got beat up in that alley.

00:45:56.677 --> 00:45:57.717
And that parking lot.

00:45:59.997 --> 00:46:01.917
And behind that diner.

00:46:02.397 --> 00:46:04.837
Did you have something
against running away?

00:46:07.517 --> 00:46:10.037
You start running,
they'll never let you stop.

00:46:10.077 --> 00:46:12.197
You stand up, you push back.

00:46:12.237 --> 00:46:13.557
They can't say
no forever, right?

00:46:14.357 --> 00:46:16.197
I know a little of
what that's like,

00:46:16.237 --> 00:46:17.877
to have every door
shut in your face.

00:46:19.197 --> 00:46:21.037
I guess I just don't know why
you'd want to join the Army

00:46:21.117 --> 00:46:22.557
if you were a beautiful dame.

00:46:22.757 --> 00:46:24.197
Or a... a woman.

00:46:24.357 --> 00:46:25.717
An agent. Not a dame.

00:46:26.077 --> 00:46:27.677
You are beautiful, but...

00:46:28.397 --> 00:46:30.677
You have no idea how to
talk to a woman, do you?

00:46:31.197 --> 00:46:33.197
I think this is the longest
conversation I've had with one.

00:46:34.637 --> 00:46:38.237
Women aren't exactly lining up to
dance with a guy they might step on.

00:46:38.557 --> 00:46:39.877
You must have danced.

00:46:39.957 --> 00:46:42.637
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

00:46:43.717 --> 00:46:45.717
And the past few years, it just

00:46:45.797 --> 00:46:48.717
didn't seem to matter
that much. I figured I'd wait.

00:46:49.077 --> 00:46:50.277
For what?

00:46:51.917 --> 00:46:53.317
The right partner.

00:47:23.243 --> 00:47:25.923
Good roll.
Good roll.

00:47:26.723 --> 00:47:28.603
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

00:47:28.643 --> 00:47:31.483
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.

00:47:32.003 --> 00:47:33.483
It's actually a nice place.

00:47:34.043 --> 00:47:35.323
Got a family?

00:47:35.363 --> 00:47:39.723
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

00:47:40.523 --> 00:47:42.123
And you, Stark?

00:47:46.243 --> 00:47:47.283
No.

00:47:47.843 --> 00:47:48.883
No?

00:47:50.243 --> 00:47:52.803
So you're a man
who has everything

00:47:53.483 --> 00:47:54.843
and nothing.

00:49:33.243 --> 00:49:34.443
Relax.

00:49:43.563 --> 00:49:45.763
The bow and arrow

00:49:45.843 --> 00:49:48.723
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

00:49:51.283 --> 00:49:53.683
It allowed the great
Genghis Khan

00:49:54.483 --> 00:49:57.483
to rule from the
Pacific to the Ukraine.

00:49:58.083 --> 00:50:01.803
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

00:50:02.963 --> 00:50:06.483
and four times the size
of the Roman Empire.

00:50:10.123 --> 00:50:11.443
But today,

00:50:12.283 --> 00:50:15.723
whoever holds
the latest Stark weapons

00:50:16.763 --> 00:50:18.643
rules these lands.

00:50:20.963 --> 00:50:22.283
And soon,

00:50:25.323 --> 00:50:27.003
it will be my turn.

00:51:35.363 --> 00:51:37.503
What do you want?
A delivery date?

00:51:44.883 --> 00:51:46.203
I need him.

00:51:48.403 --> 00:51:49.883
Good assistant.

00:51:54.723 --> 00:51:58.723
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

00:52:16.178 --> 00:52:17.578
This way.

00:52:20.858 --> 00:52:23.258
- What are we doing here?
- Follow me.

00:52:36.618 --> 00:52:39.298
Wonderful weather
this morning, isn't it?

00:52:39.378 --> 00:52:41.618
Yes, but I always
carry an umbrella.

00:53:39.258 --> 00:53:40.818
Good morning.

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:43.698
Please, not now.

00:53:48.458 --> 00:53:49.658
Are you ready?

00:53:51.698 --> 00:53:55.258
Good. Take off your
shirt, your tie, and your hat.

00:54:59.901 --> 00:55:02.301
Okay? Can you move?

00:55:02.781 --> 00:55:04.621
Okay, say it again.

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:07.221
41 steps straight ahead.
Then 16 steps,

00:55:07.301 --> 00:55:10.781
that's from the door, fork
right, 33 steps, turn right.

00:55:32.881 --> 00:55:34.561
Senator Brandt, glad
you could make it.

00:55:34.641 --> 00:55:36.281
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

00:55:36.321 --> 00:55:38.241
We needed access
to the city's power grid.

00:55:38.321 --> 00:55:40.481
Of course, if you'd given me
the generators I requisitioned...

00:55:40.521 --> 00:55:42.721
A lot of people are
asking for funds, Colonel.

00:55:42.801 --> 00:55:44.241
Oh, this is Clem, uh...

00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:46.001
Fred Clemson, State Department.

00:55:46.081 --> 00:55:47.561
If this project of
yours comes through,

00:55:47.641 --> 00:55:50.321
we'd like to see it used for
something other than headlines.

00:55:50.361 --> 00:55:54.161
Jesus. Somebody
get that kid a sandwich.

00:56:07.121 --> 00:56:08.201
Comfortable?

00:56:10.281 --> 00:56:11.481
It's a little big.

00:56:13.761 --> 00:56:15.361
You save me any
of that schnapps?

00:56:16.361 --> 00:56:19.241
Not as much as I
should have. Sorry.

00:56:19.601 --> 00:56:20.921
Next time.

00:56:21.961 --> 00:56:24.161
Mr. Stark, how are your levels?

00:56:24.201 --> 00:56:26.481
Levels at 100%. Good.

00:56:26.521 --> 00:56:28.521
We may dim half
the lights in Brooklyn,

00:56:29.001 --> 00:56:31.801
but we are ready
as we'll ever be.

00:56:32.761 --> 00:56:33.881
Agent Carter?

00:56:33.921 --> 00:56:36.201
Don't you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth?

00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:37.921
Yes, of course. Sorry. Good.

00:56:50.721 --> 00:56:52.121
Do you hear me? Is this on?

00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:54.201
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:56:54.921 --> 00:56:58.401
today we take not another
step towards annihilation,

00:56:58.801 --> 00:57:00.041
but the first step

00:57:00.401 --> 00:57:02.441
on the path to peace.

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:07.841
We begin with a series
of microinjections into

00:57:07.881 --> 00:57:11.721
the subject's major muscle
groups. The serum infusion

00:57:12.081 --> 00:57:14.921
will cause immediate
cellular change.

00:57:15.401 --> 00:57:18.401
And then, to stimulate growth,

00:57:18.561 --> 00:57:22.041
the subject will be
saturated with Vita-Rays.

00:57:29.761 --> 00:57:30.881
That wasn't so bad.

00:57:31.521 --> 00:57:32.841
That was penicillin.

00:57:36.441 --> 00:57:38.681
Serum infusion beginning in

00:57:39.041 --> 00:57:40.081
five,

00:57:41.081 --> 00:57:42.121
four,

00:57:43.561 --> 00:57:44.601
three,

00:57:45.961 --> 00:57:47.521
two,

00:57:48.921 --> 00:57:49.961
one.

00:58:00.481 --> 00:58:01.881
Now, Mr. Stark.

00:58:26.231 --> 00:58:29.151
Yinsen!
Yinsen! Stark!

00:58:29.631 --> 00:58:31.271
Say something.
Say something back to him.

00:58:31.351 --> 00:58:33.751
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:35.031
Okay. I know.

00:58:35.071 --> 00:58:36.271
What do you know?

00:58:59.591 --> 00:59:01.711
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:03.791
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

00:59:03.831 --> 00:59:06.431
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

00:59:06.831 --> 00:59:07.831
Okay.

00:59:08.911 --> 00:59:10.111
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

00:59:10.191 --> 00:59:11.951
Function 11.

00:59:12.071 --> 00:59:13.791
Tell me when you
see a progress bar.

00:59:14.191 --> 00:59:15.471
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:16.727
Talk to me. Tell
me when you see it.

00:59:16.751 --> 00:59:18.271
- I have it.
- Press Control "I".

00:59:18.391 --> 00:59:20.791
- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "I" and "Enter."

00:59:20.871 --> 00:59:22.631
Come over here and button me up.

00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:26.831
Okay. All right.

00:59:26.911 --> 00:59:28.271
Every other hex bolt.

00:59:28.311 --> 00:59:30.471
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

00:59:30.511 --> 00:59:31.911
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

00:59:34.351 --> 00:59:36.687
Make sure the checkpoints are
clear before you follow me out, okay?

00:59:36.711 --> 00:59:38.471
We need more time.

00:59:39.631 --> 00:59:40.631
Hey,

00:59:41.471 --> 00:59:42.991
I'm gonna go buy you some time.

00:59:43.031 --> 00:59:44.671
Stick to the plan!

00:59:45.471 --> 00:59:46.871
Stick to the plan!

00:59:48.831 --> 00:59:50.031
Yinsen!

01:00:20.045 --> 01:00:23.045
Steven? Can you hear me?

01:00:23.405 --> 01:00:26.565
<i>It's probably too late to
go to the bathroom, right?</i>

01:00:28.005 --> 01:00:29.765
We will proceed.

01:00:42.245 --> 01:00:43.285
That's 10%.

01:00:44.445 --> 01:00:45.445
Twenty percent.

01:00:45.805 --> 01:00:46.965
Thirty.

01:00:49.605 --> 01:00:50.685
That's 40%.

01:00:52.165 --> 01:00:53.205
Vital signs are normal.

01:00:53.405 --> 01:00:54.445
That's 50%.

01:00:55.205 --> 01:00:56.245
Sixty.

01:00:57.925 --> 01:00:59.205
Seventy.

01:01:03.765 --> 01:01:04.805
Steven!

01:01:05.405 --> 01:01:07.325
Steven! Shut it down!

01:01:08.605 --> 01:01:09.685
Shut it down!

01:01:10.365 --> 01:01:11.525
Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark!

01:01:11.765 --> 01:01:13.325
Turn it off! Kill
it! Kill the reactor!

01:01:13.405 --> 01:01:14.765
No!

01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:17.765
Don't! I can do this!

01:01:24.645 --> 01:01:25.725
Eighty.

01:01:26.325 --> 01:01:27.365
Ninety.

01:01:28.805 --> 01:01:30.805
That's 100%!

01:04:18.127 --> 01:04:19.367
Yinsen!

01:04:19.407 --> 01:04:20.567
Watch out!

01:04:35.687 --> 01:04:36.847
Stark.

01:04:38.127 --> 01:04:40.247
Come on.
We got to go.

01:04:40.967 --> 01:04:43.887
Move for me, come on. We got
a plan. We're gonna stick to it.

01:04:43.927 --> 01:04:45.887
This was always the plan, Stark.

01:04:46.367 --> 01:04:48.487
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

01:04:49.967 --> 01:04:51.927
My family is dead.

01:04:52.727 --> 01:04:55.007
I'm going to see
them now, Stark.

01:04:57.447 --> 01:04:58.927
It's okay.

01:05:00.967 --> 01:05:03.967
I want this.
I want this.

01:05:09.967 --> 01:05:11.927
Thank you for saving me.

01:05:13.367 --> 01:05:17.367
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.

01:05:56.407 --> 01:05:57.447
My turn.

01:07:40.967 --> 01:07:42.047
Not bad.

01:08:13.967 --> 01:08:15.327
Hey!

01:08:37.927 --> 01:08:39.847
How was the "fun-vee"?

01:08:42.127 --> 01:08:44.527
Next time,
you ride with me, okay?

01:09:15.567 --> 01:09:17.367
Watch it, coming up here.

01:09:19.327 --> 01:09:22.487
Are you kidding
me with this? Get rid of them.

01:09:27.647 --> 01:09:28.647
Hmm.

01:09:30.727 --> 01:09:34.087
Your eyes are red. A few
tears for your long-lost boss?

01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:36.647
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.

01:09:37.407 --> 01:09:38.727
Yeah, vacation's over.

01:09:40.527 --> 01:09:41.647
Where to, sir?

01:09:41.727 --> 01:09:43.383
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

01:09:43.407 --> 01:09:44.527
No? Tony, you have to

01:09:44.567 --> 01:09:45.663
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

01:09:45.687 --> 01:09:47.503
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

01:09:47.527 --> 01:09:49.207
I've been in captivity
for three months.

01:09:49.247 --> 01:09:53.047
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

01:09:53.087 --> 01:09:54.143
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

01:09:54.167 --> 01:09:56.623
...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

01:09:56.647 --> 01:09:57.943
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

01:09:57.967 --> 01:10:00.527
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

01:10:13.007 --> 01:10:14.767
Look at this!

01:10:16.607 --> 01:10:17.807
Tony.

01:10:20.207 --> 01:10:21.583
We were going to
meet at the hospital.

01:10:21.607 --> 01:10:23.047
No, I'm fine.

01:10:23.127 --> 01:10:24.487
Look at you!

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:27.647
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

01:10:27.727 --> 01:10:28.887
You get me one of those?

01:10:28.967 --> 01:10:30.247
There's only one left.
I need it.

01:10:33.167 --> 01:10:35.967
Hey, look
who's here! Yeah!

01:10:41.327 --> 01:10:42.847
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

01:10:42.927 --> 01:10:44.207
Can I speak to you for a moment?

01:10:44.247 --> 01:10:46.407
I'm not part of
the press conference,

01:10:46.487 --> 01:10:47.887
but it's about to
begin right now.

01:10:47.967 --> 01:10:49.287
I'm not a reporter.

01:10:49.327 --> 01:10:50.807
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:52.663
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

01:10:52.687 --> 01:10:54.327
and Logistics Division.

01:10:54.407 --> 01:10:55.647
That's quite a mouthful.

01:10:55.687 --> 01:10:57.127
I know.
We're working on it.

01:10:57.167 --> 01:11:01.647
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

01:11:01.727 --> 01:11:05.407
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

01:11:05.487 --> 01:11:09.167
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.

01:11:09.247 --> 01:11:10.783
I'll put something
in the book, shall I?

01:11:10.807 --> 01:11:12.407
Thank you.

01:11:14.167 --> 01:11:15.527
Uh...

01:11:17.327 --> 01:11:19.927
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

01:11:20.007 --> 01:11:23.407
Why don't you just sit down? That
way you can see me, and I can...

01:11:23.607 --> 01:11:25.687
A little less formal and...

01:11:30.527 --> 01:11:32.087
What's up with the love-in?

01:11:32.167 --> 01:11:33.247
Don't look at me.

01:11:33.367 --> 01:11:35.407
I don't know what he's up to.

01:11:35.487 --> 01:11:36.607
Good to see you.

01:11:36.727 --> 01:11:37.887
Good to see you.

01:11:37.967 --> 01:11:40.407
I never got to say
goodbye to Dad.

01:11:40.647 --> 01:11:43.367
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.

01:11:47.207 --> 01:11:48.503
There's questions that
I would have asked him.

01:11:48.527 --> 01:11:51.607
I would have asked him how he
felt about what this company did.

01:11:53.087 --> 01:11:56.007
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

01:11:56.887 --> 01:12:01.207
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

01:12:05.527 --> 01:12:07.687
I saw young Americans killed

01:12:08.567 --> 01:12:12.567
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

01:12:14.007 --> 01:12:15.367
And I saw

01:12:16.567 --> 01:12:20.167
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

01:12:21.487 --> 01:12:23.447
- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

01:12:24.167 --> 01:12:25.447
What happened over there?

01:12:27.047 --> 01:12:30.727
I had my eyes opened. I
came to realize that I have more

01:12:30.767 --> 01:12:35.207
to offer this world than just
making things that blow up.

01:12:35.247 --> 01:12:38.727
And that is why, effective
immediately, I am shutting down

01:12:38.807 --> 01:12:42.487
the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:46.567
until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.

01:12:46.687 --> 01:12:48.263
I think we're gonna be
selling a lot of newspapers.

01:12:48.287 --> 01:12:50.103
What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

01:12:50.127 --> 01:12:54.207
and is consistent with the highest
good for this country, as well.

01:12:55.567 --> 01:13:00.367
What we should take away
from this is that Tony's back!

01:13:00.767 --> 01:13:03.087
And he's healthier than ever.

01:13:03.487 --> 01:13:06.607
<i>We're going to have
a little internal discussion...</i>

01:13:15.331 --> 01:13:17.291
Mr. Stark?

01:13:28.131 --> 01:13:30.051
Steven. Steven.

01:13:32.811 --> 01:13:34.171
The son of a bitch did it.

01:13:40.571 --> 01:13:41.931
I did it. Yeah, yeah.

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:43.771
I think we did it.

01:13:43.851 --> 01:13:45.091
You actually did it.

01:13:49.011 --> 01:13:50.651
How do you feel?

01:13:53.491 --> 01:13:55.091
Taller.

01:13:58.051 --> 01:13:59.411
You look taller.

01:13:59.691 --> 01:14:01.331
How do you like
Brooklyn now, Senator?

01:14:01.731 --> 01:14:05.651
I can think of some folks in Berlin
who are about to get very nervous.

01:14:08.091 --> 01:14:10.251
Congratulations, Doctor.

01:14:10.371 --> 01:14:12.051
Thank you, sir.
