WEBVTT

00:00:56.724 --> 00:00:58.183
Wait for it.

00:00:59.382 --> 00:01:01.501
- Can I turn on the radio?
- No.

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:07.987
Jane, you can't keep doing this.

00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:12.824
The last 17 occurrences
have been predictable to the second.

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:15.410
Jane, you're an astrophysicist,
not some storm chaser.

00:01:15.493 --> 00:01:17.328
I'm telling you, there is a connection…

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.206
between these atmospheric
disturbances and my research.

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.086
Erik, I wouldn't have asked you
to fly out here if I wasn't absolutely sure.

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:26.552
Jane?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.553
I think you want to see this.

00:01:32.343 --> 00:01:33.894
What is that?

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:43.563
I thought you said it was a subtle aurora!

00:01:43.822 --> 00:01:45.096
Go!

00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:53.002
Get closer.

00:01:53.127 --> 00:01:54.032
Right. Good one.

00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:55.195
Go!

00:02:13.128 --> 00:02:14.177
What are you doing?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.383
I am not dying for six college credits!

00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:40.395
I think that was legally your fault.

00:02:40.478 --> 00:02:41.955
Get the first aid kit.

00:02:42.038 --> 00:02:43.787
Do me a favour and don't be dead.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.989
Please.

00:02:50.647 --> 00:02:52.139
Where did he come from?

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:28.545
Stop him!

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:08.634
Stop him! We have it!

00:04:32.654 --> 00:04:33.721
What are you doing?

00:04:33.804 --> 00:04:35.301
Buddy, are you alright?

00:04:35.384 --> 00:04:37.417
Hey, this guy's been shot.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.729
I had him.

00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:51.406
Sorry.

00:05:11.526 --> 00:05:12.847
I am sorry.

00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:26.888
No. No!

00:06:26.971 --> 00:06:28.550
Not my son!

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.737
- Stop it.
- Don't hurt him!

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.819
Get back.

00:06:34.983 --> 00:06:36.472
Let me go.

00:06:38.505 --> 00:06:39.505
No!

00:06:39.647 --> 00:06:41.167
Let go of my son!

00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:44.756
Don't hurt him!

00:06:49.024 --> 00:06:50.839
Wait, don't. Don't.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.042
No. Don't.

00:06:59.568 --> 00:07:00.548
Go get him.

00:07:00.631 --> 00:07:01.930
I can swim.

00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:55.094
Who the hell are you?

00:07:55.177 --> 00:07:56.459
The first of many.

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.126
Cut off one head…

00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:02.578
two more shall take its place.

00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:06.021
Hail Hydra.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.028
Open it.

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:37.218
Quickly before he…

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:53.164
It has taken me a long time
to find this place.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.366
You should be commended.

00:09:57.449 --> 00:09:58.844
Help him up.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:06.556
I think that you are a man of great vision.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.045
And in this way, we are much alike.

00:10:09.128 --> 00:10:10.598
I am nothing like you.

00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:12.312
No, of course but…

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:17.813
what others see as superstition,
you and I know to be a science.

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:20.089
What you seek is just a legend.

00:10:20.172 --> 00:10:22.910
Then why make such
an effort to conceal it?

00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:47.854
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:55.553
It is not something one buries.

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:57.527
But…

00:10:57.747 --> 00:11:00.809
I think it is close, yes?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.679
I cannot help you.

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:03.884
No.

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:07.484
But maybe you can help your village.

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:09.501
You must have some friends out there.

00:11:09.584 --> 00:11:12.828
Some, some little
grandchildren perhaps?

00:11:13.335 --> 00:11:15.604
I have no need for them to die.

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.396
Yggdrasil.

00:11:32.238 --> 00:11:34.844
Tree of the world.

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:38.506
Guardian of wisdom.

00:11:41.014 --> 00:11:43.143
And fate, also.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:18.367
And the Führer digs
for trinkets in the desert.

00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.794
You have never seen this, have you?

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:28.832
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:30.590
Exactly.

00:12:33.831 --> 00:12:35.861
Give the order to open fire.

00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.806
Yes.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.218
Fool.

00:12:38.985 --> 00:12:41.364
You cannot control
the power you hold.

00:12:41.447 --> 00:12:42.876
You will burn.

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.458
I already have.

00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:09.956
I think that was legally your fault.

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.617
Get the first aid Kit.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.406
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:21.669
Does he need CPR?
Because I totally know CPR.

00:13:33.973 --> 00:13:35.464
Where did he come from?

00:13:39.353 --> 00:13:40.612
You alright?

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:41.996
Hammer?

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.911
Hammer?

00:13:42.994 --> 00:13:44.532
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:45.774
It's pretty obvious.

00:13:45.943 --> 00:13:48.217
Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!

00:13:48.397 --> 00:13:51.082
We have to move quickly
before this all changes.

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.153
Jane, we have to take him
to the hospital.

00:13:54.236 --> 00:13:56.299
- Father!
- He's fine, look at him.

00:13:56.382 --> 00:13:57.803
Heimdall!

00:13:57.886 --> 00:14:00.497
I know you can hear me!
Open the Bifrost!

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.473
Hospital. You go, I'll stay.

00:14:02.556 --> 00:14:04.882
You. What realm is this?

00:14:05.004 --> 00:14:06.710
Alfheim? Nornheim?

00:14:06.793 --> 00:14:08.094
New Mexico?

00:14:08.243 --> 00:14:09.757
You dare threaten me…

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.017
Thor, with so puny a weapon?

00:14:15.762 --> 00:14:17.640
What? He was freaking me out!

00:14:17.992 --> 00:14:20.019
Next time you decide
to taser somebody…

00:14:20.102 --> 00:14:22.504
make sure he's already in the car, ok?

00:14:23.689 --> 00:14:24.895
Jane!

00:14:25.003 --> 00:14:26.006
Come on.

00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:43.626
Well, that…

00:14:43.709 --> 00:14:45.204
That went well.

00:14:45.287 --> 00:14:47.410
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

00:14:47.493 --> 00:14:48.409
Your head?

00:14:48.492 --> 00:14:49.986
What about my head?

00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:53.154
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

00:14:53.237 --> 00:14:54.933
Optimistically, 40 points.

00:14:55.016 --> 00:14:56.576
At minimum.

00:14:56.659 --> 00:14:57.859
Yep.

00:14:57.993 --> 00:14:59.196
Tony…

00:14:59.406 --> 00:15:01.270
we're a weapons manufacturer.

00:15:01.353 --> 00:15:02.316
- Obie I just…
- Don't…

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:03.297
I don't want a body count…

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.900
- …to be our only legacy. That's it.
- That's what we do.

00:15:04.983 --> 00:15:06.633
We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:08.006
It's my name on the side
of the building.

00:15:08.089 --> 00:15:10.610
And what we do keeps the world
from falling into chaos.

00:15:10.693 --> 00:15:12.536
Not based on what I saw.

00:15:13.843 --> 00:15:15.174
We're not doing a good enough job.

00:15:15.257 --> 00:15:16.246
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:17.437
Like what?

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.484
You want us to make baby bottles?

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:23.338
I think we should take another
look into arc reactor technology.

00:15:23.698 --> 00:15:24.787
Come on.

00:15:25.013 --> 00:15:27.969
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.043
Tony, come on.

00:15:29.126 --> 00:15:31.360
We built that thing to shut the hippies up!

00:15:31.443 --> 00:15:32.007
It works.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.947
Yeah, as a science project.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.476
The arc was never cost effective.

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:38.326
We knew that before we built it.

00:15:38.409 --> 00:15:41.537
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.812
Maybe.

00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:45.861
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

00:15:46.103 --> 00:15:48.118
- 30 years.
- That's what they say.

00:15:51.137 --> 00:15:53.299
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

00:15:53.382 --> 00:15:54.496
Never mind who told me.
Who told you?

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:55.294
- Show me.
- Rhodey?

00:15:55.377 --> 00:15:56.594
Rhodey or Pepper?
It's Rhodey or Pepper.

00:15:56.677 --> 00:15:58.623
- I want to see it.
- Ok, Rhodey.

00:16:07.396 --> 00:16:09.156
Ok. Alright

00:16:12.234 --> 00:16:13.555
It works.

00:16:17.573 --> 00:16:19.014
Listen to me, Tony.

00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:21.744
We're a team. Do you understand?

00:16:21.827 --> 00:16:25.033
There's nothing we can't
do if we stick together…

00:16:25.116 --> 00:16:26.582
like your father and I.

00:16:26.665 --> 00:16:28.459
I'm sorry I didn't give
you a heads-up, ok?

00:16:28.542 --> 00:16:30.086
- But if I had…
- Tony.

00:16:30.169 --> 00:16:33.172
Tony, no more of this ready,
fire, aim business.

00:16:33.255 --> 00:16:35.338
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

00:16:36.592 --> 00:16:38.709
You got to let me handle this.

00:16:38.844 --> 00:16:41.182
We're gonna have to play a whole
different kind of ball now.

00:16:41.265 --> 00:16:43.096
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

00:16:43.179 --> 00:16:46.686
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

00:16:46.769 --> 00:16:48.521
<i>Stark Industries!</i>

00:16:48.604 --> 00:16:51.782
<i>I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?</i>

00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:52.859
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

00:16:52.942 --> 00:16:54.902
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

00:16:54.985 --> 00:16:58.569
<i>Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?</i>

00:16:59.624 --> 00:17:05.032
<i>Let me show you the new Stark
Industries business plan!</i>

00:17:06.288 --> 00:17:10.139
<i>Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!</i>

00:17:11.085 --> 00:17:13.964
<i>Pepper.
How big are your hands?</i>

00:17:14.129 --> 00:17:16.149
- What?
- <i>How big are your hands?</i>

00:17:16.387 --> 00:17:19.173
- I don't understand why…
- <i>Get down here. I need you.</i>

00:17:26.615 --> 00:17:27.744
Hey.

00:17:29.812 --> 00:17:31.006
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.180
Let's see them.

00:17:33.683 --> 00:17:36.138
Oh. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

00:17:36.777 --> 00:17:39.154
I just need your help for a sec.

00:17:40.114 --> 00:17:42.283
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

00:17:42.366 --> 00:17:45.291
It was. It is now an antique.

00:17:45.744 --> 00:17:48.579
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.

00:17:48.662 --> 00:17:50.460
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit…

00:17:50.543 --> 00:17:53.380
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

00:17:53.502 --> 00:17:54.879
Speed bump, what does that mean?

00:17:54.962 --> 00:17:56.255
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

00:17:56.338 --> 00:17:57.642
There's an exposed…

00:17:57.725 --> 00:17:59.717
wire under this device.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.969
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

00:18:03.052 --> 00:18:04.052
It's…

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:05.105
fine.

00:18:05.188 --> 00:18:07.089
- What? What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

00:18:07.172 --> 00:18:09.352
- Oh, my God!
- That is irrelevant.

00:18:09.435 --> 00:18:10.645
I want you to reach in…

00:18:10.728 --> 00:18:13.108
and you're just gonna gently
lift the wire out.

00:18:14.523 --> 00:18:15.418
Is it safe?

00:18:15.501 --> 00:18:16.606
Yeah, it should be fine.

00:18:16.689 --> 00:18:18.483
It's like operation.
You just don't let it touch…

00:18:18.566 --> 00:18:20.139
- the socket wall or it goes beep.
- What's operati--

00:18:20.222 --> 00:18:22.187
- What do you mean operation?
- It's just a game, never mind.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.533
Just gently lift the wire.
Ok?

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.664
Ok. Great.

00:18:28.245 --> 00:18:29.249
You know, I. I…

00:18:29.332 --> 00:18:30.829
I don't think that
I'm qualified to do this.

00:18:30.912 --> 00:18:31.929
No, you're fine.

00:18:32.012 --> 00:18:34.877
You're the most capable, qualified…

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.912
trustworthy person I've ever met.

00:18:36.995 --> 00:18:38.752
You're gonna do great.

00:18:39.757 --> 00:18:41.717
- Is it too much of a problem to ask?
- Because I'm… I'm…

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.689
- Ok, ok.
- I really need your help here.

00:18:44.553 --> 00:18:45.743
Ok.

00:18:49.975 --> 00:18:51.602
Oh, there is pus!

00:18:51.685 --> 00:18:56.315
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device…

00:18:56.398 --> 00:18:58.317
not from my body.
It smells!

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.782
Yeah, it does.

00:19:00.277 --> 00:19:01.570
The copper wire.

00:19:01.777 --> 00:19:02.989
- The copper wire, you got it?
- Ok.

00:19:03.072 --> 00:19:04.156
- I got it! I got it!
- Ok, you got it?

00:19:04.239 --> 00:19:05.732
Now, don't let it touch…

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.159
the sides, sides when you're coming out!

00:19:07.242 --> 00:19:07.848
- That's what I was…
- I'm sorry.

00:19:07.931 --> 00:19:09.658
- …trying to tell you before.
- I'm sorry.

00:19:09.771 --> 00:19:11.790
Ok, now make sure that when
you pull it out, you don't pull…

00:19:11.873 --> 00:19:13.916
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it.

00:19:13.999 --> 00:19:15.001
You just pulled it out.

00:19:15.084 --> 00:19:16.090
- Oh, God! Ok.
- Ok, I was not…

00:19:16.173 --> 00:19:18.214
- What do I do?
- …expecting, don't put it back in!

00:19:18.546 --> 00:19:19.289
What's wrong?

00:19:19.372 --> 00:19:21.253
Nothing, I'm just going into
cardiac arrest because…

00:19:21.336 --> 00:19:23.698
- you yanked it out like a trout…
- What? You said it was safe!

00:19:23.781 --> 00:19:25.259
- We got to hurry. Take this. Take this.
- Ok.

00:19:25.342 --> 00:19:26.764
- You got to switch it out really quick.
- Ok. Ok.

00:19:26.847 --> 00:19:27.513
Ok.

00:19:27.596 --> 00:19:28.411
- Tony?
- What?

00:19:28.494 --> 00:19:29.353
It's going to be ok.

00:19:29.436 --> 00:19:30.656
- Is it?
- It's gonna be ok.

00:19:30.739 --> 00:19:32.982
- Let's hope.
- I'm gonna make this ok.

00:19:33.769 --> 00:19:34.906
- Ok, you're gonna attach that…
- Ok.

00:19:34.989 --> 00:19:36.260
to the base plate.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.952
And make sure you…

00:19:41.944 --> 00:19:43.311
Was that so hard?

00:19:43.394 --> 00:19:44.363
That was fun, right?

00:19:44.446 --> 00:19:46.290
Here, I got it. I got it.
Here.

00:19:46.657 --> 00:19:47.700
Nice.

00:19:47.783 --> 00:19:50.036
Are you ok?
Yeah, I feel great.

00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:51.173
You ok?

00:19:52.788 --> 00:19:55.708
Don't ever, ever, ever…

00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:58.753
ever, ask me to do anything
like that ever again.

00:19:58.836 --> 00:20:01.013
I don't have anyone but you.

00:20:06.635 --> 00:20:07.935
Anyway…

00:20:13.559 --> 00:20:15.019
What do you want me
to do with this?

00:20:15.102 --> 00:20:16.109
That?

00:20:17.203 --> 00:20:18.424
Destroy it.

00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:20.547
Incinerate it.

00:20:21.263 --> 00:20:22.879
You don't want to keep it?

00:20:22.962 --> 00:20:24.595
Pepper, I've been called many things.

00:20:24.678 --> 00:20:26.644
Nostalgic is not one of them.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.116
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

00:20:29.199 --> 00:20:30.947
That will be all, Miss Potts.

00:20:32.161 --> 00:20:33.714
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

00:20:33.996 --> 00:20:35.915
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

00:20:35.998 --> 00:20:37.077
That's my phone…

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.168
that's a picture of me and my dad.

00:20:39.251 --> 00:20:42.179
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

00:20:58.648 --> 00:21:01.075
Are you ready, Dr. Zola?

00:21:02.252 --> 00:21:06.181
My machine requires
the most delicate calibration.

00:21:07.567 --> 00:21:10.089
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.

00:21:10.172 --> 00:21:12.344
Are you certain
that those conductors of yours…

00:21:12.427 --> 00:21:16.578
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?

00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:18.584
With this artifact.

00:21:18.701 --> 00:21:20.448
I am certain of nothing.

00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:22.815
I fear it may not work at all.

00:21:59.755 --> 00:22:01.374
Twenty percent.

00:22:03.223 --> 00:22:04.669
Forty.

00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:08.786
Sixty.

00:22:11.638 --> 00:22:14.027
Stabilizing at 70%.

00:22:15.558 --> 00:22:19.816
I have not come all this way
for safety, Doctor.

00:22:37.926 --> 00:22:39.414
What was that?

00:22:39.916 --> 00:22:42.941
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

00:22:43.153 --> 00:22:46.062
Your designs do not disappoint.

00:22:46.533 --> 00:22:50.731
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:53.863
The exchange is stable.

00:22:54.263 --> 00:22:55.825
Amazing.

00:22:56.486 --> 00:23:00.467
The energy we have just collected
could power my designs.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.216
All my designs.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.738
This will change the war.

00:23:07.246 --> 00:23:09.084
Dr. Zola…

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:13.419
this will change the world.

00:23:21.287 --> 00:23:22.453
Name?

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.150
He said it was Thor?

00:23:25.336 --> 00:23:28.837
T-H-O-R.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.442
And your relationship to him?

00:23:30.525 --> 00:23:31.548
I've never met him before.

00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:33.175
Until she hit him with a car.

00:23:33.258 --> 00:23:34.564
I grazed him…

00:23:34.885 --> 00:23:36.323
but she tasered him.

00:23:36.406 --> 00:23:37.635
Yes, I did.

00:23:39.264 --> 00:23:40.565
Hi.

00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:42.938
Just taking a little blood.

00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:45.145
How dare you attack
the son of Odin?

00:23:45.228 --> 00:23:46.913
I need some help!
Some help!

00:23:48.211 --> 00:23:49.820
Call security!

00:23:49.983 --> 00:23:51.867
Security to ER 3, stat!

00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:08.505
You're no match for the Mighty…

00:25:08.643 --> 00:25:10.337
Jarvis, you up?

00:25:10.437 --> 00:25:12.230
<i>For you sir, always.</i>

00:25:12.313 --> 00:25:13.937
I'd like to open a new project file…

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.034
index as Mark Two.

00:25:17.402 --> 00:25:20.801
<i>Shall I store this on the Stark
Industries Central Database?</i>

00:25:21.364 --> 00:25:23.622
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

00:25:23.825 --> 00:25:26.619
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

00:25:26.702 --> 00:25:29.421
<i>Working on a secret
project, are we, sir?</i>

00:25:33.418 --> 00:25:35.651
I don't want this winding
up in the wrong hands.

00:25:38.631 --> 00:25:40.850
Maybe in mine, it can
actually do some good.

00:25:42.429 --> 00:25:43.500
Next.

00:25:44.353 --> 00:25:45.513
Up.

00:25:45.808 --> 00:25:48.618
Not in the boot, Dummy.
Right here. You got me?

00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:49.889
Stay put.

00:25:49.972 --> 00:25:51.018
Nice.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.048
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

00:25:56.986 --> 00:25:59.079
Ok, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

00:26:06.036 --> 00:26:07.075
Up.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.575
Screw it. Don't even move.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.040
You…

00:26:11.923 --> 00:26:13.609
are a tragedy.

00:26:22.896 --> 00:26:25.376
<i>Ok, let's do this right.</i>

00:26:26.182 --> 00:26:28.580
<i>Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.</i>

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.949
<i>Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.</i>

00:26:34.032 --> 00:26:35.417
You, roll it.

00:26:37.818 --> 00:26:38.818
<i>Ok.</i>

00:26:40.133 --> 00:26:41.730
<i>Activate hand controls.</i>

00:26:45.701 --> 00:26:46.804
<i>We're gonna start off nice and easy.</i>

00:26:46.887 --> 00:26:49.940
<i>We're gonna see if 10% thrust
capacity achieves lift.</i>

00:26:50.164 --> 00:26:51.536
<i>And three…</i>

00:26:52.374 --> 00:26:53.374
<i>two…</i>

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.210
<i>one.</i>

00:27:32.456 --> 00:27:34.751
Up two. Alright, set that.

00:27:34.834 --> 00:27:37.128
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

00:27:37.211 --> 00:27:39.172
Yeah, everything's… What?

00:27:39.255 --> 00:27:40.481
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

00:27:40.564 --> 00:27:42.029
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

00:27:43.008 --> 00:27:44.008
Ok.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.763
I thought you said you
were done making weapons.

00:27:46.846 --> 00:27:47.847
It is.

00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:51.854
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.479
I didn't expect that.

00:28:02.528 --> 00:28:03.615
How'd it go?

00:28:06.198 --> 00:28:07.803
It went that bad?

00:28:07.908 --> 00:28:10.620
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York…

00:28:10.703 --> 00:28:12.381
doesn't mean it went bad.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:14.483
Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

00:28:14.566 --> 00:28:16.590
It would have gone better
if you were there.

00:28:17.835 --> 00:28:19.297
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.714
- I lay low and you take care of all…
- Hey, come on.

00:28:21.797 --> 00:28:24.144
In public. The press.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.365
- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was…

00:28:27.636 --> 00:28:29.442
This was a board of directors meeting?

00:28:30.264 --> 00:28:32.753
The board is claiming you
have posttraumatic stress.

00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:33.935
They're filing an injunction.

00:28:34.018 --> 00:28:34.562
A what?

00:28:34.645 --> 00:28:36.062
They want to lock you out.

00:28:36.145 --> 00:28:37.355
Why, because the stocks
dipped 40 points?

00:28:37.438 --> 00:28:38.439
We knew that was gonna happen.

00:28:38.522 --> 00:28:40.608
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

00:28:40.691 --> 00:28:42.855
We own the controlling
interest in the company.

00:28:42.938 --> 00:28:45.997
Tony, the board has rights, too.

00:28:46.614 --> 00:28:48.238
They're making the case…

00:28:48.321 --> 00:28:50.493
that you and your new direction…

00:28:50.576 --> 00:28:52.783
- …isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

00:28:52.866 --> 00:28:54.048
That's a new direction…

00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:55.802
for me, for the company.

00:28:56.832 --> 00:29:00.266
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that…

00:29:00.795 --> 00:29:01.916
This is great.

00:29:02.358 --> 00:29:05.063
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

00:29:05.424 --> 00:29:07.635
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

00:29:07.718 --> 00:29:11.057
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you got to give me something.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.477
Something to pitch them.

00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:15.185
Let me have the engineers analyze that.

00:29:15.268 --> 00:29:16.352
You know, draw up some specs.

00:29:16.435 --> 00:29:18.604
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys…

00:29:18.687 --> 00:29:20.226
- This one stays with me.
- …in New York!

00:29:20.309 --> 00:29:21.441
That's it, Obie. Forget it.

00:29:21.524 --> 00:29:23.054
Alright, well, this stays with me, then.

00:29:23.137 --> 00:29:25.025
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

00:29:25.108 --> 00:29:26.521
- Take two.
- Thank you.

00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:28.546
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

00:29:28.629 --> 00:29:29.629
Good night, Obie.

00:29:38.664 --> 00:29:41.197
<i>You don't think this was just
a magnetic storm, do you?</i>

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.049
Look, the lensing around these edges…

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.702
is characteristic
of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:47.829
A what?

00:29:47.912 --> 00:29:49.997
- I thought you were a science major?
- Political science.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.775
She was the only applicant.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.749
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection…

00:29:54.832 --> 00:29:56.003
between two different points
of space-time.

00:29:56.086 --> 00:29:57.280
It's a wormhole.

00:29:57.363 --> 00:29:58.309
Erik…

00:29:58.392 --> 00:29:59.880
Look. What do you see?

00:29:59.963 --> 00:30:00.508
Stars.

00:30:00.591 --> 00:30:02.577
Yeah, but not our stars.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.264
See, this is the star alignment
for our quadrant this time of year…

00:30:06.347 --> 00:30:09.567
and unless Ursa Minor decided
to take a day off…

00:30:09.862 --> 00:30:11.769
these are someone
else's constellations.

00:30:11.852 --> 00:30:13.520
Hey! Check this out.

00:30:20.486 --> 00:30:22.154
No, it can't be.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.577
I think I left something at the hospital.

00:30:41.882 --> 00:30:44.260
It's not possible!

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.441
<i>He was on drugs or something.
He just went nuts.</i>

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.890
Oh, my God.

00:31:14.233 --> 00:31:16.361
I just lost my most important
piece of evidence.

00:31:16.444 --> 00:31:17.363
Typical.

00:31:17.446 --> 00:31:18.538
So now what?

00:31:18.621 --> 00:31:19.670
We find him.

00:31:19.753 --> 00:31:21.269
Did you see what he did in there?

00:31:21.352 --> 00:31:23.007
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.395
Well, our data can't tell us
what it was like to be inside that event…

00:31:25.478 --> 00:31:27.805
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:29.409
Ok.

00:31:29.492 --> 00:31:31.748
So we're gonna look
all over New Mexico, right?

00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:33.418
Exactly.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:38.899
What?

00:31:39.773 --> 00:31:40.905
I'm so sorry.

00:31:40.988 --> 00:31:43.248
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

00:32:00.044 --> 00:32:01.539
I got it, I got it.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:13.573
Come on, kick it in now!

00:32:22.103 --> 00:32:23.620
Did it Work?

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.105
Sir…

00:32:46.276 --> 00:32:47.494
we found it.

00:33:00.876 --> 00:33:03.961
Is there something
in particular you need?

00:33:09.585 --> 00:33:10.387
I…

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.684
I understand you found him.

00:33:13.222 --> 00:33:15.149
See for yourself.

00:33:27.064 --> 00:33:28.854
You disapprove.

00:33:29.204 --> 00:33:32.272
I just don't see
why you need concern yourself.

00:33:32.355 --> 00:33:34.584
I can't imagine he will succeed.

00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:38.219
Again.

00:33:38.714 --> 00:33:42.827
His serum is the Allies' only defense
against this power we now possess.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:46.050
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

00:33:49.625 --> 00:33:51.409
Shall I give the order?

00:33:52.361 --> 00:33:54.224
It has been given.

00:33:56.504 --> 00:33:57.797
Good.

00:34:00.896 --> 00:34:02.299
Dr. Zola.

00:34:05.707 --> 00:34:07.132
What do you think?

00:34:13.882 --> 00:34:15.479
A masterpiece.

00:34:29.207 --> 00:34:32.338
You know, for a crazy
homeless person, he's…

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:33.775
pretty cut.

00:34:36.673 --> 00:34:38.480
Hey, sorry I tased you!

00:34:41.094 --> 00:34:43.278
Excuse me, excuse me!

00:34:50.436 --> 00:34:51.839
What is this?

00:34:54.774 --> 00:34:56.157
My ex.

00:34:56.567 --> 00:35:00.650
Good with patients
and bad with relationships.

00:35:01.653 --> 00:35:03.074
They're the only clothes I had
that would fit you.

00:35:03.157 --> 00:35:04.504
They will suffice.

00:35:05.285 --> 00:35:06.261
You're welcome.

00:35:06.344 --> 00:35:08.425
This mortal form has grown weak.

00:35:08.783 --> 00:35:10.179
I need sustenance.

00:35:15.499 --> 00:35:17.418
<i>How'd you get inside that cloud?</i>

00:35:17.501 --> 00:35:20.246
Also, how could you eat
an entire box of Pop-Tarts…

00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:22.037
and still be this hungry?

00:35:27.428 --> 00:35:28.750
This drink, I like it.

00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:29.806
I know. It's great, right?

00:35:29.889 --> 00:35:30.889
Another!

00:35:32.389 --> 00:35:34.865
Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

00:35:37.688 --> 00:35:39.701
- What was that?
- It was delicious. I want another.

00:35:39.784 --> 00:35:41.855
- Well, you could have just said so.
- I just did.

00:35:41.938 --> 00:35:43.844
No, I mean, ask nicely.

00:35:43.927 --> 00:35:45.113
I meant no disrespect.

00:35:45.196 --> 00:35:47.019
Alright. Well, no more smashing.

00:35:47.239 --> 00:35:48.631
Deal?

00:35:50.785 --> 00:35:52.086
You have my word.

00:35:53.037 --> 00:35:54.188
Good.

00:35:55.542 --> 00:35:57.257
The usual, please, Izzy.

00:35:57.458 --> 00:36:00.295
You missed all the excitement
out at the crater.

00:36:00.378 --> 00:36:03.317
They're saying some kind
of satellite landed out in the desert.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.758
Yeah, we were having
a good time with it…

00:36:05.841 --> 00:36:07.430
until the Feds showed up.

00:36:07.513 --> 00:36:09.950
Excuse me.
Did you say there was a satellite crash?

00:36:10.033 --> 00:36:11.075
Yeah.

00:36:11.221 --> 00:36:12.232
Oh, my God.

00:36:12.315 --> 00:36:14.044
This is going on Facebook. Smile.

00:36:16.413 --> 00:36:18.289
What did it look like, the satellite?

00:36:18.896 --> 00:36:20.857
I don't know anything about satellites…

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.410
but it was heavy.

00:36:22.566 --> 00:36:23.737
I mean…

00:36:23.884 --> 00:36:25.552
nobody could lift it.

00:36:26.153 --> 00:36:29.127
They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.

00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:30.607
Which way?

00:36:32.743 --> 00:36:34.455
50 miles west of here.

00:36:35.079 --> 00:36:36.621
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

00:36:36.704 --> 00:36:38.945
Looked like the whole Army
was coming when we left.

00:36:43.861 --> 00:36:44.905
Dumbass!

00:36:46.186 --> 00:36:47.626
Where are you going?

00:36:47.709 --> 00:36:49.978
- 50 miles west of here.
- Why?

00:36:50.061 --> 00:36:51.427
To get what belongs to me.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.097
Oh, so you own a satellite now?

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.375
It's not what they say it is.

00:36:54.458 --> 00:36:55.308
Well, whatever it is…

00:36:55.391 --> 00:36:56.653
the government seems to think
it's theirs.

00:36:56.736 --> 00:36:57.347
So…

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.017
you just intend to go in there
and take it?

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.139
Yes.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.997
If you take me there now…

00:37:03.091 --> 00:37:04.734
I'll tell you everything
you wish to know.

00:37:04.817 --> 00:37:06.027
Everything?
Yes.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:08.905
All the answers you seek will be yours
once I reclaim Mjolnir.

00:37:08.988 --> 00:37:10.112
Myeu-muh?

00:37:10.195 --> 00:37:11.032
What's Myeu-muh?

00:37:11.115 --> 00:37:12.740
Can I have a word, Jane?

00:37:17.121 --> 00:37:18.657
Please don't do this.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.792
You saw what I saw last night.

00:37:20.875 --> 00:37:23.294
This is no coincidence.
We have to find out what's in that crater.

00:37:23.377 --> 00:37:25.338
But I'm not talking about the crater,
I'm talking about him.

00:37:25.421 --> 00:37:28.132
- But he's promising us the answers.
- He's delusional.

00:37:28.215 --> 00:37:29.258
Listen to what he's saying.

00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:32.976
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

00:37:33.596 --> 00:37:35.807
It's the stories I grew up
with as a child.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.851
I'm just going to drive him.
That's it.

00:37:38.934 --> 00:37:40.950
He's dangerous, Jane.

00:37:46.859 --> 00:37:48.344
I'm sorry…

00:37:48.427 --> 00:37:49.903
but I can't take you.

00:37:49.986 --> 00:37:51.754
Then this is where we say goodbye.

00:38:01.791 --> 00:38:03.069
Thank you?

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.668
Jane Foster…

00:38:06.045 --> 00:38:07.408
Erik Selvig…

00:38:07.713 --> 00:38:08.713
Darcy…

00:38:09.423 --> 00:38:10.623
farewell.

00:38:14.386 --> 00:38:15.688
Alright.

00:38:16.388 --> 00:38:17.783
Back to work.

00:38:37.056 --> 00:38:38.135
Hey!

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:40.303
That's my stuff!

00:38:44.708 --> 00:38:46.270
What the hell is going on here?

00:38:46.353 --> 00:38:48.087
Ms. Foster,
I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:49.762
Is that supposed to mean something
to me?

00:38:49.845 --> 00:38:51.349
- You can't do this!
- Jane!

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.427
Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realize. Let it go.

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:56.858
Let it go? This is my life.

00:38:57.012 --> 00:38:58.890
We're investigating a security threat.

00:38:58.973 --> 00:39:01.684
We need to appropriate your records
and all your atmospheric data.

00:39:01.767 --> 00:39:03.993
By appropriate, do you mean steal?

00:39:04.498 --> 00:39:07.106
Here, this should more than
compensate you for your trouble.

00:39:07.189 --> 00:39:09.734
I can't just buy replacements
at Radio Shack…

00:39:09.817 --> 00:39:11.643
I made most of this equipment myself!

00:39:11.726 --> 00:39:12.945
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

00:39:13.028 --> 00:39:16.226
And I'm sure I can sue you
for violating my constitutional rights!

00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:17.571
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster…

00:39:17.654 --> 00:39:18.663
but we're the good guys.

00:39:18.746 --> 00:39:20.038
So are we!

00:39:20.995 --> 00:39:24.418
I'm on the verge of understanding
something extraordinary.

00:39:24.501 --> 00:39:26.084
And everything I know
about this phenomenon…

00:39:26.167 --> 00:39:28.254
is either in this lab or in this book.

00:39:28.337 --> 00:39:30.219
And you can't just take this away…

00:39:30.311 --> 00:39:31.379
Hey!

00:39:31.536 --> 00:39:34.125
Jane! Easy! Easy.

00:39:34.208 --> 00:39:35.208
Jane…

00:39:37.136 --> 00:39:39.008
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:39:49.278 --> 00:39:52.794
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.

00:39:52.877 --> 00:39:54.075
For lack of a better option…

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:56.828
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again…

00:39:56.911 --> 00:39:59.722
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:01.161
<i>Alright, nice and easy.</i>

00:40:01.687 --> 00:40:02.843
<i>Seriously…</i>

00:40:02.926 --> 00:40:04.436
<i>just gonna start off…</i>

00:40:04.519 --> 00:40:06.681
<i>with 1% thrust capacity.</i>

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:10.278
<i>And three, two, one.</i>

00:40:22.017 --> 00:40:23.017
Ok.

00:40:24.669 --> 00:40:26.066
Please don't follow me
around with it either…

00:40:26.149 --> 00:40:28.526
because I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:30.320
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

00:40:30.403 --> 00:40:32.550
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

00:40:32.739 --> 00:40:34.779
Three, two, one.

00:40:50.965 --> 00:40:52.915
Ok, this is where I don't want to be!

00:40:53.634 --> 00:40:55.269
Oh, not the car, not the car!

00:40:56.304 --> 00:40:57.604
Table!

00:41:08.662 --> 00:41:10.439
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine!

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:13.170
Ok.

00:41:30.671 --> 00:41:31.671
No!!

00:41:34.237 --> 00:41:36.115
Yeah, I can fly.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.556
<i>Jarvis, are you there?</i>

00:41:41.639 --> 00:41:43.389
<i>At your service, sir.</i>

00:41:43.684 --> 00:41:44.933
Engage Heads Up Display.

00:41:45.016 --> 00:41:45.895
<i>Check.</i>

00:41:45.978 --> 00:41:47.939
Import all preferences
from home interface.

00:41:48.022 --> 00:41:49.234
<i>Will do, sir.</i>

00:41:56.531 --> 00:41:57.838
Alright, what do you say?

00:41:57.921 --> 00:41:59.596
<i>I have indeed been uploaded, sir.</i>

00:41:59.679 --> 00:42:01.119
We're online and ready.

00:42:01.202 --> 00:42:02.856
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

00:42:02.939 --> 00:42:05.915
<i>Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.</i>

00:42:05.998 --> 00:42:07.323
Do a check on control surfaces.

00:42:07.406 --> 00:42:08.954
<i>As you wish.</i>

00:42:30.857 --> 00:42:33.773
<i>Test complete. Preparing to power
down and begin diagnostics.</i>

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:36.404
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:37.908
Start listening in on ground control.

00:42:37.991 --> 00:42:39.292
<i>Sir, there are still terabytes…</i>

00:42:39.375 --> 00:42:41.826
<i>of calculations needed before
an actual flight is…</i>

00:42:41.909 --> 00:42:43.002
Jarvis!

00:42:43.085 --> 00:42:45.830
Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

00:42:45.913 --> 00:42:46.421
Ready?

00:42:46.504 --> 00:42:50.260
In three, two, one.

00:43:13.483 --> 00:43:14.938
Handles like a dream.

00:43:43.353 --> 00:43:44.998
Alright, let's see what this thing can do.

00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:46.567
What's SR-71's record?

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:50.400
<i>The altitude record for fixed
wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.</i>

00:43:50.812 --> 00:43:52.957
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

00:43:56.651 --> 00:43:59.814
<i>Sir, there is a potentially
fatal buildup of ice occurring.</i>

00:44:00.321 --> 00:44:01.621
Keep going!

00:44:03.699 --> 00:44:05.055
Higher!

00:44:18.673 --> 00:44:21.164
We iced up, Jarvis! Deploy flaps!

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:23.367
Jarvis!

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.632
Come on, we got to break the ice!

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:04.385
Kill power.

00:46:04.147 --> 00:46:05.788
Years of research…

00:46:06.066 --> 00:46:07.095
gone.

00:46:07.687 --> 00:46:09.755
They even took my iPod.

00:46:10.317 --> 00:46:11.444
What about the backups?

00:46:11.527 --> 00:46:12.906
They took our backups.

00:46:12.989 --> 00:46:14.850
They took the backups of our backups.

00:46:14.933 --> 00:46:16.682
They were extremely thorough.

00:46:16.765 --> 00:46:18.977
I just downloaded, like,
30 songs onto there.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.450
Could you please stop with your iPod?

00:46:22.457 --> 00:46:24.520
Who are these people?

00:46:26.211 --> 00:46:28.059
I knew this scientist.

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:30.897
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

00:46:31.216 --> 00:46:33.196
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up and…

00:46:34.839 --> 00:46:36.567
he wasn't heard from again.

00:46:37.281 --> 00:46:39.187
They're not gonna do that to us.

00:46:39.493 --> 00:46:40.517
I'm gonna get everything back.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.728
Come on, please.

00:46:41.811 --> 00:46:43.372
Let me contact one of my colleagues.

00:46:43.455 --> 00:46:45.842
He's had some dealings
with these people before.

00:46:46.168 --> 00:46:47.458
I'll e-mail him and…

00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:48.938
maybe he can help.

00:46:49.429 --> 00:46:51.197
They took your laptop, too.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.414
I need a horse!

00:47:44.253 --> 00:47:45.500
We don't have horses.

00:47:45.583 --> 00:47:47.465
Just dogs, cats, birds…

00:47:47.548 --> 00:47:49.903
Then give me one of those
large enough to ride.

00:47:50.293 --> 00:47:52.554
Hey, you still need a lift?

00:47:57.183 --> 00:47:59.905
I've never done anything
like this before.

00:48:01.229 --> 00:48:04.446
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

00:48:04.691 --> 00:48:06.229
Many times.

00:48:07.026 --> 00:48:08.528
But you're brave to do it.

00:48:08.611 --> 00:48:11.156
Well, they just stole
my entire life's work.

00:48:11.239 --> 00:48:13.232
I don't really have much left to lose.

00:48:14.534 --> 00:48:16.032
Yeah, but you're clever.

00:48:16.619 --> 00:48:19.348
Far more clever than anyone else
in this realm.

00:48:19.789 --> 00:48:20.925
Realm?

00:48:21.348 --> 00:48:22.500
Realm?

00:48:22.583 --> 00:48:25.122
You think me strange.
Yeah, I do.

00:48:25.878 --> 00:48:27.186
Good strange or…

00:48:27.269 --> 00:48:28.394
bad strange?

00:48:28.477 --> 00:48:30.475
I'm not quite sure yet.

00:48:35.388 --> 00:48:37.102
I'm sorry.

00:48:42.186 --> 00:48:43.612
But who are you?

00:48:45.565 --> 00:48:46.987
Really?

00:48:49.444 --> 00:48:51.166
You'll see soon enough.

00:48:51.859 --> 00:48:53.741
You promised me answers.

00:48:56.993 --> 00:48:59.079
What you seek, it's a bridge.

00:48:59.162 --> 00:49:01.049
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

00:49:01.132 --> 00:49:02.784
More like a Rainbow Bridge.

00:49:05.585 --> 00:49:07.732
God, I hope you're not crazy.

00:49:14.094 --> 00:49:17.113
The Führer is not accustomed
to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.

00:49:17.196 --> 00:49:19.755
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

00:49:19.838 --> 00:49:21.792
You serve at his pleasure.

00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:24.728
He gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries.

00:49:24.811 --> 00:49:27.341
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

00:49:27.424 --> 00:49:30.267
I no longer reflect his image
of Aryan perfection.

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:32.568
You think this is about appearances?

00:49:32.705 --> 00:49:34.489
Your Hydra division has failed…

00:49:34.572 --> 00:49:36.999
to deliver so much
as a rifle in over a year.

00:49:37.082 --> 00:49:39.705
And we had learned
through local intelligence…

00:49:39.788 --> 00:49:42.813
you had mounted a full-scale
incursion into Norway.

00:49:42.896 --> 00:49:44.792
The Führer feels, how does he put it?

00:49:44.875 --> 00:49:47.960
The Red Skull has been
indulged long enough.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.702
Gentlemen…

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:07.855
you have come to see
the results of our work.

00:50:08.982 --> 00:50:10.579
Let me show you.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.757
Hitler speaks of a 1000-year Reich…

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.766
but he cannot feed his armies
for a month.

00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:20.102
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe…

00:50:20.322 --> 00:50:21.884
but still he is no,.

00:50:21.967 --> 00:50:24.324
Closer to achieving his goals.

00:50:24.741 --> 00:50:28.341
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?

00:50:28.778 --> 00:50:29.763
Science.

00:50:29.846 --> 00:50:32.726
But I understand your confusion.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:35.974
Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

00:50:36.057 --> 00:50:40.163
Hydra is assembling an arsenal
to destroy my enemies in one stroke…

00:50:40.246 --> 00:50:41.503
wherever they are…

00:50:41.586 --> 00:50:43.636
regardless of how many
forces they possess…

00:50:43.719 --> 00:50:45.191
all in a matter of hours.

00:50:45.274 --> 00:50:46.299
Your enemies?

00:50:46.382 --> 00:50:49.236
My weapons contain
enough destructive power…

00:50:49.319 --> 00:50:52.600
to decimate every hostile capital on Earth.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.287
Quite simply, gentlemen…

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.583
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

00:51:01.468 --> 00:51:02.599
Thank you, Schmidt.

00:51:02.682 --> 00:51:04.058
For what?

00:51:04.193 --> 00:51:07.241
For making it clear
how obviously mad you are.

00:51:07.324 --> 00:51:09.224
Berlin is on this map.

00:51:09.742 --> 00:51:11.104
So it is.

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:15.961
You will be punished
for your insolence.

00:51:16.044 --> 00:51:18.908
You will be brought before
the Führer himself.

00:51:27.827 --> 00:51:29.429
Schmidt…

00:51:34.767 --> 00:51:36.618
My apologies, Doctor…

00:51:36.701 --> 00:51:41.863
but we both knew Hydra could grow
no further in Hitler's shadow.

00:51:43.384 --> 00:51:44.708
Hail Hydra.

00:51:44.978 --> 00:51:46.837
Hail Hydra.

00:51:51.369 --> 00:51:52.841
Hail Hydra.
