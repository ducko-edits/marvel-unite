WEBVTT

00:00:58.015 --> 00:00:59.335
Wait for it.

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:01.855
Can I turn on the radio?

00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:02.935
No.

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:09.255
Jane, you can't keep doing this.

00:01:10.255 --> 00:01:14.055
The last 17 occurrences have
been predictable to the second.

00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:16.695
Jane, you're an astrophysicist,
not some storm chaser.

00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:18.575
I'm telling you,
there's a connection

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:21.455
between these atmospheric
disturbances and my research.

00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:23.575
Erik, I wouldn't have asked you

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:26.135
to fly out here if I
wasn't absolutely sure.

00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:27.575
Jane?

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:29.535
I think you want to see this.

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:35.135
What is that?

00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:45.135
I thought you said it
was a subtle aurora!

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:46.455
Go!

00:01:53.335 --> 00:01:54.495
Get closer.

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:55.655
Right. Good one.

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:56.815
Go!

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:15.855
What are you doing?

00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:19.015
I am not dying for
six college credits!

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:41.895
I think that was
legally your fault.

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:43.535
Get the first aid kit.

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:45.255
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:46.655
Please.

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:53.495
Where did he come from?

00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:29.836
Stop him!

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:36.516
What are you doing?
Buddy, are you all right?

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:38.196
Hey, this guy's been shot!

00:04:49.436 --> 00:04:50.476
I had him!

00:04:51.076 --> 00:04:52.756
Sorry!

00:05:12.596 --> 00:05:13.996
I'm sorry!

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:24.076
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:29.116
No! No! Not my son!

00:06:30.036 --> 00:06:31.516
- Stop it!
- Don't hurt him!

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:34.796
Get back!

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:37.276
Let me go!

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:39.916
No!

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:41.756
Let go of my son!

00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:45.716
Don't hurt him!

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.796
Wait, don't! Don't!

00:06:53.516 --> 00:06:54.596
No! Don't!

00:07:00.636 --> 00:07:02.636
Go get him! I can swim!

00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:57.156
- Who the hell are you?
- The first of many.

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:59.236
Cut off one head,

00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:03.076
two more shall take its place.

00:08:05.556 --> 00:08:07.436
Hail Hydra.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.120
Open it!

00:09:36.948 --> 00:09:38.548
Quickly, before he...

00:09:50.603 --> 00:09:54.443
It has taken me a long
time to find this place.

00:09:57.103 --> 00:09:58.863
You should be commended.

00:09:58.888 --> 00:09:59.968
Help him up.

00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:07.708
I think that you are
a man of great vision.

00:10:07.948 --> 00:10:10.228
And, in this way,
we are much alike.

00:10:10.268 --> 00:10:11.748
I am nothing like you.

00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:13.428
No, of course, but

00:10:14.028 --> 00:10:15.748
what others see as superstition,

00:10:15.828 --> 00:10:19.028
you and I know to be a science.

00:10:19.588 --> 00:10:21.428
What you seek is just a legend.

00:10:21.468 --> 00:10:24.028
Then why make such
an effort to conceal it?

00:10:44.388 --> 00:10:49.228
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

00:10:54.268 --> 00:10:56.948
It is not something one buries.

00:10:57.628 --> 00:11:01.748
But I think it is close, yes?

00:11:02.468 --> 00:11:03.788
I cannot help you.

00:11:04.068 --> 00:11:08.508
No. But maybe you
can help your village.

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:10.628
You must have
some friends out there.

00:11:10.708 --> 00:11:13.908
Some little
grandchildren, perhaps?

00:11:14.588 --> 00:11:16.988
I have no need for them to die.

00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:32.748
Yggdrasil.

00:11:33.508 --> 00:11:35.988
Tree of the world.

00:11:37.828 --> 00:11:39.988
Guardian of wisdom.

00:11:41.908 --> 00:11:43.908
And fate, also.

00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:19.548
And the <i>Fuhrer</i> digs
for trinkets in the desert.

00:12:22.948 --> 00:12:25.948
You have never
seen this, have you?

00:12:26.388 --> 00:12:30.028
It's not for the eyes
of ordinary men.

00:12:30.228 --> 00:12:31.708
Exactly.

00:12:35.068 --> 00:12:38.148
Give the order to open fire.

00:12:38.228 --> 00:12:39.588
Fool!

00:12:40.228 --> 00:12:42.548
You cannot control
the power you hold.

00:12:42.588 --> 00:12:43.668
You will burn!

00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:46.508
I already have.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:02.964
I think that was
legally your fault.

00:13:03.153 --> 00:13:04.793
Get the first aid kit.

00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:06.212
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

00:13:11.746 --> 00:13:14.666
Whoa. Does he need CPR?
Because I totally know CPR.

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.743
Where did he come from?

00:13:32.623 --> 00:13:33.623
You all right?

00:13:33.783 --> 00:13:34.783
Hammer?

00:13:35.103 --> 00:13:36.103
Hammer?

00:13:36.143 --> 00:13:39.063
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
It's pretty obvious.

00:13:39.183 --> 00:13:41.343
Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!

00:13:41.463 --> 00:13:44.263
We have to move quickly
before this all changes.

00:13:45.263 --> 00:13:46.943
Jane, we have to
take him to the hospital.

00:13:47.143 --> 00:13:48.303
Father!

00:13:48.383 --> 00:13:49.463
He's fine, look at him.

00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:53.583
Heimdall! I know you can hear me!
Open the Bifrost!

00:13:53.623 --> 00:13:55.583
Hospital. You go, I'll stay.

00:13:55.623 --> 00:13:58.143
You. What realm is this?

00:13:58.263 --> 00:13:59.783
Alfheim? Nornheim?

00:13:59.863 --> 00:14:00.863
New Mexico?

00:14:01.103 --> 00:14:04.423
You dare threaten me, Thor,
with so puny a weapon?

00:14:08.823 --> 00:14:10.823
What? He was freaking me out!

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:13.263
Next time you decide
to taser somebody,

00:14:13.343 --> 00:14:15.783
make sure he's
already in the car, okay?

00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:19.023
Jane! Come on.

00:14:36.903 --> 00:14:38.143
Name?

00:14:38.183 --> 00:14:40.703
He said it was Thor?

00:14:40.863 --> 00:14:44.063
T-H-O-R.

00:14:44.503 --> 00:14:46.023
And your relationship to him?

00:14:46.063 --> 00:14:47.183
I've never met him before.

00:14:47.223 --> 00:14:48.743
Until she hit him with a car.

00:14:48.863 --> 00:14:51.543
I grazed him, but
she tasered him.

00:14:51.863 --> 00:14:53.183
Yes, I did.

00:14:54.863 --> 00:14:55.863
Hi.

00:14:57.223 --> 00:14:58.343
Just taking a little blood.

00:14:58.503 --> 00:15:00.743
How dare you attack
the son of Odin?

00:15:00.863 --> 00:15:02.703
I need some help!

00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:05.383
Call security!

00:15:05.583 --> 00:15:07.743
Security to ER 3, stat!

00:15:21.583 --> 00:15:23.743
You're no match
for the Mighty...

00:16:16.303 --> 00:16:17.423
Huh.

00:16:24.148 --> 00:16:26.428
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

00:16:37.308 --> 00:16:40.148
Well, that... That went well.

00:16:40.228 --> 00:16:42.668
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

00:16:42.748 --> 00:16:45.068
Your head? What about my head?

00:16:45.148 --> 00:16:48.148
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

00:16:48.228 --> 00:16:49.828
Uh, optimistically, 40 points.

00:16:49.868 --> 00:16:51.348
At minimum.

00:16:51.748 --> 00:16:52.748
Yep.

00:16:53.068 --> 00:16:56.348
Tony, we're a
weapons manufacturer.

00:16:56.428 --> 00:16:59.108
Obie, I just don't want a body
count to be our only legacy.

00:16:59.188 --> 00:17:01.788
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

00:17:01.828 --> 00:17:03.028
It's my name on the
side of the building.

00:17:03.108 --> 00:17:05.708
And what we do keeps the
world from falling into chaos.

00:17:05.788 --> 00:17:07.748
Not based on what I saw.

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:10.028
We're not doing a
good enough job.

00:17:10.068 --> 00:17:11.348
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

00:17:11.388 --> 00:17:12.588
Like what?

00:17:12.708 --> 00:17:14.068
You want us to
make baby bottles?

00:17:15.308 --> 00:17:18.548
I think we should take another
look into arc reactor technology.

00:17:18.668 --> 00:17:22.988
Ah, come on. The arc reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:26.468
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

00:17:26.548 --> 00:17:29.668
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

00:17:30.108 --> 00:17:31.628
The arc was never
cost effective.

00:17:31.708 --> 00:17:33.428
We knew that before we built it.

00:17:33.508 --> 00:17:36.668
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

00:17:36.708 --> 00:17:37.868
Maybe.

00:17:38.028 --> 00:17:40.908
Huh? Am I right? We haven't
had a breakthrough in that in what?

00:17:41.028 --> 00:17:43.548
- 30 years.
- That's what they say.

00:17:46.188 --> 00:17:48.388
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

00:17:48.468 --> 00:17:51.708
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:54.108
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.028
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:18:07.268 --> 00:18:08.588
It works.

00:18:12.588 --> 00:18:16.788
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

00:18:16.868 --> 00:18:20.148
There's nothing we can't
do if we stick together,

00:18:20.228 --> 00:18:21.628
like your father and I.

00:18:21.708 --> 00:18:23.508
I'm sorry I didn't give
you a heads-up, okay?

00:18:23.588 --> 00:18:25.188
- But if I had...
- Tony.

00:18:25.268 --> 00:18:28.268
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

00:18:28.348 --> 00:18:31.108
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

00:18:31.668 --> 00:18:33.868
You gotta let me handle this.

00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:36.348
We're gonna have to play a
whole different kind of ball now.

00:18:36.428 --> 00:18:38.268
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

00:18:38.308 --> 00:18:41.588
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

00:18:41.868 --> 00:18:43.628
<i>Stark Industries!</i>

00:18:43.708 --> 00:18:46.588
<i>I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?</i>

00:18:46.628 --> 00:18:47.788
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:49.988
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

00:18:50.068 --> 00:18:53.468
<i>Does the Hindenburg
ring any bells?</i>

00:18:54.788 --> 00:18:59.748
<i>Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!</i>

00:19:01.388 --> 00:19:04.668
<i>Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!</i>

00:19:05.828 --> 00:19:08.668
<i>Pepper. How big are your hands?</i>

00:19:09.188 --> 00:19:11.428
- What?
<i>- How big are your hands?</i>

00:19:11.468 --> 00:19:14.388
- I don't understand why...
<i>- Get down here. I need you.</i>

00:19:21.788 --> 00:19:22.828
Hey.

00:19:24.868 --> 00:19:27.388
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.

00:19:27.508 --> 00:19:28.468
Let's see them.

00:19:28.828 --> 00:19:30.908
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

00:19:31.828 --> 00:19:34.388
I just need your help for a sec.

00:19:35.148 --> 00:19:37.388
Oh, my God, is that the
thing that's keeping you alive?

00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:39.988
It was. It is now an antique.

00:19:40.828 --> 00:19:43.628
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.

00:19:43.668 --> 00:19:45.668
I'm swapping it up
for an upgraded unit,

00:19:45.748 --> 00:19:47.988
and I just ran into
a little speed bump.

00:19:48.548 --> 00:19:49.988
Speed bump, what does that mean?

00:19:50.028 --> 00:19:51.348
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

00:19:51.428 --> 00:19:54.788
There's an exposed
wire under this device.

00:19:54.868 --> 00:19:58.028
And it's contacting the socket
wall and causing a little bit of a short.

00:19:58.068 --> 00:19:59.748
It's fine.

00:20:00.628 --> 00:20:02.548
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

00:20:02.628 --> 00:20:04.428
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

00:20:04.508 --> 00:20:08.828
I want you to reach in, and you're
just gonna gently lift the wire out.

00:20:09.628 --> 00:20:11.708
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

00:20:11.748 --> 00:20:13.428
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

00:20:13.508 --> 00:20:14.868
the socket wall
or it goes "beep."

00:20:14.908 --> 00:20:16.028
What do you mean, "Operation"?

00:20:16.068 --> 00:20:17.428
It's just a game, never mind.

00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:21.548
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:25.868
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

00:20:25.908 --> 00:20:29.988
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

00:20:30.068 --> 00:20:33.588
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

00:20:34.868 --> 00:20:36.868
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

00:20:36.908 --> 00:20:39.588
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

00:20:39.668 --> 00:20:40.828
Okay.

00:20:45.108 --> 00:20:46.748
Oh, there's pus!

00:20:46.828 --> 00:20:51.428
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

00:20:51.548 --> 00:20:53.428
- not from my body.
- It smells!

00:20:53.548 --> 00:20:55.068
Yeah, it does.

00:20:55.428 --> 00:20:56.708
The copper wire.

00:20:56.828 --> 00:20:58.108
The copper wire, you got it?

00:20:58.188 --> 00:20:59.348
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

00:20:59.428 --> 00:21:00.428
Now, don't let it

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:02.348
touch the sides when
you're coming out!

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:03.428
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:21:03.468 --> 00:21:04.828
That's what I was
trying to tell you before.

00:21:04.908 --> 00:21:07.108
Okay, now make sure that
when you pull it out, you don't...

00:21:07.108 --> 00:21:09.028
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it.

00:21:09.108 --> 00:21:10.108
You just pulled it out.

00:21:10.188 --> 00:21:11.348
- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

00:21:11.428 --> 00:21:13.588
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

00:21:13.628 --> 00:21:14.668
What's wrong?

00:21:14.748 --> 00:21:17.388
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

00:21:17.428 --> 00:21:20.348
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

00:21:20.428 --> 00:21:22.428
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

00:21:22.708 --> 00:21:24.548
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

00:21:24.588 --> 00:21:25.588
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

00:21:25.668 --> 00:21:28.348
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

00:21:28.868 --> 00:21:32.988
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

00:21:37.068 --> 00:21:39.468
Was that so hard?
That was fun, right?

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:41.268
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

00:21:41.788 --> 00:21:42.828
Nice.

00:21:42.908 --> 00:21:45.188
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

00:21:45.268 --> 00:21:46.508
You okay?

00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:50.828
Don't ever, ever, ever,

00:21:50.908 --> 00:21:53.908
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

00:21:53.988 --> 00:21:56.148
I don't have anyone but you.

00:22:01.748 --> 00:22:02.788
Anyway...

00:22:08.628 --> 00:22:10.108
What do you want
me to do with this?

00:22:10.148 --> 00:22:11.588
That?

00:22:12.348 --> 00:22:13.748
Destroy it.

00:22:14.268 --> 00:22:15.788
Incinerate it.

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:18.068
You don't want to keep it?

00:22:18.148 --> 00:22:22.308
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

00:22:22.828 --> 00:22:24.228
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

00:22:24.348 --> 00:22:26.108
That will be all, Miss Potts.

00:22:27.268 --> 00:22:28.988
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

00:22:29.108 --> 00:22:30.988
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

00:22:31.108 --> 00:22:34.308
That's my phone, that's a
picture of me and my dad.

00:22:34.348 --> 00:22:37.308
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

00:22:56.701 --> 00:22:58.861
Are you ready, Dr. Zola?

00:23:00.261 --> 00:23:03.941
My machine requires the
most delicate calibration.

00:23:05.541 --> 00:23:07.581
Forgive me if I
seem overcautious.

00:23:08.141 --> 00:23:10.301
Are you certain that
those conductors of yours

00:23:10.341 --> 00:23:14.461
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?

00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:16.141
With this artifact

00:23:16.741 --> 00:23:18.141
I am certain of nothing.

00:23:18.381 --> 00:23:20.821
I fear it may not work at all.

00:23:57.861 --> 00:23:59.141
Twenty percent.

00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:02.661
Forty.

00:24:05.341 --> 00:24:06.741
Sixty.

00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:11.461
Stabilizing at 70%.

00:24:13.621 --> 00:24:17.261
I have not come all this
way for safety, Doctor.

00:24:35.781 --> 00:24:37.381
What was that?

00:24:37.981 --> 00:24:41.101
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

00:24:41.181 --> 00:24:44.381
Your designs do not disappoint.

00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:48.781
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

00:24:49.501 --> 00:24:51.781
The exchange is stable.

00:24:52.301 --> 00:24:53.821
Amazing!

00:24:54.421 --> 00:24:56.541
The energy we
have just collected

00:24:56.581 --> 00:24:59.581
could power my designs.
All my designs.

00:25:01.701 --> 00:25:04.541
This will change the war.

00:25:05.221 --> 00:25:06.981
Dr. Zola,

00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:11.341
this will change the world.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.870
<i>You don't think this was just
a magnetic storm, do you?</i>

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:25.870
Look, the lensing
around these edges

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.350
is characteristic of an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.670
A what?

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.750
I thought you were
a science major?

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:31.830
Political science.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.710
She was the only applicant.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.470
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:37.830
between two different
points of space-time.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.190
It's a wormhole.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.190
Erik, look. What do you see?

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.310
Stars.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.190
Yeah, but not our stars.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.190
See, this is the star alignment

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.030
for our quadrant
this time of year,

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:51.270
and unless Ursa Minor
decided to take a day off,

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.550
these are someone
else's constellations.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:55.510
Hey! Check this out.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.070
No, it can't be.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.230
I think I left something
at the hospital.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.870
It's not possible!

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.270
He was on drugs or something.
He just went nuts.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.550
Oh, my God.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:58.110
I just lost my most
important piece of evidence.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.230
Typical.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:00.350
So now what?

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.430
We find him.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.950
Did you see what
he did in there?

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.790
I'm not sure finding
him is the best idea.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.230
Well, our data can't tell us what
it was like to be inside that event,

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.950
and he can.
So, we're gonna find him.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.110
Okay.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.790
So we're gonna look all
over New Mexico, right?

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.270
Exactly.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:20.510
What?

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.750
I'm so sorry.
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.430
I got it, I got it.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.030
Come on, kick it in now!

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:04.950
Did it work?

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.870
Sir, we found it.

00:28:32.547 --> 00:28:35.227
Next. Up.

00:28:35.867 --> 00:28:38.787
Not in the boot, Dummy.
Right here. You got me?

00:28:38.867 --> 00:28:40.947
Stay put. Nice.

00:28:42.747 --> 00:28:46.587
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

00:28:47.067 --> 00:28:49.227
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?

00:28:56.107 --> 00:28:57.307
Up.

00:28:58.147 --> 00:28:59.987
Screw it. Don't even move.

00:29:00.067 --> 00:29:03.107
You are a tragedy.

00:29:12.947 --> 00:29:15.587
<i>Okay, let's do this right.</i>

00:29:16.227 --> 00:29:19.067
<i>Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.</i>

00:29:21.827 --> 00:29:24.027
<i>Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.</i>

00:29:24.067 --> 00:29:25.547
You, roll it.

00:29:27.867 --> 00:29:31.427
<i>Okay. Activate hand controls.</i>

00:29:35.747 --> 00:29:36.907
<i>We're gonna start
off nice and easy.</i>

00:29:36.987 --> 00:29:40.187
<i>We're gonna see if 10%
thrust capacity achieves lift.</i>

00:29:40.267 --> 00:29:41.587
<i>And three,</i>

00:29:42.427 --> 00:29:43.467
<i>two,</i>

00:29:44.267 --> 00:29:45.427
<i>one.</i>

00:30:22.467 --> 00:30:24.827
Up two. All right, set that.

00:30:24.907 --> 00:30:27.307
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

00:30:27.347 --> 00:30:29.227
Yeah, everything's... What?

00:30:29.307 --> 00:30:30.467
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

00:30:30.507 --> 00:30:32.587
What would you like me to tell him?
Great. I'll be right up.

00:30:33.027 --> 00:30:34.267
Okay.

00:30:35.027 --> 00:30:36.867
I thought you said you
were done making weapons.

00:30:36.947 --> 00:30:37.947
It is.

00:30:38.427 --> 00:30:41.987
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

00:30:46.027 --> 00:30:47.307
I didn't expect that.

00:30:52.587 --> 00:30:54.027
How'd it go?

00:30:56.267 --> 00:30:57.947
It went that bad, huh?

00:30:58.027 --> 00:31:00.667
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York

00:31:00.707 --> 00:31:04.627
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Uh-huh. Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

00:31:04.667 --> 00:31:07.587
It would have gone better
if you were there. Uh-uh.

00:31:07.867 --> 00:31:09.387
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:11.747
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on.

00:31:11.827 --> 00:31:14.027
In public. The press.

00:31:15.067 --> 00:31:17.587
This was a board
of directors meeting.

00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:19.707
This was a board
of directors meeting?

00:31:20.307 --> 00:31:22.787
The board is claiming you
have posttraumatic stress.

00:31:22.867 --> 00:31:23.987
They're filing an injunction.

00:31:24.027 --> 00:31:26.107
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

00:31:26.187 --> 00:31:27.427
Why, 'cause the
stocks dipped 40 points?

00:31:27.507 --> 00:31:28.507
We knew that was gonna happen.

00:31:28.547 --> 00:31:30.667
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

00:31:30.707 --> 00:31:32.947
We own the controlling
interest in the company.

00:31:33.027 --> 00:31:35.787
Tony, the board has rights, too.

00:31:36.667 --> 00:31:40.547
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

00:31:40.587 --> 00:31:42.907
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

00:31:42.947 --> 00:31:45.987
That's a new direction
for me, for the company.

00:31:46.907 --> 00:31:50.787
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:51.907
This is great.

00:31:51.947 --> 00:31:55.427
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

00:31:55.547 --> 00:31:57.747
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

00:31:57.787 --> 00:32:01.147
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

00:32:01.227 --> 00:32:02.827
Something to pitch them.

00:32:02.907 --> 00:32:06.427
Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

00:32:06.467 --> 00:32:08.627
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

00:32:08.707 --> 00:32:10.307
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

00:32:10.387 --> 00:32:11.427
That's it, Obie. Forget it.

00:32:11.467 --> 00:32:13.227
All right, well, this
stays with me, then.

00:32:13.267 --> 00:32:15.147
Go on, here, you
can have a piece.

00:32:15.227 --> 00:32:16.707
- Take two.
- Thank you.

00:32:16.747 --> 00:32:18.667
You mind if I come down
there and see what you're doing?

00:32:18.747 --> 00:32:20.387
Good night, Obie.

00:32:34.314 --> 00:32:37.194
Is there something
in particular you need?

00:32:43.034 --> 00:32:45.874
I understand you found him.

00:32:46.674 --> 00:32:48.354
See for yourself.

00:33:00.434 --> 00:33:01.994
You disapprove.

00:33:02.634 --> 00:33:05.754
I just don't see why you
need concern yourself.

00:33:05.754 --> 00:33:07.554
I can't imagine he will succeed.

00:33:10.554 --> 00:33:11.794
Again.

00:33:12.154 --> 00:33:16.194
His serum is the Allies' only defense
against this power we now possess.

00:33:16.234 --> 00:33:19.914
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

00:33:23.074 --> 00:33:24.754
Shall I give the order?

00:33:25.794 --> 00:33:27.754
It has been given.

00:33:29.914 --> 00:33:31.274
Good.

00:33:33.874 --> 00:33:34.874
Dr. Zola!

00:33:39.154 --> 00:33:40.474
What do you think?

00:33:47.314 --> 00:33:49.274
A masterpiece.

00:34:02.497 --> 00:34:06.857
You know, for a crazy
homeless person, he's pretty cut.

00:34:09.959 --> 00:34:11.959
Hey, sorry I tased you!

00:34:14.439 --> 00:34:16.439
Excuse me, excuse me!

00:34:23.759 --> 00:34:25.159
What is this?

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:26.679
Oh.

00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:29.319
My ex.

00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:33.919
Good with patients and
bad with relationships.

00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:36.399
They're the only clothes
I had that would fit you.

00:34:36.439 --> 00:34:37.479
They will suffice.

00:34:38.599 --> 00:34:39.599
You're welcome.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:41.559
This mortal form has grown weak.

00:34:41.999 --> 00:34:43.079
I need sustenance.

00:34:48.808 --> 00:34:50.608
How'd you get inside that cloud?

00:34:50.808 --> 00:34:53.328
Also, how could you eat
an entire box of Pop-Tarts

00:34:53.448 --> 00:34:54.968
and still be this hungry?

00:35:00.808 --> 00:35:01.968
This drink, I like it.

00:35:02.008 --> 00:35:03.128
I know. It's great, right?

00:35:03.248 --> 00:35:04.328
Another!

00:35:05.688 --> 00:35:08.048
Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:12.048
What was that?

00:35:12.128 --> 00:35:13.128
It was delicious.
I want another.

00:35:13.168 --> 00:35:14.288
Well, you could
have just said so.

00:35:14.368 --> 00:35:15.448
I just did.

00:35:15.528 --> 00:35:17.208
No, I mean, ask nicely.

00:35:17.328 --> 00:35:18.928
I meant no disrespect.

00:35:18.968 --> 00:35:20.088
All right.
Well, no more smashing.

00:35:20.608 --> 00:35:21.648
Deal?

00:35:24.128 --> 00:35:25.168
You have my word.

00:35:26.368 --> 00:35:27.448
Good.

00:35:28.808 --> 00:35:30.648
The usual, please, Izzy.

00:35:30.808 --> 00:35:33.328
You missed all the
excitement out at the crater.

00:35:33.688 --> 00:35:36.848
They're saying some kind of
satellite landed out in the desert.

00:35:36.848 --> 00:35:39.088
Yeah, we were having
a good time with it

00:35:39.168 --> 00:35:40.528
until the Feds showed up.

00:35:40.648 --> 00:35:43.488
Excuse me.
Did you say there was a satellite crash?

00:35:43.528 --> 00:35:44.608
Yeah.

00:35:44.688 --> 00:35:47.128
Oh, my God.
This is going on Facebook. Smile.

00:35:49.488 --> 00:35:51.368
What did it look
like, the satellite?

00:35:52.208 --> 00:35:55.808
I don't know anything about
satellites, but it was heavy.

00:35:55.888 --> 00:35:59.408
I mean, nobody could lift it.

00:35:59.528 --> 00:36:02.208
They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.

00:36:02.408 --> 00:36:03.888
Which way?

00:36:06.048 --> 00:36:08.048
Fifty miles west of here.

00:36:08.408 --> 00:36:10.168
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

00:36:10.208 --> 00:36:11.968
Looked like the whole Army
was coming when we left.

00:36:17.048 --> 00:36:18.368
Dumbass!

00:36:19.208 --> 00:36:20.528
Where are you going?

00:36:20.928 --> 00:36:22.288
Fifty miles west of here.

00:36:22.368 --> 00:36:23.368
Why?

00:36:23.448 --> 00:36:24.688
To get what belongs to me.

00:36:24.808 --> 00:36:26.408
Oh, so you own a satellite now?

00:36:26.528 --> 00:36:27.528
It's not what they say it is.

00:36:27.568 --> 00:36:28.688
Well, whatever it is,

00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:30.048
the government
seems to think it's theirs.

00:36:30.168 --> 00:36:32.208
So, you just intend to
go in there and take it?

00:36:32.248 --> 00:36:33.368
Yes.

00:36:34.848 --> 00:36:36.048
If you take me there now,

00:36:36.088 --> 00:36:37.888
I'll tell you everything
you wish to know.

00:36:37.968 --> 00:36:39.408
- Everything?
- Yes.

00:36:39.448 --> 00:36:42.208
All the answers you seek will
be yours once I reclaim Mjolnir.

00:36:42.368 --> 00:36:44.408
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?

00:36:44.448 --> 00:36:46.408
Can I have a word, Jane?

00:36:50.448 --> 00:36:51.928
Please don't do this.

00:36:52.408 --> 00:36:54.128
You saw what I saw last night.

00:36:54.248 --> 00:36:56.608
This is no coincidence.
We have to find out what's in that crater.

00:36:56.728 --> 00:36:58.688
But I'm not talking about the
crater, I'm talking about him.

00:36:58.728 --> 00:37:00.088
But he's promising
us the answers.

00:37:00.168 --> 00:37:01.448
He's delusional.

00:37:01.568 --> 00:37:02.568
Listen to what he's saying.

00:37:02.688 --> 00:37:06.568
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

00:37:06.928 --> 00:37:09.128
It's the stories I grew
up with as a child.

00:37:09.248 --> 00:37:12.088
I'm just going to drive him.
That's it.

00:37:12.248 --> 00:37:14.248
He's dangerous, Jane.

00:37:20.208 --> 00:37:23.088
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

00:37:23.208 --> 00:37:24.648
Then this is where
we say goodbye.

00:37:31.368 --> 00:37:32.368
Um...

00:37:35.128 --> 00:37:36.768
Thank you?

00:37:37.568 --> 00:37:39.288
Jane Foster,

00:37:39.408 --> 00:37:40.968
Erik Selvig,

00:37:41.088 --> 00:37:42.568
Darcy,

00:37:42.768 --> 00:37:44.128
farewell.

00:37:47.728 --> 00:37:49.088
All right.

00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:51.288
Back to work.

00:38:10.208 --> 00:38:11.648
Hey!

00:38:11.768 --> 00:38:13.328
That's my stuff!

00:38:18.048 --> 00:38:19.688
What the hell is going on here?

00:38:19.768 --> 00:38:21.448
Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson
with S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:38:21.488 --> 00:38:23.168
Is that supposed to
mean something to me?

00:38:23.288 --> 00:38:24.528
You can't do this! Jane!

00:38:24.968 --> 00:38:27.808
Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realize. Let it go.

00:38:27.848 --> 00:38:29.888
Let it go? This is my life.

00:38:30.168 --> 00:38:32.208
We're investigating
a security threat.

00:38:32.328 --> 00:38:35.008
We need to appropriate your
records and all your atmospheric data.

00:38:35.128 --> 00:38:37.488
By "appropriate,"
do you mean steal?

00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:39.328
Here, this should more
than compensate you

00:38:39.368 --> 00:38:40.368
for your trouble.

00:38:40.528 --> 00:38:43.048
I can't just buy
replacements at Radio Shack,

00:38:43.168 --> 00:38:44.848
I made most of this
equipment myself!

00:38:44.968 --> 00:38:46.288
Then I'm sure
you can do it again.

00:38:46.368 --> 00:38:49.528
And I'm sure I can sue you for
violating my constitutional rights!

00:38:49.568 --> 00:38:52.048
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster,
but we're the good guys.

00:38:52.208 --> 00:38:54.248
So are we!

00:38:54.368 --> 00:38:57.528
I'm on the verge of understanding
something extraordinary.

00:38:57.648 --> 00:38:59.408
And everything I know
about this phenomenon

00:38:59.528 --> 00:39:01.368
is either in this
lab or in this book.

00:39:01.488 --> 00:39:04.208
And you can't just
take this away... Hey!

00:39:05.088 --> 00:39:08.048
Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...

00:39:10.488 --> 00:39:12.328
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:39:21.894 --> 00:39:26.734
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

00:39:26.814 --> 00:39:29.454
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:32.374
and I'm not on fire, I'm
donating you to a city college.

00:39:32.454 --> 00:39:34.294
<i>All right, nice and easy.</i>

00:39:34.374 --> 00:39:39.294
<i>Seriously, just gonna start
off with 1% thrust capacity.</i>

00:39:40.814 --> 00:39:42.934
<i>And three, two, one.</i>

00:39:54.734 --> 00:39:55.774
Okay.

00:39:57.094 --> 00:39:58.694
Please don't follow
me around with it, either,

00:39:58.774 --> 00:40:01.214
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

00:40:01.294 --> 00:40:03.014
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

00:40:03.054 --> 00:40:05.334
And again, let's
bring it up to 2.5.

00:40:05.374 --> 00:40:07.014
Three, two, one.

00:40:23.614 --> 00:40:26.174
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be!

00:40:26.254 --> 00:40:27.614
Oh, not the car, not the car!

00:40:28.934 --> 00:40:29.934
Table!

00:40:41.054 --> 00:40:45.174
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

00:41:03.254 --> 00:41:04.774
No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Uh!

00:41:06.854 --> 00:41:08.534
Yeah, I can fly.

00:41:13.294 --> 00:41:16.254
- Jarvis, are you there?
<i>- At your service, sir.</i>

00:41:16.334 --> 00:41:17.414
Engage Heads Up Display.

00:41:17.494 --> 00:41:18.574
<i>Check.</i>

00:41:18.614 --> 00:41:20.694
Import all preferences
from home interface.

00:41:20.734 --> 00:41:22.254
<i>Will do, sir.</i>

00:41:29.174 --> 00:41:30.214
All right, what do you say?

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:33.774
<i>I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.</i>

00:41:33.894 --> 00:41:35.494
Can we start the
virtual walk-around?

00:41:35.614 --> 00:41:38.614
<i>Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.</i>

00:41:38.654 --> 00:41:39.974
Do a check on control surfaces.

00:41:40.054 --> 00:41:41.614
<i>As you wish.</i>

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:06.054
<i>Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.</i>

00:42:06.134 --> 00:42:09.054
Uh, yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

00:42:09.134 --> 00:42:10.614
Start listening in
on ground control.

00:42:10.654 --> 00:42:11.814
<i>Sir, there are still terabytes</i>

00:42:11.854 --> 00:42:14.454
<i>of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...</i>

00:42:14.534 --> 00:42:18.454
Jarvis! Sometimes you got
to run before you can walk.

00:42:18.574 --> 00:42:22.854
Ready? In three, two, one.

00:42:46.174 --> 00:42:47.974
Handles like a dream.

00:43:16.014 --> 00:43:17.654
All right, let's see
what this thing can do.

00:43:17.694 --> 00:43:19.134
What's SR-71's record?

00:43:19.214 --> 00:43:23.054
<i>The altitude record for fixed
wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.</i>

00:43:23.454 --> 00:43:26.134
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

00:43:29.294 --> 00:43:32.934
<i>Sir, there is a potentially
fatal buildup of ice occurring.</i>

00:43:33.014 --> 00:43:34.094
Keep going!

00:43:36.374 --> 00:43:37.694
Higher!

00:43:51.374 --> 00:43:55.654
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

00:43:58.414 --> 00:44:00.734
Come on, we got
to break the ice!

00:44:35.974 --> 00:44:37.294
Kill power.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:21.130
Years of research,

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:22.170
gone.

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.130
They even took my iPod.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:26.530
What about the backups?

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:27.850
They took our backups.

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:31.650
They took the backups of our backups.
They were extremely thorough.

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:34.050
I just downloaded, like,
30 songs onto there.

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:37.050
Could you please
stop with your iPod?

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:39.730
Who are these people?

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:43.210
I knew this scientist.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.250
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.490
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:51.370
and he wasn't heard from again.

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:54.530
They're not gonna do that to us.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:55.690
I'm gonna get everything back.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.570
Come on, please.
Let me contact one of my colleagues.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.090
He's had some dealings
with these people before.

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:03.850
I'll e-mail him and
maybe he can help.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:06.370
They took your laptop, too.

00:47:56.404 --> 00:47:57.404
I need a horse!

00:47:59.604 --> 00:48:02.764
We don't have horses.
Just dogs, cats, birds...

00:48:02.884 --> 00:48:05.124
Then give me one of
those large enough to ride.

00:48:05.724 --> 00:48:07.924
Hey, you still need a lift?

00:48:12.564 --> 00:48:15.244
I've never done
anything like this before.

00:48:16.564 --> 00:48:19.964
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

00:48:20.084 --> 00:48:21.604
Many times.

00:48:22.404 --> 00:48:23.924
But you're brave to do it.

00:48:23.964 --> 00:48:26.564
Well, they just stole
my entire life's work.

00:48:26.604 --> 00:48:28.564
I don't really have
much left to lose.

00:48:29.924 --> 00:48:30.964
Yeah, but you're clever.

00:48:31.964 --> 00:48:34.924
Far more clever than
anyone else in this realm.

00:48:35.124 --> 00:48:37.564
"Realm"? "Realm"?

00:48:37.924 --> 00:48:39.324
You think me strange.

00:48:39.404 --> 00:48:40.724
Yeah, I do.

00:48:41.284 --> 00:48:43.604
Good strange or bad strange?

00:48:43.764 --> 00:48:45.764
I'm not quite sure yet.

00:48:50.764 --> 00:48:52.444
I'm sorry.

00:48:57.564 --> 00:48:58.644
But who are you?

00:49:00.964 --> 00:49:02.284
Really?

00:49:04.804 --> 00:49:06.244
You'll see soon enough.

00:49:07.164 --> 00:49:08.684
You promised me answers.

00:49:12.324 --> 00:49:14.244
What you seek, it's a bridge.

00:49:14.524 --> 00:49:16.484
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

00:49:16.604 --> 00:49:17.764
More like a Rainbow Bridge.

00:49:20.964 --> 00:49:23.204
God, I hope you're not crazy.

00:49:34.163 --> 00:49:36.843
The <i>Fuhrer</i> is not accustomed
to being ignored, <i>Herr</i> Schmidt.

00:49:36.923 --> 00:49:39.843
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

00:49:39.923 --> 00:49:41.843
You serve at his pleasure.

00:49:41.923 --> 00:49:44.803
He gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries.

00:49:44.883 --> 00:49:47.443
Reward?
Call it what it is. Exile.

00:49:47.523 --> 00:49:50.203
I no longer reflect his
image of Aryan perfection.

00:49:50.283 --> 00:49:52.683
You think this is
about appearances?

00:49:52.763 --> 00:49:54.563
Your Hydra division has failed

00:49:54.643 --> 00:49:57.203
to deliver so much
as a rifle in over a year.

00:49:57.283 --> 00:49:59.683
And we had learned
through local intelligence

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:02.883
you had mounted a full-scale
incursion into Norway.

00:50:02.963 --> 00:50:04.883
The <i>Fuhrer</i> feels...
How does he put it?

00:50:04.963 --> 00:50:08.203
"The Red Skull has been
indulged long enough!"

00:50:20.203 --> 00:50:21.723
Gentlemen,

00:50:24.323 --> 00:50:27.803
you have come to see the
results of our work, hmm?

00:50:29.043 --> 00:50:30.403
Let me show you.

00:50:32.083 --> 00:50:34.723
Hitler speaks of a
1,000-year Reich,

00:50:34.803 --> 00:50:36.723
but he cannot feed
his armies for a month.

00:50:36.803 --> 00:50:40.203
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,

00:50:40.243 --> 00:50:44.323
but still he is no closer
to achieving his goals.

00:50:44.723 --> 00:50:47.963
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?

00:50:48.643 --> 00:50:52.483
Science, but I understand
your confusion.

00:50:52.923 --> 00:50:55.763
Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

00:50:56.003 --> 00:51:00.123
Hydra is assembling an arsenal to
destroy my enemies in one stroke,

00:51:00.283 --> 00:51:03.683
wherever they are, regardless
of how many forces they possess,

00:51:03.723 --> 00:51:04.883
all in a matter of hours.

00:51:05.163 --> 00:51:06.523
Your enemies?

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:09.243
My weapons contain
enough destructive power

00:51:09.323 --> 00:51:11.963
to decimate every
hostile capital on Earth.

00:51:14.443 --> 00:51:16.123
Quite simply, gentlemen,

00:51:17.043 --> 00:51:19.563
I have harnessed
the power of the gods.

00:51:21.563 --> 00:51:22.643
Thank you, Schmidt.

00:51:22.723 --> 00:51:23.723
For what?

00:51:24.163 --> 00:51:27.403
For making it clear how
obviously mad you are.

00:51:27.483 --> 00:51:28.923
Berlin is on this map!

00:51:29.843 --> 00:51:31.403
So it is.

00:51:33.443 --> 00:51:36.043
You will be punished
for your insolence!

00:51:36.083 --> 00:51:38.683
You will be brought
before the <i>Fuhrer</i> himself!

00:51:47.923 --> 00:51:49.923
Schmidt...

00:51:54.843 --> 00:51:56.803
My apologies, Doctor,

00:51:56.883 --> 00:52:01.923
but we both knew Hydra could
grow no further in Hitler's shadow.

00:52:03.243 --> 00:52:04.283
Hail Hydra.

00:52:05.083 --> 00:52:06.803
Hail Hydra!

00:52:11.363 --> 00:52:13.123
Hail Hydra!

00:52:19.699 --> 00:52:21.459
Hail Hydra!
