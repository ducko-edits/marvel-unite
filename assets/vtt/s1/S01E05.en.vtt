WEBVTT

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.651
Emission signature is unusual.

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:17.090
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.753
Though I doubt Rogers
picked up on that.

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:24.412
Seems harmless enough.

00:00:25.388 --> 00:00:27.553
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:38.319
Write that down.

00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:08.876
<i>270 at 30 knots.
Holding steady at 15,000 feet.</i>

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:12.040
<i>You are clear for exfiltration
over the drop zone.</i>

00:03:06.328 --> 00:03:08.504
It's good to be back.

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:11.876
- You missed me?
- Blow something up!

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.760
- I missed you, too.
- Blow something up?

00:03:13.843 --> 00:03:15.453
I already did that.

00:03:16.213 --> 00:03:17.674
I'm not saying…

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:19.663
that the world is enjoying its…

00:03:19.746 --> 00:03:23.544
longest period of uninterrupted
peace in years because of me.

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:28.709
I'm not saying…

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.881
that from the ashes of captivity…

00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:37.374
never has a greater phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:42.471
I'm not saying…

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:43.990
that Uncle Sam…

00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:46.577
can kick back on a lawn chair…

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.287
sipping on an iced tea…

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.415
because I haven't come across
anyone who's man enough…

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:54.388
to go toe-to-toe with me
on my best day.

00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:00.007
I love you, Tony!

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.189
Please, it's not about me.

00:04:03.594 --> 00:04:05.686
It's not about you.

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:08.937
It's not even about us.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.734
It's about legacy.

00:04:11.477 --> 00:04:14.488
It's about what we choose
to leave behind for future generations.

00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:16.841
And that's why for the next year…

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:18.805
and for the first time since 1974…

00:04:18.888 --> 00:04:21.195
the best and brightest men
and women…

00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:23.291
of nations and corporations
the world over…

00:04:23.374 --> 00:04:24.995
will pool their resources…

00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:26.826
share their collective vision…

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:28.421
to leave behind…

00:04:28.504 --> 00:04:29.891
a brighter future.

00:04:29.974 --> 00:04:31.743
It's not about us.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.835
Therefore, what I'm saying,
if I'm saying anything…

00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:37.047
is welcome back…

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.762
to the Stark Expo.

00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:42.970
And now…

00:04:43.053 --> 00:04:44.909
making a special guest appearance…

00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:47.388
from the great beyond
to tell you what it's all about…

00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.273
please welcome my father, Howard.

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:55.235
<i>Everything is achievable
through technology.</i>

00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:56.576
<i>Better living…</i>

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.041
<i>robust health…</i>

00:04:58.148 --> 00:05:00.215
<i>and for the first time in human history…</i>

00:05:00.298 --> 00:05:02.695
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

00:05:02.778 --> 00:05:04.697
<i>So, from all of us here
at Stark lndustries…</i>

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.347
<i>I would like to personally introduce you
to the City of the Future.</i>

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.414
<i>Technology holds infinite possibilities
for mankind…</i>

00:05:13.497 --> 00:05:16.334
<i>and will one day rid
society of all its ills.</i>

00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:20.004
<i>Soon, technology will affect the way
you live your life every day.</i>

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:21.881
<i>No more tedious work…</i>

00:05:21.964 --> 00:05:26.385
<i>leaving more time for leisure activities
and enjoying the sweet life.</i>

00:05:26.468 --> 00:05:28.147
<i>The Stark Expo.</i>

00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:29.760
<i>Welcome.</i>

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.313
<i>We are coming to you live
from the kickoff of the Stark Expo…</i>

00:05:37.396 --> 00:05:40.274
<i>where Tony Stark
has just walked offstage.</i>

00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:42.258
<i>Don't worry if you can't
make it down here tonight…</i>

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:44.421
<i>because this Expo goes on
all year long.</i>

00:05:44.504 --> 00:05:46.543
<i>And I'm gonna be here
checking out all the attractions…</i>

00:05:46.626 --> 00:05:50.236
<i>and the pavilions and the inventions
from all around the world.</i>

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:51.458
<i>- To make sure you join me…</i>
- Alright

00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:53.023
it's a zoo out there, watch out.

00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:55.623
Open up, let's go.
Hey! Nice to see you.

00:05:55.706 --> 00:05:56.699
Alright. Thank you.

00:05:56.782 --> 00:05:57.938
- I remember you.
- Tony, Tony…

00:05:58.021 --> 00:05:59.370
Hi. Hey, hey…

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.972
- Call me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:01.919
Come on, come on.

00:06:02.002 --> 00:06:03.096
Hello dear friend.

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:04.734
It would be a pleasure.

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:06.550
Ok.
See you, buddy.

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:07.718
This is Larry.

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.887
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.
What a pleasure.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.472
- Nice to see you.
- Call me. Call me.

00:06:11.555 --> 00:06:13.509
- Larry King.
- Larry!

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:16.250
Yes, my people, my people.

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:17.812
Come on, Tony. There we go.

00:06:17.895 --> 00:06:19.756
- Very mellow.
- That wasn't so bad.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.148
No, it was perfect.

00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:22.733
Look what we got here,
the new model.

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:24.851
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:25.695
Hi.
Hi.

00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:26.946
- And you are?
- Marshal.

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:28.948
- Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you, Tony.

00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:29.733
I'm on the wheel.

00:06:29.816 --> 00:06:31.242
Do you mind? Where you from?

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:32.706
- Bedford.
- What are you doing here?

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:34.959
- Looking for you.
- Yeah? You found me.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.663
What are you up to later?

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:39.390
Serving subpoenas.

00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:43.620
He doesn't like to be handed things.

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:45.256
- Yeah, I have a peeve.
- I got it.

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.465
You are hereby ordered…

00:06:46.548 --> 00:06:48.801
to appear before the Senate
Armed Services Committee…

00:06:48.884 --> 00:06:50.511
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

00:06:50.594 --> 00:06:52.353
- Can I see a badge?
- You wanna see the badge?

00:06:52.436 --> 00:06:53.516
He likes the badge.

00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:56.569
- You still like it?
- Yep.

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.202
How far are we from D.C.?

00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:02.531
D.C.? 250 miles.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.593
We should never have let him go.

00:07:17.676 --> 00:07:19.178
There was no stopping him.

00:07:19.261 --> 00:07:21.222
Well, at least
he's only banished, not dead.

00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:22.598
Which is what we'd all be…

00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:25.176
if that guard hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.

00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:33.576
How did the guard even know?

00:07:33.846 --> 00:07:35.007
I told him.

00:07:36.609 --> 00:07:37.687
What?

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.116
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:41.877
He should be flogged for taking so long.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.160
We should never have
reached Jotunheim.

00:07:43.243 --> 00:07:44.370
You told the guard?

00:07:44.453 --> 00:07:46.048
I saved our lives.

00:07:46.455 --> 00:07:48.053
And Thor's.

00:07:48.374 --> 00:07:51.143
I had no idea Father would banish him
for what he did.

00:07:52.044 --> 00:07:53.345
Loki.

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:56.632
You must go to the Allfather
and convince him to change his mind.

00:07:56.715 --> 00:07:58.562
And if I do, then what?

00:07:59.385 --> 00:08:02.722
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is.

00:08:02.805 --> 00:08:05.394
He's arrogant.
He's reckless. He's dangerous.

00:08:05.477 --> 00:08:07.254
You saw how he was today.

00:08:07.768 --> 00:08:09.759
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

00:08:13.972 --> 00:08:16.291
He may speak of the good of Asgard…

00:08:16.484 --> 00:08:18.901
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

00:08:19.738 --> 00:08:22.042
We should be grateful to him,
he saved our lives.

00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:23.622
Laufey said…

00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:26.962
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

00:08:27.413 --> 00:08:28.903
A master of magic…

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:31.590
could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.011
Loki's always been one for mischief…

00:08:35.094 --> 00:08:37.495
but you're talking
about something else entirely.

00:08:58.289 --> 00:08:59.535
Stop!

00:09:03.115 --> 00:09:04.867
Am I cursed?

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.245
No.

00:09:10.406 --> 00:09:11.878
What am I?

00:09:12.624 --> 00:09:14.267
You're my son.

00:09:24.136 --> 00:09:26.261
What more than that?

00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:34.931
The Casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?

00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:42.665
No.

00:09:44.573 --> 00:09:47.749
In the aftermath of the battle
I went into the temple…

00:09:47.926 --> 00:09:49.307
and I found a baby.

00:09:53.332 --> 00:09:56.476
Small for a giant's offspring.

00:09:56.752 --> 00:09:58.702
Abandoned, suffering…

00:09:58.841 --> 00:10:00.243
left to die.

00:10:00.672 --> 00:10:02.276
Laufey's son.

00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:05.698
Laufey's son.

00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:10.416
Yes.

00:10:14.182 --> 00:10:15.422
Why?

00:10:15.521 --> 00:10:17.619
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood…

00:10:17.702 --> 00:10:18.889
why would you take me?

00:10:18.972 --> 00:10:20.443
You were an innocent child.

00:10:20.526 --> 00:10:21.380
No.

00:10:21.463 --> 00:10:23.388
You took me for a purpose.

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:24.790
What was it?

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.361
Tell me!

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.084
I thought we could unite
our kingdoms one day.

00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:38.377
Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.855
Through you.

00:10:39.979 --> 00:10:41.140
What?

00:10:42.164 --> 00:10:44.258
But those plans no longer matter.

00:10:46.183 --> 00:10:49.299
So I am no more
than another stolen relic…

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.922
locked up, here until you might
have use of me.

00:10:52.005 --> 00:10:53.241
Why do you twist my words?

00:10:53.324 --> 00:10:55.355
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning…

00:10:55.438 --> 00:10:56.729
why didn't you?

00:10:56.812 --> 00:10:58.284
You're my son.

00:10:58.634 --> 00:11:01.146
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

00:11:01.236 --> 00:11:01.901
Why…

00:11:01.984 --> 00:11:03.736
because I'm the monster…

00:11:03.819 --> 00:11:06.206
parents tell their children about
at night?

00:11:06.289 --> 00:11:08.120
No, no.
You know, it all makes sense now!

00:11:08.203 --> 00:11:10.987
Why you favored Thor
all these years!

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.354
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me…

00:11:14.498 --> 00:11:17.921
you could never have a Frost Giant
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

00:11:37.603 --> 00:11:39.246
Guards!

00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:42.037
Guards, please, help!

00:11:58.609 --> 00:12:01.245
The fifth one was here in Poland,
right near the Baltic.

00:12:01.328 --> 00:12:03.865
And the sixth one was…

00:12:04.205 --> 00:12:06.363
about… here…

00:12:06.446 --> 00:12:09.402
30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line.

00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:12.323
I just got a quick look.

00:12:13.488 --> 00:12:15.307
Well, nobody's perfect.

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:20.929
These are the weapon factories
we know about.

00:12:21.711 --> 00:12:25.981
Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all
the parts to another facility that isn't on this map.

00:12:26.064 --> 00:12:27.920
Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6.

00:12:28.003 --> 00:12:30.695
I want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.

00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:31.676
What about us?

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:34.583
We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidt's ass.

00:12:34.666 --> 00:12:35.890
What do you say, Rogers?

00:12:36.316 --> 00:12:38.686
It's your map. You think
you can wipe Hydra off it?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.797
Yes, sir.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.856
I will need a team.

00:12:40.939 --> 00:12:43.115
We're already putting together
the best men.

00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:44.975
With all due respect sir…

00:12:45.153 --> 00:12:46.451
so am I.

00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:48.670
So, let's get this straight.

00:12:48.753 --> 00:12:51.354
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

00:12:52.776 --> 00:12:53.917
Pretty much.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.243
Sounds rather…

00:12:55.366 --> 00:12:56.821
fun actually.

00:12:58.151 --> 00:12:58.905
I am in.

00:12:58.988 --> 00:13:01.984
I will fight until the last of these
bastards are dead…

00:13:02.067 --> 00:13:04.199
chained or crying like a little baby.

00:13:04.282 --> 00:13:05.703
I hope the three.

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:07.334
Me too!

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.829
We're in.

00:13:13.832 --> 00:13:15.228
Hell, I will always fight.

00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:17.469
But you got to do one thing for me.

00:13:17.558 --> 00:13:18.813
What's that?

00:13:20.439 --> 00:13:21.763
Open a tab.

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:26.684
Well, that was easy.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:27.853
Another round.

00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:29.750
Where are they putting all this stuff?

00:13:33.592 --> 00:13:34.592
See?

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.148
I told you.

00:13:36.296 --> 00:13:38.056
They're all idiots.

00:13:38.978 --> 00:13:40.197
How about you?

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.347
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.614
Hell, no.

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:50.185
That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.

00:13:51.097 --> 00:13:52.834
I am following him.

00:13:56.682 --> 00:13:58.676
But you're keeping the outfit, right?

00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:02.010
You know what?

00:14:02.971 --> 00:14:04.394
It's kind of growing on me.

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:17.544
Captain.
Agent Carter.

00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:20.770
Ma'am.

00:14:20.853 --> 00:14:22.544
Howard has some equipment
for you to try…

00:14:22.627 --> 00:14:23.894
tomorrow morning?

00:14:23.977 --> 00:14:25.305
Sounds good.

00:14:29.803 --> 00:14:32.688
I see your top squad is prepping for duty.

00:14:33.309 --> 00:14:34.668
You don't like music?

00:14:34.751 --> 00:14:36.223
I do, actually.

00:14:37.606 --> 00:14:40.682
I might, even when
this is all over, go dancing.

00:14:40.765 --> 00:14:42.534
Then what are we waiting for?

00:14:43.651 --> 00:14:45.203
The right partner.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.047
0800, Captain.

00:14:48.488 --> 00:14:49.795
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:49.878 --> 00:14:51.116
I will be there.

00:14:51.449 --> 00:14:52.798
I am invisible.

00:14:53.297 --> 00:14:54.937
I am turning into you.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.587
It's like a horrible dream.

00:14:57.165 --> 00:14:58.578
Don't take it so hard.

00:14:58.686 --> 00:15:00.204
Maybe she's got a friend.

00:15:00.988 --> 00:15:04.292
Allfather,
we must speak with you urgently.

00:15:16.838 --> 00:15:19.090
My friends.

00:15:19.173 --> 00:15:20.791
Where's Odin?

00:15:21.092 --> 00:15:23.907
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.

00:15:25.513 --> 00:15:28.360
Mother fears
he may never awaken again.

00:15:28.691 --> 00:15:30.018
We would speak with her.

00:15:30.101 --> 00:15:33.338
She has refused to leave
my father's bedside.

00:15:35.711 --> 00:15:38.287
You can bring your urgent matter to me.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.343
Your king.

00:15:58.254 --> 00:15:59.501
My King…

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:02.901
we would ask that you end
Thor's banishment.

00:16:07.332 --> 00:16:11.155
My first command cannot be
to undo the Allfather's last.

00:16:13.436 --> 00:16:15.953
We're on the brink of war
with Jotunheim.

00:16:17.106 --> 00:16:19.954
Our people need
a sense of continuity…

00:16:20.067 --> 00:16:23.166
in order to feel safe
in these difficult times.

00:16:24.071 --> 00:16:26.209
All of us must stand together…

00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:28.672
for the good of Asgard.

00:16:30.828 --> 00:16:32.356
Yes, of course.

00:16:32.747 --> 00:16:34.769
Good. Then you will wait for my word.

00:16:35.142 --> 00:16:36.359
If I may…

00:16:37.376 --> 00:16:40.654
beg the indulgence of Your Majesty…

00:16:40.931 --> 00:16:41.965
to perhaps reconsider…

00:16:42.048 --> 00:16:43.256
We're done!

00:17:01.675 --> 00:17:03.472
Mr Stark, please.

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:05.850
Pick up now where we left off?

00:17:06.024 --> 00:17:07.557
Mr Stark. Please.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.295
Yes, dear?
Can I have your attention?

00:17:09.378 --> 00:17:10.217
Absolutely.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.479
Do you or do you not possess
a specialised weapon?

00:17:13.562 --> 00:17:15.255
I do not.
You do not?

00:17:15.338 --> 00:17:17.924
I do not. Well, it depends on how
you define the word weapon.

00:17:18.007 --> 00:17:19.251
The Iron Man weapon.

00:17:19.334 --> 00:17:21.195
My device does not fit that description.

00:17:21.278 --> 00:17:22.989
Well… How would you describe it?

00:17:23.072 --> 00:17:26.075
I would describe it by defining it
as what it is, Senator.

00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:28.056
As? It's a…

00:17:28.151 --> 00:17:29.911
It's a high-tech prosthesis.

00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:31.080
That is… That is…

00:17:31.163 --> 00:17:33.444
That's actually the most apt description
I can make of it.

00:17:33.527 --> 00:17:35.280
It's a weapon.
It's a weapon, Mr Stark.

00:17:35.363 --> 00:17:37.658
Please, if your priority was actually,
I hate to inform you it's a weapon.

00:17:37.741 --> 00:17:38.588
The well-being of the American citizen…

00:17:38.671 --> 00:17:41.467
My priority is to get the Iron Man
weapon turned over to the people…

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.871
- …of the United States of America.
- Well, you can forget it.

00:17:45.594 --> 00:17:47.057
I am Iron Man.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.311
The suit and I are one.

00:17:49.394 --> 00:17:51.854
To turn over the Iron Man suit
would be to turn over myself…

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:55.060
which is tantamount
to indentured servitude or prostitution…

00:17:55.143 --> 00:17:56.731
depending on what state you're in.

00:17:56.814 --> 00:17:57.653
You can't have it.

00:17:57.736 --> 00:17:59.776
Look, I'm no expert…

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:02.833
In prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator. Come on.

00:18:04.613 --> 00:18:06.835
I'm no expert in weapons.

00:18:07.056 --> 00:18:09.001
We have somebody here
who is an expert on weapons.

00:18:09.084 --> 00:18:11.142
I'd now like to call Justin Hammer…

00:18:11.225 --> 00:18:14.348
our current primary weapons contractor.

00:18:14.832 --> 00:18:18.460
Let the record reflect that I observed
Mr Hammer entering the chamber…

00:18:18.543 --> 00:18:19.754
and I am wondering…

00:18:19.837 --> 00:18:23.361
if and when any actual expert
will also be in attendance.

00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:29.074
Absolutely.

00:18:29.255 --> 00:18:31.891
I'm no expert.
I defer to you, Anthony.

00:18:31.974 --> 00:18:33.467
You're the wonder boy.

00:18:33.932 --> 00:18:35.781
Senator, if I may.

00:18:36.228 --> 00:18:38.060
I may well not be an expert…

00:18:38.143 --> 00:18:40.693
but you know who was the expert?

00:18:40.816 --> 00:18:42.064
Your dad.

00:18:42.147 --> 00:18:43.389
Howard Stark.

00:18:43.472 --> 00:18:45.211
Really a father to us all…

00:18:45.294 --> 00:18:48.315
and to the military-industrial age.

00:18:48.532 --> 00:18:51.014
Let's just be clear.
He was no flower child.

00:18:51.097 --> 00:18:52.649
He was a lion.

00:18:53.083 --> 00:18:55.581
We all know why we're here.
In the last six months…

00:18:55.664 --> 00:18:59.645
Anthony Stark has created a sword
with untold possibilities.

00:18:59.728 --> 00:19:01.187
And yet he insists…

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.672
it's a shield.

00:19:02.755 --> 00:19:05.189
He asks us to trust him…

00:19:05.272 --> 00:19:07.310
as we cower behind it.

00:19:07.462 --> 00:19:10.758
I wish I were comforted, Anthony,
I really do.

00:19:10.846 --> 00:19:13.766
I'd love to leave my door unlocked
when I leave the house…

00:19:14.058 --> 00:19:15.476
but this ain't Canada.

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:17.278
You know, we live in a world
of grave threats…

00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:18.539
threats that Mr Stark…

00:19:18.622 --> 00:19:21.373
will not always be able to foresee.

00:19:22.144 --> 00:19:23.449
Thank you.

00:19:23.637 --> 00:19:25.919
God bless Iron Man.
God bless America.

00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:29.657
That is well said, Mr Hammer.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.659
The committee would now like to invite

00:19:31.742 --> 00:19:34.871
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
to the chamber.

00:19:34.954 --> 00:19:36.835
Rhodey? What?

00:19:42.795 --> 00:19:44.108
Hey, buddy.

00:19:44.733 --> 00:19:46.048
I didn't expect to see you here.

00:19:46.131 --> 00:19:49.058
Look, it's me, I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

00:19:49.292 --> 00:19:50.414
I just… Drop it.

00:19:50.497 --> 00:19:51.470
Alright, I'll drop it.

00:19:51.553 --> 00:19:55.140
I have before me a complete report
on the Iron Man weapon…

00:19:55.223 --> 00:19:57.810
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
And, Colonel for the record…

00:19:57.893 --> 00:20:01.022
can you please read page 57,
paragraph four?

00:20:01.105 --> 00:20:03.357
You're requesting
that I read specific selections…

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.842
- …from my report, Senator?
- Yes, sir.

00:20:04.925 --> 00:20:06.888
It was my understanding
that I was going to be testifying…

00:20:06.971 --> 00:20:09.069
in a much more comprehensive
and detailed manner.

00:20:09.152 --> 00:20:10.698
I understand.
A lot of things have changed today.

00:20:10.781 --> 00:20:11.992
So if you could just read…
You do understand that reading…

00:20:12.075 --> 00:20:14.577
a single paragraph
out of context does not reflect…

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.434
- the summary of my final--
- Just read it, Colonel. I do.

00:20:16.517 --> 00:20:17.788
Thank you.

00:20:18.943 --> 00:20:20.093
Very well.

00:20:22.123 --> 00:20:25.717
As he does not operate within
any definable branch of government…

00:20:27.576 --> 00:20:31.719
Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation…

00:20:31.802 --> 00:20:33.221
and to her interests.

00:20:33.304 --> 00:20:35.223
I did, however, go on to summarise…

00:20:35.306 --> 00:20:38.191
that the benefits of Iron Man
far outweigh the liabilities.

00:20:38.274 --> 00:20:40.228
- And that it would be in our interest…
- That's enough, Colonel.

00:20:40.311 --> 00:20:41.550
- …to fold Mr Stark…
- That's enough.

00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:43.340
…into the existing
chain of command, Senator.

00:20:43.423 --> 00:20:46.543
I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider
Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.553
We can amend the hours a little bit.

00:20:50.069 --> 00:20:51.961
I'd like to go on and show, if I may…

00:20:52.044 --> 00:20:54.033
the imagery that's connected
to your report.

00:20:54.116 --> 00:20:55.668
I believe it is somewhat premature…

00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:57.255
to reveal these images…

00:20:57.338 --> 00:20:58.860
- to the general public at this time.
- With all due respect…

00:20:58.943 --> 00:21:00.106
Colonel, I understand.

00:21:00.189 --> 00:21:01.885
And if you could
just narrate those for us…

00:21:01.968 --> 00:21:04.129
we'd be very grateful.

00:21:04.376 --> 00:21:05.901
Let's have the images.

00:21:07.796 --> 00:21:11.050
Intelligence suggests that
the devices seen in these photos…

00:21:11.133 --> 00:21:14.016
are in fact, attempts
at making manned copies…

00:21:14.099 --> 00:21:15.554
of Mr Stark's suit.

00:21:15.637 --> 00:21:18.753
This has been corroborated by our allies…

00:21:18.836 --> 00:21:19.959
and local intelligence…

00:21:20.042 --> 00:21:22.328
on the ground
indicating that these suits…

00:21:22.411 --> 00:21:24.759
are quite possibly at this moment…

00:21:24.842 --> 00:21:26.190
operational.

00:21:26.273 --> 00:21:28.228
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see…

00:21:29.011 --> 00:21:30.444
something here.

00:21:30.527 --> 00:21:31.726
Boy, I'm good.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.322
I commandeered your screens.

00:21:34.104 --> 00:21:35.214
I need them.

00:21:35.642 --> 00:21:37.201
Time for a little transparency.

00:21:37.284 --> 00:21:39.025
- Now, let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?

00:21:39.108 --> 00:21:41.972
If you will direct your attention
to said screens…

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:44.269
I believe that's North Korea.

00:21:53.283 --> 00:21:55.136
Can you turn that off?
Take it off.

00:21:55.219 --> 00:21:56.686
Iran.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.965
No grave immediate…

00:22:02.146 --> 00:22:04.194
threat here. Is that Justin Hammer?

00:22:04.561 --> 00:22:06.282
How did Hammer get in the game?

00:22:07.231 --> 00:22:09.448
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:11.304
<i>Ok, give me a left twist.</i>

00:22:11.387 --> 00:22:13.256
<i>Left's good. Turn to the right.</i>

00:22:16.115 --> 00:22:19.166
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

00:22:21.078 --> 00:22:22.220
Yeah I'd say…

00:22:22.303 --> 00:22:24.586
most countries, five, 10 years away.

00:22:24.957 --> 00:22:26.250
Hammer Industries, 20.

00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:29.003
I'd like to point out that
that test pilot survived.

00:22:29.086 --> 00:22:30.813
I think we're done,
is the point that he's making.

00:22:30.896 --> 00:22:33.880
- I don't think there is any reason--
- The point is, you're welcome…

00:22:33.963 --> 00:22:34.627
- I guess.
- For what?

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.755
Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.

00:22:36.927 --> 00:22:37.741
It's working.

00:22:37.824 --> 00:22:39.475
We're safe. America is secure.

00:22:39.558 --> 00:22:41.432
You want my property?
You can't have it.

00:22:41.515 --> 00:22:43.232
But I did you a big favour.

00:22:43.684 --> 00:22:46.405
I've successfully privatized world peace.

00:22:49.439 --> 00:22:50.857
What more do you want?

00:22:51.074 --> 00:22:52.435
For now!

00:22:53.026 --> 00:22:55.953
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

00:22:56.282 --> 00:22:57.777
[bleep] you, Mr Stark…

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.265
[bleep] you, buddy.

00:22:59.366 --> 00:23:01.368
We're adjourned.
We're adjourned for today.

00:23:01.451 --> 00:23:03.791
Ok.
You've been a delight.

00:23:11.178 --> 00:23:14.144
I never get used to seeing him like this.

00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:16.797
He's put it off for so long now…

00:23:17.076 --> 00:23:18.603
that I fear...

00:23:21.146 --> 00:23:22.820
How long will it last?

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.136
I don't know.

00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:26.171
This time it's different.

00:23:26.254 --> 00:23:27.925
We were unprepared.

00:23:29.696 --> 00:23:31.394
So why did he lie?

00:23:32.199 --> 00:23:36.162
He kept the truth from you
so that you would never feel different.

00:23:36.536 --> 00:23:39.010
You are our son, Loki…

00:23:39.373 --> 00:23:41.472
and we, your family.

00:23:43.377 --> 00:23:47.351
We mustn't lose hope
that your father will return to us.

00:23:48.548 --> 00:23:50.350
And your brother.

00:23:51.468 --> 00:23:53.470
What hope is there for Thor?

00:23:53.553 --> 00:23:57.448
There's always a purpose
to everything your father does.

00:24:01.079 --> 00:24:03.081
He committed a crime. He's in jail!

00:24:03.164 --> 00:24:05.500
- I can't just leave him there!
- Why?

00:24:05.583 --> 00:24:07.836
You didn't see what I saw!

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:09.969
Look!
Look, it's Myeu-muh.

00:24:14.676 --> 00:24:15.969
Where'd you find this?

00:24:16.052 --> 00:24:17.178
The children's section.

00:24:17.261 --> 00:24:19.480
I just wanted to show you
how silly his story was.

00:24:19.563 --> 00:24:21.550
But you're the one
who's always pushing me to…

00:24:21.633 --> 00:24:23.997
chase down every possibility,
every alternative!

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.148
I'm talking about science, not magic!

00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:28.588
Well, magic's just science
that we don't understand yet.

00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:31.151
- Arthur C. Clarke.
- Who wrote science fiction.

00:24:31.234 --> 00:24:33.990
- A precursor to science fact!
- In some cases, yeah.

00:24:34.073 --> 00:24:35.725
Well, if there is
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge…

00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:37.073
then there is something
on the other side.

00:24:37.156 --> 00:24:39.203
And advanced beings
could have crossed it!

00:24:39.286 --> 00:24:40.047
Jane.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.121
A primitive culture like the Vikings
might have worshipped them as deities.

00:24:43.204 --> 00:24:45.460
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

00:24:52.784 --> 00:24:54.778
You made my men,
some of the most…

00:24:54.861 --> 00:24:57.462
highly trained professionals in
the world look like a bunch of…

00:24:57.624 --> 00:24:59.473
minimum-wage mall cops.

00:25:01.139 --> 00:25:02.484
That's hurtful.

00:25:03.433 --> 00:25:04.663
In my experience…

00:25:04.746 --> 00:25:07.074
it takes someone
who's received similar training…

00:25:07.478 --> 00:25:08.953
to do what you did to them.

00:25:10.064 --> 00:25:12.622
Why don't you tell me
where you received your training?

00:25:12.942 --> 00:25:14.047
Pakistan?

00:25:14.143 --> 00:25:15.295
Chechnya?

00:25:15.378 --> 00:25:16.685
Afghanistan?

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.678
No, you strike me
more as the soldier of fortune type.

00:25:21.868 --> 00:25:23.030
Where was it?

00:25:23.309 --> 00:25:24.649
South Africa?

00:25:26.205 --> 00:25:30.081
Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.

00:25:32.462 --> 00:25:33.852
Who are you?

00:25:38.801 --> 00:25:41.554
One way or another,
we find out what we need to know.

00:25:41.637 --> 00:25:43.022
We're good at that.

00:25:48.686 --> 00:25:50.329
Don't go anywhere.

00:25:56.407 --> 00:25:57.588
Loki!

00:25:57.829 --> 00:25:59.211
What are you doing here?

00:25:59.322 --> 00:26:00.908
I had to see you.

00:26:02.492 --> 00:26:03.920
What's happened?

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.247
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

00:26:06.535 --> 00:26:07.914
Let me explain to Father.

00:26:07.997 --> 00:26:09.487
Father is dead.

00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:16.780
What?

00:26:18.674 --> 00:26:20.251
Your banishment…

00:26:21.344 --> 00:26:23.464
the threat of a new war…

00:26:24.597 --> 00:26:26.649
it was too much for him to bear.

00:26:29.018 --> 00:26:30.977
You mustn't blame yourself.

00:26:32.021 --> 00:26:33.985
I know that you loved him.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.108
I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.

00:26:39.473 --> 00:26:41.698
It was so cruel to put
the hammer within your reach…

00:26:41.781 --> 00:26:43.942
knowing that you could never lift it.

00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:49.834
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.661
Can I come home?

00:26:58.506 --> 00:27:01.760
The truce with Jotunheim
is conditional upon your exile.

00:27:01.843 --> 00:27:03.598
Yes, but couldn't we find a way.

00:27:03.681 --> 00:27:04.814
And Mother…

00:27:05.432 --> 00:27:08.173
has forbidden your return.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.810
This is goodbye, Brother.

00:27:15.559 --> 00:27:17.139
I'm so sorry.

00:27:22.864 --> 00:27:24.054
No.

00:27:25.533 --> 00:27:27.109
I am sorry.

00:27:32.623 --> 00:27:34.674
Thank you for coming here.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.767
Farewell.

00:27:53.811 --> 00:27:55.110
Goodbye.

00:27:56.063 --> 00:27:57.364
Goodbye?

00:27:57.648 --> 00:27:59.122
I just got back.

00:28:34.602 --> 00:28:35.404
Excuse me.

00:28:35.487 --> 00:28:37.129
I am looking for Mr. Stark.

00:28:37.212 --> 00:28:38.994
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

00:28:44.691 --> 00:28:47.010
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

00:28:51.766 --> 00:28:53.049
I…

00:28:54.242 --> 00:28:55.899
read about what you did.

00:28:56.612 --> 00:28:57.828
Tthe... Yeah.

00:28:58.697 --> 00:29:00.161
Well, that's you know.

00:29:01.807 --> 00:29:03.159
Just doing what needed to be done.

00:29:03.242 --> 00:29:06.575
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:14.686
Really, it's not a big deal.

00:29:15.513 --> 00:29:17.664
Tell that to their wives.

00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:22.510
I don't think they were all married.

00:29:22.593 --> 00:29:23.934
You're a hero.

00:29:24.422 --> 00:29:25.480
Well, that, no.

00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:27.023
That depends on the definition, really.

00:29:27.106 --> 00:29:28.563
The women of America…

00:29:28.646 --> 00:29:30.302
they owe you their thanks.

00:29:31.635 --> 00:29:34.572
And seeing as they're not here...

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.268
Captain.

00:29:44.391 --> 00:29:47.142
We're ready for you,
if you're not otherwise occupied.

00:29:48.273 --> 00:29:49.647
Agent Carter, wait.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:51.987
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.603
Peggy, that's not
what you thought it was.

00:29:53.686 --> 00:29:56.453
I don't think anything, Captain,
not one thing.

00:29:56.829 --> 00:29:58.725
You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are…

00:29:58.808 --> 00:30:00.392
just like all the rest.

00:30:00.718 --> 00:30:01.694
Well, what about you and Stark?

00:30:01.777 --> 00:30:03.581
How do I know you two haven't been…

00:30:03.664 --> 00:30:04.951
fondue-ing?

00:30:09.288 --> 00:30:11.952
You still don't know
a bloody thing about women.

00:30:13.221 --> 00:30:15.093
Fondue is just cheese and bread,
my friend.

00:30:15.176 --> 00:30:16.083
Really?

00:30:16.166 --> 00:30:17.941
I didn't think...
Nor should you, pal.

00:30:18.024 --> 00:30:20.204
The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head…

00:30:20.287 --> 00:30:22.656
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

00:30:22.739 --> 00:30:25.374
Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment…

00:30:25.457 --> 00:30:28.357
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.

00:30:28.563 --> 00:30:30.155
Carbon polymer.

00:30:30.865 --> 00:30:33.361
Should withstand your average
German bayonet.

00:30:33.448 --> 00:30:36.745
Although Hydra's not going
to attack you with a pocket knife.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.526
I hear you're…

00:30:38.682 --> 00:30:40.104
kind of attached.

00:30:40.187 --> 00:30:41.435
It's handier than you might think.

00:30:41.518 --> 00:30:43.938
I took the liberty of coming up
with some options.

00:30:44.707 --> 00:30:46.031
This one's fun.

00:30:46.262 --> 00:30:48.309
She's been fitted with
electrical relays…

00:30:48.392 --> 00:30:49.508
that allow you to...
What about this one?

00:30:49.591 --> 00:30:50.480
No, no, that's just a prototype.

00:30:50.563 --> 00:30:51.766
What's it made of?

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.244
Vibranium.

00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:56.180
It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

00:30:57.181 --> 00:30:59.953
It's completely vibration absorbent.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.310
How come it's not standard issue?

00:31:03.393 --> 00:31:04.796
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

00:31:04.879 --> 00:31:06.709
What you're holding there,
that's all we have got.

00:31:06.792 --> 00:31:08.502
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

00:31:09.042 --> 00:31:11.104
I am sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.

00:31:11.187 --> 00:31:12.343
What do you think?

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:24.603
Yes, I think it works.

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:35.795
I had some ideas about the uniform.

00:31:36.383 --> 00:31:38.017
Whatever you want, pal.

00:31:44.788 --> 00:31:46.289
Wake up. Daddy's home.

00:31:46.372 --> 00:31:47.958
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:49.960
<i>Congratulations on
the opening ceremonies.</i>

00:31:50.043 --> 00:31:52.854
<i>They were such a success,
as was your Senate hearing.</i>

00:31:53.129 --> 00:31:54.976
<i>And may I say how refreshing it is…</i>

00:31:55.059 --> 00:31:57.817
<i>to finally see you in a video
with your clothing on, sir.</i>

00:32:00.637 --> 00:32:01.779
You!

00:32:02.456 --> 00:32:04.692
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.

00:32:04.775 --> 00:32:06.521
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

00:32:07.769 --> 00:32:11.148
How many ounces a day of this
gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?

00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:15.035
<i>We are up to 80 ounces a day
to counteract the symptoms, sir.</i>

00:32:16.152 --> 00:32:17.891
Check palladium levels.

00:32:20.073 --> 00:32:22.707
<i>Blood toxicity, 24%.</i>

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.246
<i>It appears that the continued use
of the Iron Man suit…</i>

00:32:26.329 --> 00:32:28.466
<i>is accelerating your condition.</i>

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.413
<i>Another core has been depleted.</i>

00:32:36.089 --> 00:32:37.674
God, they're running out quick.

00:32:37.757 --> 00:32:40.427
<i>I have run simulations
on every known element…</i>

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.494
<i>and none can serve
as a viable replacement…</i>

00:32:42.577 --> 00:32:44.272
<i>for the palladium core.</i>

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:49.393
<i>You are running out of both time
and options.</i>

00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:56.359
<i>Unfortunately, the device
that's keeping you alive…</i>

00:32:56.442 --> 00:32:57.996
<i>is also killing you.</i>

00:32:59.779 --> 00:33:01.143
<i>Miss Potts is approaching.</i>

00:33:01.226 --> 00:33:03.470
<i>- I recommend that you inform her…</i>
- Mute.

00:33:07.287 --> 00:33:08.660
Is this a joke?

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:11.958
- What are you thinking?
- What?

00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:14.377
- What are you thinking?
- Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.631
And you're angry about something.

00:33:16.838 --> 00:33:18.237
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:18.980
Did you just…

00:33:19.063 --> 00:33:20.962
- …donate our entire…
- Keep your business.

00:33:21.045 --> 00:33:23.386
…modern art collection to, to the…

00:33:23.469 --> 00:33:25.223
- …Boy Scouts of America?
- Boy Scouts of America.

00:33:25.306 --> 00:33:26.932
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.

00:33:27.015 --> 00:33:29.093
I didn't physically check the crates but…

00:33:29.176 --> 00:33:30.442
basically, yes.

00:33:30.525 --> 00:33:32.688
And it's not our collection,
it's my collection. No offence.

00:33:32.771 --> 00:33:35.564
No, you know what?
I think I'm actually entitled to say…

00:33:35.647 --> 00:33:37.213
our collection considering…

00:33:37.296 --> 00:33:39.764
the time that I put in over 10 years…

00:33:39.847 --> 00:33:40.614
- …curating that.
- Really?

00:33:40.697 --> 00:33:41.671
- It was a tax write-off, I needed that.
- Yes.

00:33:41.754 --> 00:33:44.825
You know, there is only about
8,011 things…

00:33:44.908 --> 00:33:46.817
that I really need to talk to you about.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.411
Dummy.
Hey, stop spacing out.

00:33:48.494 --> 00:33:50.043
The Bridgeport's
already machining that part.

00:33:50.126 --> 00:33:52.415
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

00:33:52.498 --> 00:33:54.731
I need you to wear a surgical mask
until you're feeling better.

00:33:54.814 --> 00:33:55.919
- Is that ok?
- That's rude.

00:33:56.002 --> 00:33:57.652
There's nothing more important to me
than the Expo.

00:33:57.735 --> 00:33:58.922
It's my primary point of concern.

00:33:59.005 --> 00:34:02.432
- I don't know why you're--
- The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

00:34:02.815 --> 00:34:03.815
Look at that.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.449
That's modern art.

00:34:06.941 --> 00:34:07.597
That's going up.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.238
- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

00:34:10.516 --> 00:34:13.020
- Stark is in complete disarray.
- This is vital.

00:34:13.103 --> 00:34:13.985
- You understand that?
- No!

00:34:14.068 --> 00:34:15.197
Our stocks have never been higher.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.148
- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
- Well you are missing part of--

00:34:17.231 --> 00:34:18.671
- Let me give you an example.
- If it's messy then let's double back.

00:34:18.754 --> 00:34:19.676
Let's move on to another…

00:34:19.759 --> 00:34:20.819
- No, no, no, no.
- …subject.

00:34:20.902 --> 00:34:22.682
You are not taking down
the Barnett Newman…

00:34:22.765 --> 00:34:24.115
- …and hanging that up!
- I'm not taking it down.

00:34:24.198 --> 00:34:25.554
I'm just replacing it with this.

00:34:25.637 --> 00:34:27.006
- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Ok, fine.

00:34:27.089 --> 00:34:28.351
My point is…

00:34:28.434 --> 00:34:30.442
- …we have already awarded contracts…
- Yeah.

00:34:30.525 --> 00:34:31.955
- …to the wind farm people…
- Don't say wind farm.

00:34:32.038 --> 00:34:34.041
- …and to the plastic plantation tree…
- I'm already feeling gassy.

00:34:34.124 --> 00:34:35.592
- …which was your idea by the way.
- Yes.

00:34:35.675 --> 00:34:36.793
- Those people are on payroll…
- Right.

00:34:36.876 --> 00:34:38.468
- …and you won't make a decision.
- Everything was my idea. I don't care…

00:34:38.551 --> 00:34:40.075
- I can't!
- …about the liberal agenda any more.

00:34:40.158 --> 00:34:42.465
It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.

00:34:42.548 --> 00:34:43.724
You do it.

00:34:44.256 --> 00:34:45.424
- I do what?
- Excellent idea.

00:34:45.507 --> 00:34:47.451
I just figured this out.
You run the company.

00:34:47.708 --> 00:34:49.964
- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

00:34:50.047 --> 00:34:51.110
Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
You will not…

00:34:51.193 --> 00:34:52.781
- I'm not asking you to try to do it.
- …give me the information I need…

00:34:52.864 --> 00:34:53.969
- I'm asking you to physically do it.
- …in order to--

00:34:54.052 --> 00:34:54.947
I need you to do it.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.700
- I am trying to do it.
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!

00:34:56.783 --> 00:34:58.626
- No, you are not listening to me.
- I'm trying to make you CEO!

00:34:59.247 --> 00:35:00.701
Why won't you let me?

00:35:01.859 --> 00:35:03.333
Have you been drinking?

00:35:03.905 --> 00:35:05.340
Chlorophyll.

00:35:06.781 --> 00:35:07.857
I hereby…

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.019
irrevocably appoint you chairman
and CEO of Stark Industries…

00:35:11.102 --> 00:35:12.635
effective immediately.

00:35:15.206 --> 00:35:16.498
Yeah, done deal.

00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:17.581
Ok?

00:35:18.584 --> 00:35:21.125
I've actually given this
a fair amount of thought…

00:35:21.254 --> 00:35:22.262
believe it or not.

00:35:22.345 --> 00:35:24.582
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak…

00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:28.571
trying to figure out
who a worthy successor would be.

00:35:29.141 --> 00:35:30.674
And then I realised…

00:35:33.441 --> 00:35:34.657
it's you.

00:35:35.269 --> 00:35:36.609
It's always been you.

00:35:38.104 --> 00:35:39.491
I thought there'd be a legal issue but…

00:35:39.574 --> 00:35:42.933
actually I'm capable
of appointing my successor.

00:35:43.484 --> 00:35:45.267
My successor being you.

00:35:47.655 --> 00:35:48.990
Congratulations?

00:35:51.075 --> 00:35:52.731
- Take it, just take it.
- I don't know what to think.

00:35:52.814 --> 00:35:54.060
Don't think. Drink.

00:36:03.249 --> 00:36:04.438
Sir?

00:36:05.409 --> 00:36:06.911
He's got a visitor.

00:36:12.007 --> 00:36:13.843
His name is Donald Blake?

00:36:13.926 --> 00:36:15.673
Dr. Donald Blake.

00:36:15.756 --> 00:36:17.916
You have dangerous coworkers,
Dr. Selvig.

00:36:17.999 --> 00:36:21.605
He was distraught when he found out
that you've taken all our research.

00:36:22.268 --> 00:36:25.210
That was years of his life, gone!

00:36:26.946 --> 00:36:29.485
You can understand
how a man could go off like that.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.569
A big, faceless organization like yours…

00:36:31.652 --> 00:36:34.129
coming in with their
jackbooted thugs and...

00:36:35.781 --> 00:36:37.283
That's how he put it.

00:36:37.366 --> 00:36:38.332
That still doesn't explain…

00:36:38.415 --> 00:36:40.472
how he managed
to tear through our security.

00:36:40.761 --> 00:36:42.152
Steroids!

00:36:42.338 --> 00:36:44.387
He's a bit of a fitness nut.

00:36:45.457 --> 00:36:46.582
Sir?

00:36:51.608 --> 00:36:52.798
It says here that he's an M.D.

00:36:52.881 --> 00:36:55.136
Well, he is! Or he was.

00:36:55.219 --> 00:36:58.005
He switched careers
and became a physicist.

00:36:58.088 --> 00:36:59.555
A brilliant physicist.

00:36:59.638 --> 00:37:02.683
He's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.417
Oh, Donny, Donny, Donny!

00:37:08.005 --> 00:37:09.425
There you are.

00:37:09.508 --> 00:37:12.240
You're gonna be alright.
I'm taking you home now.

00:37:26.332 --> 00:37:27.848
Dr. Selvig!

00:37:28.955 --> 00:37:31.292
Just keep him away from the bars.

00:37:31.907 --> 00:37:33.209
I will!

00:37:35.007 --> 00:37:36.446
Where are we going?

00:37:36.542 --> 00:37:38.129
To get a drink.

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:39.631
Follow them.

00:37:45.934 --> 00:37:48.057
You know, I had it all backwards.

00:37:50.189 --> 00:37:51.787
I had it all wrong.

00:37:55.345 --> 00:37:58.791
It's not a bad thing finding out
that you don't have all the answers.

00:37:59.379 --> 00:38:01.431
You start asking the right questions.

00:38:05.528 --> 00:38:07.298
For the first time in…

00:38:08.388 --> 00:38:10.448
my life I have…

00:38:11.404 --> 00:38:14.091
no idea what I'm supposed to do.

00:38:15.156 --> 00:38:17.964
Anyone who's ever going
to find his way in this world…

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.250
has to start by admitting
he doesn't know where the hell he is.

00:38:23.302 --> 00:38:24.724
Thank you for what you've done.

00:38:24.807 --> 00:38:26.194
No, don't thank me.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.936
I only did it for Jane.

00:38:28.979 --> 00:38:31.435
Her father and I
taught at university together.

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.398
He was a good man.

00:38:34.448 --> 00:38:35.840
He never listened.

00:38:36.805 --> 00:38:38.273
Neither did I.

00:38:39.571 --> 00:38:41.657
My father was trying
to teach me something…

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.963
but I was too stupid to see it.

00:38:44.743 --> 00:38:47.190
I don't know if you're delusional or…

00:38:47.401 --> 00:38:48.742
if you're pulling some kind of con…

00:38:48.825 --> 00:38:50.117
I don't care.

00:38:50.618 --> 00:38:52.261
I just care about her.

00:38:53.301 --> 00:38:55.395
I've seen the way she looks at you.

00:38:58.944 --> 00:39:01.510
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

00:39:01.593 --> 00:39:02.676
Good.

00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:05.303
In that case, I'll buy you another round…

00:39:05.773 --> 00:39:07.592
and you leave town tonight.

00:39:12.593 --> 00:39:14.272
Two boilermakers.

00:40:05.866 --> 00:40:07.606
Kill him.

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:11.400
After all I've done for you?

00:40:13.415 --> 00:40:18.295
So you're the one
who showed us the way into Asgard.

00:40:18.378 --> 00:40:20.615
That was just a bit of fun, really.

00:40:21.715 --> 00:40:24.897
To ruin my brother's big day.

00:40:25.552 --> 00:40:29.698
And to protect the realm
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

00:40:30.682 --> 00:40:33.124
I will hear you.

00:40:36.438 --> 00:40:38.252
I will conceal you…

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.210
and a handful of your soldiers…

00:40:41.568 --> 00:40:46.874
lead you into Odin's chambers,
and you can slay him where he lies.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.008
Why not kill him yourself?

00:40:50.786 --> 00:40:53.518
I suspect that the Asgardians
would not take kindly…

00:40:53.601 --> 00:40:56.371
to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.

00:40:57.107 --> 00:41:00.502
Once Odin is dead,
I will return the Casket to you…

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:05.107
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

00:41:08.011 --> 00:41:09.221
Glory.

00:41:10.789 --> 00:41:12.263
I…

00:41:13.475 --> 00:41:15.618
accept.

00:41:21.149 --> 00:41:22.800
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

00:41:22.883 --> 00:41:28.189
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

00:41:28.711 --> 00:41:29.882
You were shrouded from me…

00:41:29.965 --> 00:41:32.411
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

00:41:32.494 --> 00:41:36.139
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

00:41:36.264 --> 00:41:37.583
Or perhaps someone has found a way…

00:41:37.666 --> 00:41:40.868
to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.

00:41:42.004 --> 00:41:44.559
You have great power, Heimdall.

00:41:46.716 --> 00:41:48.609
Did Odin ever fear you?

00:41:50.345 --> 00:41:52.315
No.
And why is that?

00:41:52.398 --> 00:41:54.122
Because he is my king…

00:41:54.205 --> 00:41:55.601
and I am sworn to obey him.

00:41:55.684 --> 00:41:57.309
He was your king…

00:41:57.676 --> 00:41:59.960
and you're sworn to obey me now.

00:42:00.915 --> 00:42:02.149
Yes?

00:42:07.279 --> 00:42:08.427
Yes.

00:42:09.323 --> 00:42:11.669
Then you will open
the Bifrost to no one…

00:42:12.313 --> 00:42:15.261
until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.745
Oh, my God.

00:42:30.828 --> 00:42:32.002
Is he ok?

00:42:32.085 --> 00:42:34.281
He's fine. Not injured at all.

00:42:35.222 --> 00:42:36.517
I'm sorry, my friend.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.330
What happened?
We drank, we fought…

00:42:38.413 --> 00:42:40.418
he made his ancestors proud.

00:42:40.608 --> 00:42:42.134
Put him on the bed.

00:42:53.711 --> 00:42:57.248
I still don't think
you're the God of Thunder.

00:42:57.855 --> 00:43:00.048
But you ought to be.

00:43:11.196 --> 00:43:13.110
Are these your chambers?

00:43:13.632 --> 00:43:16.658
It's more of a temporary living situation.

00:43:17.252 --> 00:43:21.684
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

00:43:21.937 --> 00:43:23.079
Actually…

00:43:23.616 --> 00:43:25.184
I never have guests.

00:43:26.942 --> 00:43:29.325
That's not the right place for it.

00:43:30.246 --> 00:43:31.921
I'm sorry.

00:43:34.935 --> 00:43:36.282
Can we go outside?

00:43:37.003 --> 00:43:38.725
Yes, of course.

00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:46.563
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep or…

00:43:46.656 --> 00:43:50.619
I'm trying to reconcile particle data,
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

00:43:51.366 --> 00:43:55.011
I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

00:43:58.707 --> 00:44:00.653
I'm really glad you're safe.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.395
You've been very kind to me…

00:44:04.921 --> 00:44:07.216
and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.

00:44:07.299 --> 00:44:08.936
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times…

00:44:09.019 --> 00:44:11.367
so I think that kind of evens things out.

00:44:13.555 --> 00:44:15.562
Perhaps I had it coming.

00:44:21.229 --> 00:44:22.650
Oh, my God!

00:44:23.815 --> 00:44:25.317
I don't believe it!

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.100
It was all I could get back.

00:44:27.183 --> 00:44:28.750
I'm sorry it's not as much as
I promised.

00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:31.530
No, no, this is great! This is…

00:44:31.613 --> 00:44:33.731
I don't have to start from scratch now.

00:44:34.057 --> 00:44:35.279
Thank you.

00:44:40.174 --> 00:44:41.637
What's wrong?

00:44:42.832 --> 00:44:45.051
S.H.l.E.L.D.
Whatever they are…

00:44:46.672 --> 00:44:48.299
they're gonna do
everything in their power…

00:44:48.382 --> 00:44:51.124
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

00:44:51.259 --> 00:44:52.561
No, Jane.

00:44:53.178 --> 00:44:55.401
Listen to me. You must not give up.

00:44:55.583 --> 00:44:57.131
You must finish what you've started.

00:44:57.214 --> 00:44:59.068
Why?
Because you're right.

00:44:59.762 --> 00:45:00.778
Here, look.

00:45:03.786 --> 00:45:05.854
Your ancestors called it magic…

00:45:05.937 --> 00:45:07.537
and you call it science.

00:45:07.693 --> 00:45:10.746
Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

00:45:25.043 --> 00:45:26.585
What is that?

00:45:27.629 --> 00:45:29.118
My father…

00:45:29.552 --> 00:45:32.542
explained it to me like this,
that your world…

00:45:32.692 --> 00:45:35.512
is one of the Nine Realms
of the Cosmos…

00:45:35.595 --> 00:45:38.851
linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil…

00:45:38.934 --> 00:45:40.529
the Worlds Tree.

00:45:41.143 --> 00:45:44.117
Now you see it every day
without realizing.

00:45:44.439 --> 00:45:47.244
The images glimpsed through.
What did you call it?

00:45:47.883 --> 00:45:49.935
This Hooble Telescope.

00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:51.040
Hubble.

00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:52.826
Hubble Telescope.

00:45:55.907 --> 00:45:57.340
Tell me more.

00:45:57.826 --> 00:45:59.562
So, the Nine Realms.

00:45:59.995 --> 00:46:02.748
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.

00:46:02.831 --> 00:46:04.300
This is Alfheim.

00:46:04.666 --> 00:46:06.043
Vanaheim.

00:46:06.401 --> 00:46:07.876
Jotunheim.

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:09.662
And Asgard.

00:46:10.005 --> 00:46:11.919
And that's where I come from.

00:46:29.357 --> 00:46:31.000
Thank you, Jane.

00:46:39.685 --> 00:46:40.967
Jarvis!

00:46:41.074 --> 00:46:42.834
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

00:46:46.246 --> 00:46:48.071
I am Iron Man.

00:46:49.088 --> 00:46:51.832
You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

00:46:52.085 --> 00:46:55.339
Mr. Stark, you've become
part of a bigger universe.

00:46:55.422 --> 00:46:57.554
You just don't know it yet.

00:46:57.637 --> 00:46:59.005
Who the hell are you?

00:46:59.676 --> 00:47:00.794
Nick Fury…

00:47:00.877 --> 00:47:02.483
Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:47:04.511 --> 00:47:07.105
I'm here to talk to you about
the Avenger Initiative.
