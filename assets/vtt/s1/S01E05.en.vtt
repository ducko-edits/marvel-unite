WEBVTT

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.999
We should never have let him go.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.679
There was no stopping him.

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:31.759
Well, at least he's only
banished, not dead.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.159
Which is what we'd all be

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.959
if that guard hadn't told
Odin where we'd gone.

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:43.839
How did the guard even know?

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:45.359
I told him.

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:47.879
What?

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.559
I told him to go to
Odin after we'd left.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.399
He should be flogged
for taking so long.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:53.679
We should never have
reached Jotunheim.

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:54.839
You told the guard?

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:56.879
I saved our lives.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.839
And Thor's.

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.359
I had no idea Father would
banish him for what he did.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.559
Loki.

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.159
You must go to the Allfather and
convince him to change his mind.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:09.839
And if I do, then what?

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:13.159
I love Thor more dearly than any
of you, but you know what he is.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.999
He's arrogant. He's reckless.
He's dangerous.

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.039
You saw how he was today.

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.399
Is that what Asgard
needs from its king?

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.799
He may speak of
the good of Asgard,

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:29.239
but he's always
been jealous of Thor.

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:32.399
We should be grateful
to him, he saved our lives.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.599
Laufey said

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.199
there were traitors
in the House of Odin.

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:42.079
A master of magic could
bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:45.599
Loki's always been
one for mischief,

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.119
but you're talking about
something else entirely.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.959
Stop!

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.119
Am I cursed?

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.639
No.

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:21.959
What am I?

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:24.479
You're my son.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.639
What more than that?

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.999
The Casket wasn't the only thing

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.319
you took from
Jotunheim that day,

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:45.159
was it?

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.279
No.

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:56.479
In the aftermath of the battle,

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.479
I went into the temple
and I found a baby.

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:06.679
<i>Small for a giant's offspring.</i>

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.519
<i>Abandoned, suffering,
left to die.</i>

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.679
<i>Laufey's son.</i>

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.199
Laufey's son.

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.039
Yes.

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.679
Why?

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.359
You were knee-deep in Jotun
blood, why would you take me?

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.999
You were an innocent child.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:35.039
No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.719
Tell me!

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.199
I thought we could unite
our kingdoms one day.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.679
Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:50.359
Through you.

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:51.559
What?

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.039
But those plans
no longer matter.

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:59.839
So I am no more than
another stolen relic,

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.359
locked up here until you
might have use of me.

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.919
Why do you twist my words?

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:06.039
You could have told me
what I was from the beginning,

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.079
why didn't you?

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.519
You're my son.

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.599
I wanted only to protect
you from the truth.

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:14.239
Because I'm the monster

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.399
parents tell their
children about at night?

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:18.599
- No, no.
- You know, it all makes sense now!

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.439
Why you favored
Thor all these years!

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:24.399
Because no matter how
much you claim to love me,

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.479
you could never
have a Frost Giant

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:28.079
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:49.439
Guards!

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.439
Guards, please, help!

00:05:26.658 --> 00:05:28.338
<i>270 at 30 knots.</i>

00:05:28.418 --> 00:05:30.298

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:26.115
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:28.595
Oh! It's good to be back.

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:32.195
- You missed me?
- Blow something up!

00:07:32.275 --> 00:07:34.755
I missed you, too.
Blow something up? I already did that.

00:07:36.595 --> 00:07:39.795
I'm not saying that
the world is enjoying

00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:43.995
its longest period of uninterrupted
peace in years because of me.

00:07:46.955 --> 00:07:52.755
I'm not saying that from
the ashes of captivity,

00:07:53.395 --> 00:07:57.915
never has a greater phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:06.875
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam
can kick back on a lawn chair,

00:08:06.955 --> 00:08:08.555
sipping on an iced tea

00:08:08.675 --> 00:08:11.715
because I haven't come across
anyone who's man enough

00:08:11.795 --> 00:08:14.715
to go toe-to-toe with
me on my best day.

00:08:19.075 --> 00:08:20.355
I love you, Tony!

00:08:20.435 --> 00:08:22.515
Please, it's not about me.

00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:25.675
It's not about you.

00:08:27.955 --> 00:08:30.955
It's not even about us.
It's about legacy.

00:08:31.795 --> 00:08:34.755
It's about what we choose to
leave behind for future generations.

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:37.075
And that's why for the next year

00:08:37.155 --> 00:08:39.035
and for the first
time since 1974,

00:08:39.115 --> 00:08:41.515
the best and brightest
men and women

00:08:41.595 --> 00:08:43.555
of nations and
corporations the world over

00:08:43.675 --> 00:08:47.115
will pool their resources,
share their collective vision,

00:08:47.195 --> 00:08:49.755
to leave behind
a brighter future.

00:08:49.835 --> 00:08:51.835
It's not about us.

00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:56.115
Therefore, what I'm
saying, if I'm saying anything,

00:08:56.195 --> 00:08:58.795
is welcome back
to the Stark Expo.

00:09:02.515 --> 00:09:06.075
And now, making a special guest
appearance from the great beyond

00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:07.715
to tell you what it's all about,

00:09:07.795 --> 00:09:10.315
please welcome
my father, Howard.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.595
<i>Everything is achievable
through technology.</i>

00:09:15.675 --> 00:09:17.995
<i>Better living, robust health,</i>

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.715
<i>and for the first time
in human history,</i>

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:22.995
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:24.995
<i>So, from all of us
here at Stark Industries,</i>

00:09:25.075 --> 00:09:29.915
<i>I would like to personally introduce
you to the City of the Future.</i>

00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:33.755
<i>Technology holds infinite
possibilities for mankind,</i>

00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:36.635
<i>and will one day rid
society of all its ills.</i>

00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:40.315
<i>Soon, technology will affect the
way you live your life every day.</i>

00:09:40.395 --> 00:09:41.995
<i>No more tedious work,</i>

00:09:42.235 --> 00:09:46.675
<i>leaving more time for leisure
activities and enjoying the sweet life.</i>

00:09:46.755 --> 00:09:49.515
<i>The Stark Expo. Welcome.</i>

00:09:54.675 --> 00:09:57.595
<i>We are coming to you live
from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,</i>

00:09:57.675 --> 00:10:00.595
<i>where Tony Stark has
just walked offstage.</i>

00:10:00.675 --> 00:10:02.275
<i>Don't worry if you can't
make it down here tonight</i>

00:10:02.355 --> 00:10:04.795
<i>because this Expo
goes on all year long.</i>

00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:06.835
<i>And I'm gonna be here
checking out all the attractions</i>

00:10:06.915 --> 00:10:10.435
<i>and the pavilions and the
inventions from all around the world.</i>

00:10:10.515 --> 00:10:11.515
<i>Make sure you join me...</i>

00:10:11.595 --> 00:10:12.995
All right, it's a zoo
out there, watch out.

00:10:13.075 --> 00:10:14.075
Open up, let's go.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:15.955
Hey! Nice to see you.

00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:17.275
All right. Thank you.
I remember you.

00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:18.555
Tony, Tony...

00:10:18.635 --> 00:10:19.635
Hey, hey...

00:10:19.715 --> 00:10:20.715
Call me.

00:10:20.795 --> 00:10:22.635
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.

00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:25.195
Hello. It would be a pleasure.

00:10:25.275 --> 00:10:26.795
- Okay.
- See you, buddy.

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:27.955
This is Larry.

00:10:28.035 --> 00:10:29.395
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.

00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:30.475
What a pleasure.
Nice to see you.

00:10:30.555 --> 00:10:31.795
Call me. Call me.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:33.635
- Larry King.
- Larry!

00:10:34.115 --> 00:10:36.475
Ah, yes, my people, my people.

00:10:36.555 --> 00:10:38.115
- Come on, Tony.
- There we go.

00:10:38.195 --> 00:10:40.075
- Very mellow.
- That wasn't so bad.

00:10:40.155 --> 00:10:41.435
No, it was perfect.

00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:42.995
Look what we got
here, the new model.

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:44.795
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:45.995
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:10:46.075 --> 00:10:47.235
- And you are?
- Marshal.

00:10:47.315 --> 00:10:49.275
- Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you, Tony.

00:10:49.355 --> 00:10:51.515
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind?
Where you from?

00:10:51.595 --> 00:10:52.835
- Bedford.
- What are you doing here?

00:10:52.915 --> 00:10:53.915
Looking for you.

00:10:53.995 --> 00:10:55.635
Yeah? You found me.

00:10:57.075 --> 00:10:58.115
What are you up to later?

00:10:58.195 --> 00:11:00.195
Serving subpoenas.

00:11:00.595 --> 00:11:01.755
Yikes.

00:11:02.675 --> 00:11:03.835
He doesn't like to
be handed things.

00:11:03.915 --> 00:11:05.515
- Yeah, I have a peeve.
- I got it.

00:11:05.595 --> 00:11:07.195
You are hereby ordered to appear

00:11:07.315 --> 00:11:09.035
before the Senate Armed
Services Committee

00:11:09.115 --> 00:11:10.795
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:12.475
- Can I see a badge?
- You wanna see the badge?

00:11:12.555 --> 00:11:14.835
He likes the badge.

00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:15.915
You still like it?

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:17.035
Yep.

00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:20.395
How far are we from D.C.?

00:11:20.475 --> 00:11:22.195
D.C.? 250 miles.

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:34.574
How long will it last?

00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:38.928
He's put it off for so
long now, that I fear...

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.950
So why did he lie?

00:11:44.802 --> 00:11:49.042
He kept the truth from you so
that you would never feel different.

00:11:49.162 --> 00:11:51.482
You are our son, Loki,

00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:54.122
and we, your family.

00:11:56.002 --> 00:12:00.002
We mustn't lose hope that
your father will return to us.

00:12:01.162 --> 00:12:02.642
And your brother.

00:12:04.042 --> 00:12:05.882
What hope is there for Thor?

00:12:06.162 --> 00:12:09.722
There's always a purpose to
everything your father does.

00:12:13.497 --> 00:12:16.537
Allfather, we must
speak with you urgently.

00:12:29.377 --> 00:12:31.377
My friends.

00:12:31.697 --> 00:12:33.377
Where's Odin?

00:12:33.577 --> 00:12:36.537
Father has fallen
into the Odinsleep.

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:40.697
Mother fears he may
never awaken again.

00:12:41.217 --> 00:12:42.417
We would speak with her.

00:12:42.577 --> 00:12:45.737
She has refused to
leave my father's bedside.

00:12:48.057 --> 00:12:50.777
You can bring your
urgent matter to me.

00:12:58.217 --> 00:12:59.577
Your king.

00:13:10.777 --> 00:13:15.137
My King, we would ask that
you end Thor's banishment.

00:13:19.777 --> 00:13:23.177
My first command cannot
be to undo the Allfather's last.

00:13:25.977 --> 00:13:28.457
We're on the brink
of war with Jotunheim.

00:13:29.617 --> 00:13:32.457
Our people need a
sense of continuity,

00:13:32.617 --> 00:13:35.337
in order to feel safe
in these difficult times.

00:13:36.617 --> 00:13:38.337
All of us must stand together

00:13:39.177 --> 00:13:40.857
for the good of Asgard.

00:13:43.337 --> 00:13:44.937
Yes, of course.

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:47.137
Good. Then you will
wait for my word.

00:13:47.473 --> 00:13:48.513
If I may

00:13:49.857 --> 00:13:54.377
beg the indulgence of Your
Majesty to perhaps reconsider...

00:13:54.537 --> 00:13:55.697
We're done!

00:14:15.099 --> 00:14:16.259
You made my men,

00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:18.739
some of the most highly
trained professionals in the world,

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:21.619
look like a bunch of
minimum-wage mall cops.

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:24.699
That's hurtful.

00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:27.179
In my experience,

00:14:27.259 --> 00:14:29.259
it takes someone who's
received similar training

00:14:29.739 --> 00:14:30.779
to do what you did to them.

00:14:32.419 --> 00:14:34.939
Why don't you tell me where
you received your training?

00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:38.899
Pakistan? Chechnya?
Afghanistan?

00:14:40.099 --> 00:14:43.419
No, you strike me more as
the soldier of fortune type.

00:14:44.219 --> 00:14:47.059
Where was it?
South Africa?

00:14:48.579 --> 00:14:52.459
Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.

00:14:54.779 --> 00:14:56.259
Who are you?

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:03.619
One way or another, we
find out what we need to know.

00:15:03.979 --> 00:15:05.299
We're good at that.

00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:12.339
Don't go anywhere.

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:21.299
Loki! What are you doing here?

00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:23.139
I had to see you.

00:15:24.819 --> 00:15:26.139
What's happened?

00:15:26.499 --> 00:15:28.499
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:30.299
Let me explain to Father.

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:31.659
Father is dead.

00:15:37.819 --> 00:15:39.179
What?

00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:42.659
Your banishment,

00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:45.819
the threat of a new war,

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:48.659
it was too much for him to bear.

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:53.499
You mustn't blame yourself.

00:15:54.339 --> 00:15:55.859
I know that you loved him.

00:15:56.819 --> 00:15:59.499
I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.

00:16:01.739 --> 00:16:04.019
It was so cruel to put the
hammer within your reach,

00:16:04.139 --> 00:16:06.059
knowing that you
could never lift it.

00:16:09.419 --> 00:16:12.219
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

00:16:18.259 --> 00:16:19.899
Can I come home?

00:16:20.859 --> 00:16:23.899
The truce with Jotunheim is
conditional upon your exile.

00:16:24.219 --> 00:16:26.139
Yes, but couldn't
we find a way...

00:16:26.219 --> 00:16:30.339
And Mother has
forbidden your return.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:35.259
This is goodbye, Brother.

00:16:37.739 --> 00:16:39.619
I'm so sorry.

00:16:45.219 --> 00:16:46.379
No.

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:49.579
I am sorry.

00:16:54.939 --> 00:16:57.259
Thank you for coming here.

00:17:01.739 --> 00:17:03.099
Farewell.

00:17:16.139 --> 00:17:17.419
Goodbye.

00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:19.419
Goodbye?

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:21.299
I just got back.

00:18:06.505 --> 00:18:09.625
The fifth one was here in
Poland, right near the Baltic.

00:18:09.665 --> 00:18:11.825
And the sixth one was

00:18:12.345 --> 00:18:17.345
about here, 30, 40 miles
west of the Maginot Line.

00:18:19.145 --> 00:18:21.025
I just got a quick look.

00:18:21.665 --> 00:18:23.705
Well, nobody's perfect.

00:18:26.985 --> 00:18:29.345
These are the weapon
factories we know about.

00:18:29.825 --> 00:18:31.545
Sergeant Barnes
said that Hydra shipped

00:18:31.625 --> 00:18:34.305
all the parts to another
facility that isn't on this map.

00:18:34.345 --> 00:18:36.025
Agent Carter,
coordinate with MI6.

00:18:36.105 --> 00:18:38.825
I want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.

00:18:38.865 --> 00:18:39.945
What about us?

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:42.825
We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidt's ass.

00:18:42.865 --> 00:18:44.865
What do you say, Rogers?
It's your map.

00:18:44.945 --> 00:18:48.585
You think you can wipe Hydra off it?
Yes, sir. I'll need a team.

00:18:48.985 --> 00:18:51.065
We're already putting
together the best men.

00:18:51.385 --> 00:18:54.225
With all due
respect, sir, so am I.

00:18:55.545 --> 00:18:56.985
So, let's get this straight.

00:18:57.025 --> 00:18:59.065
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

00:19:00.745 --> 00:19:02.025
Pretty much.

00:19:02.105 --> 00:19:04.425
Sounds rather fun, actually.

00:19:06.105 --> 00:19:07.105
I'm in.

00:19:19.745 --> 00:19:21.065
We're in.

00:19:22.025 --> 00:19:25.305
Hell, I'll always fight.
But you got to do one thing for me.

00:19:25.385 --> 00:19:26.385
What's that?

00:19:28.545 --> 00:19:29.585
Open a tab.

00:19:33.425 --> 00:19:34.905
Well, that was easy.

00:19:35.265 --> 00:19:37.705
- Another round.
- Where are they putting all this stuff?

00:19:41.745 --> 00:19:43.945
See? I told you.

00:19:44.545 --> 00:19:46.545
They're all idiots.

00:19:47.105 --> 00:19:48.425
How about you?

00:19:49.225 --> 00:19:52.265
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?

00:19:52.585 --> 00:19:53.745
Hell, no.

00:19:53.785 --> 00:19:58.265
That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:01.105
I'm following him.

00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:06.025
But you're keeping
the outfit, right?

00:20:08.905 --> 00:20:10.025
You know what?

00:20:11.265 --> 00:20:12.745
It's kind of growing on me.

00:20:23.905 --> 00:20:25.305
- Captain.
- Agent Carter.

00:20:28.025 --> 00:20:29.025
Ma'am.

00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:30.665
Howard has some
equipment for you to try.

00:20:30.745 --> 00:20:32.105
Tomorrow morning?

00:20:32.145 --> 00:20:33.465
Sounds good.

00:20:38.145 --> 00:20:40.905
I see your top squad
is prepping for duty.

00:20:41.305 --> 00:20:42.345
You don't like music?

00:20:42.425 --> 00:20:43.785
I do, actually.

00:20:45.585 --> 00:20:48.985
I might even, when this
is all over, go dancing.

00:20:49.065 --> 00:20:50.425
Then what are we waiting for?

00:20:51.665 --> 00:20:53.265
The right partner.

00:20:54.345 --> 00:20:55.665
0800, Captain.

00:20:56.825 --> 00:20:59.185
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.

00:20:59.505 --> 00:21:01.105
I'm invisible.

00:21:01.585 --> 00:21:04.665
I'm turning into you.
It's like a horrible dream.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:08.345
Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.

00:21:12.026 --> 00:21:14.146
Mr. Stark, could we pick
up now where we left off?

00:21:15.306 --> 00:21:16.826
Mr. Stark. Please.

00:21:16.906 --> 00:21:18.506
- Yes, dear?
- Can I have your attention?

00:21:18.586 --> 00:21:19.666
Absolutely.

00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:22.706
Do you or do you not
possess a specialized weapon?

00:21:22.786 --> 00:21:24.586
- I do not.
- You do not?

00:21:24.666 --> 00:21:27.226
I do not. Well, it depends on
how you define the word "weapon."

00:21:27.306 --> 00:21:28.546
The Iron Man weapon.

00:21:28.626 --> 00:21:30.426
My device does not
fit that description.

00:21:30.506 --> 00:21:32.226
Well... How would
you describe it?

00:21:32.306 --> 00:21:35.306
I would describe it by
defining it as what it is, Senator.

00:21:35.386 --> 00:21:36.386
As?

00:21:36.466 --> 00:21:38.306
It's a high-tech prosthesis.

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:40.506
That is...
That is...

00:21:40.586 --> 00:21:42.706
That's actually the most apt
description I can make of it.

00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:44.706
It's a weapon.
It's a weapon, Mr. Stark.

00:21:44.786 --> 00:21:47.866
Please, if your priority was actually
the well-being of the American citizen...

00:21:47.946 --> 00:21:50.826
My priority is to get the Iron Man
weapon turned over to the people

00:21:50.906 --> 00:21:52.066
of the United States of America.

00:21:52.146 --> 00:21:54.266
Well, you can forget it.

00:21:54.826 --> 00:21:58.626
I am Iron Man.
The suit and I are one.

00:21:58.706 --> 00:22:01.146
To turn over the Iron Man suit
would be to turn over myself,

00:22:01.266 --> 00:22:04.226
which is tantamount to
indentured servitude or prostitution,

00:22:04.346 --> 00:22:05.986
depending on
what state you're in.

00:22:06.066 --> 00:22:07.106
You can't have it.

00:22:07.186 --> 00:22:09.026
Look, I'm no expert...

00:22:09.106 --> 00:22:11.666
In prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator. Come on.

00:22:13.826 --> 00:22:16.346
I'm no expert in weapons.

00:22:16.426 --> 00:22:18.226
We have somebody here
who is an expert on weapons.

00:22:18.346 --> 00:22:20.586
I'd now like to call
Justin Hammer,

00:22:20.666 --> 00:22:23.106
our current primary
weapons contractor.

00:22:24.106 --> 00:22:27.586
Let the record reflect that I observed
Mr. Hammer entering the chamber,

00:22:27.666 --> 00:22:29.026
and I am wondering

00:22:29.106 --> 00:22:32.426
if and when any actual expert
will also be in attendance.

00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:42.186
Absolutely. I'm no expert. I defer to
you, Anthony. You're the wonder boy.

00:22:43.266 --> 00:22:47.426
Senator, if I may.
I may well not be an expert,

00:22:47.506 --> 00:22:49.946
but you know who was the expert?

00:22:50.026 --> 00:22:52.666
Your dad. Howard Stark.

00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:57.186
Really a father to us all, and
to the military-industrial age.

00:22:57.746 --> 00:23:01.426
Let's just be clear.
He was no flower child. He was a lion.

00:23:02.386 --> 00:23:04.826
We all know why we're here.
In the last six months,

00:23:04.906 --> 00:23:09.026
Anthony Stark has created a
sword with untold possibilities.

00:23:09.106 --> 00:23:11.946
And yet he
insists it's a shield.

00:23:12.026 --> 00:23:16.666
He asks us to trust him
as we cower behind it.

00:23:16.746 --> 00:23:19.986
I wish I were comforted,
Anthony, I really do.

00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:23.186
I'd love to leave my door
unlocked when I leave the house,

00:23:23.266 --> 00:23:24.746
but this ain't Canada.

00:23:24.826 --> 00:23:26.506
You know, we live in a
world of grave threats,

00:23:26.586 --> 00:23:30.346
threats that Mr. Stark will
not always be able to foresee.

00:23:31.426 --> 00:23:35.666
Thank you. God bless Iron Man.
God bless America.

00:23:36.746 --> 00:23:38.866
That is well said, Mr. Hammer.

00:23:38.946 --> 00:23:40.946
The committee would
now like to invite

00:23:41.026 --> 00:23:44.146
Lieutenant Colonel James
Rhodes to the chamber.

00:23:44.226 --> 00:23:45.746
Rhodey? What?

00:23:52.066 --> 00:23:55.306
Hey, buddy.
I didn't expect to see you here.

00:23:55.386 --> 00:23:58.026
Look, it's me, I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

00:23:58.106 --> 00:23:59.186
I just...

00:23:59.266 --> 00:24:00.706
- Drop it.
- All right, I'll drop it.

00:24:00.786 --> 00:24:04.306
I have before me a complete
report on the Iron Man weapon,

00:24:04.386 --> 00:24:07.026
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
And, Colonel, for the record,

00:24:07.106 --> 00:24:10.266
can you please read
page 57, paragraph four?

00:24:10.346 --> 00:24:12.626
You're requesting that I
read specific selections

00:24:12.706 --> 00:24:13.986
- from my report, Senator?
- Yes, sir.

00:24:14.066 --> 00:24:15.986
It was my understanding
that I was going to be testifying

00:24:16.106 --> 00:24:18.266
in a much more comprehensive
and detailed manner.

00:24:18.346 --> 00:24:19.986
I understand.
A lot of things have changed today.

00:24:20.066 --> 00:24:21.346
- So if you could just read...
- You do understand

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:23.826
that reading a single paragraph
out of context does not reflect

00:24:23.946 --> 00:24:25.226
the summary of my final...

00:24:25.306 --> 00:24:27.186
Just read it, Colonel.
I do. Thank you.

00:24:28.266 --> 00:24:29.626
Very well.

00:24:31.586 --> 00:24:34.906
"As he does not operate within
any definable branch of government,

00:24:36.866 --> 00:24:38.866
"Iron Man presents
a potential threat

00:24:38.946 --> 00:24:40.986
"to the security
of both the nation

00:24:41.066 --> 00:24:42.506
"and to her interests."

00:24:42.586 --> 00:24:45.546
I did, however, go on to summarize
that the benefits of Iron Man

00:24:45.626 --> 00:24:47.266
- far outweigh the liabilities.
- Uh... Uh... Uh...

00:24:47.346 --> 00:24:48.426
And that it would
be in our interest...

00:24:48.506 --> 00:24:49.506
That's enough, Colonel.

00:24:49.586 --> 00:24:50.746
- ...to fold Mr. Stark...
- That's enough.

00:24:50.826 --> 00:24:52.386
...into the existing chain
of command, Senator.

00:24:52.466 --> 00:24:53.706
I'm not a joiner,
but I'll consider

00:24:53.786 --> 00:24:55.346
Secretary of Defense,
if you ask nice.

00:24:56.506 --> 00:24:58.546
We can amend
the hours a little bit.

00:24:59.266 --> 00:25:01.026
I'd like to go on
and show, if I may,

00:25:01.106 --> 00:25:03.266
the imagery that's
connected to your report.

00:25:03.346 --> 00:25:05.826
I believe it is somewhat
premature to reveal these images

00:25:05.946 --> 00:25:07.026
to the general
public at this time.

00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:08.106
With all due respect,

00:25:08.186 --> 00:25:09.386
Colonel, I understand.

00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:13.546
And if you could just narrate
those for us, we'd be very grateful.

00:25:13.666 --> 00:25:15.586
Let's have the images.

00:25:17.026 --> 00:25:20.266
Intelligence suggests that the
devices seen in these photos

00:25:20.346 --> 00:25:22.146
are, in fact, attempts at making

00:25:22.226 --> 00:25:24.786
manned copies
of Mr. Stark's suit.

00:25:24.866 --> 00:25:29.906
This has been corroborated by our allies
and local intelligence on the ground,

00:25:29.986 --> 00:25:35.106
indicating that these suits are quite
possibly, at this moment, operational.

00:25:35.546 --> 00:25:39.026
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see something here.

00:25:39.146 --> 00:25:42.746
Oh! Boy, I'm good.
I commandeered your screens.

00:25:43.466 --> 00:25:46.466
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

00:25:46.546 --> 00:25:48.306
Now, let's see what's really going on.
What is he doing?

00:25:48.386 --> 00:25:51.626
If you will direct your
attention to said screens...

00:25:51.746 --> 00:25:53.306
I believe that's North Korea.

00:26:01.506 --> 00:26:04.386
Can you turn that off?
Take it off.

00:26:04.506 --> 00:26:05.666
Iran.

00:26:09.106 --> 00:26:11.946
No grave immediate threat here.

00:26:12.026 --> 00:26:15.386
Is that Justin Hammer?
How did Hammer get in the game?

00:26:16.506 --> 00:26:17.866
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

00:26:19.106 --> 00:26:20.826
<i>Okay, give me a left twist.</i>

00:26:20.906 --> 00:26:22.946
<i>Left's good. Turn to the right.</i>

00:26:25.386 --> 00:26:28.146
<i>Oh, shit. Oh, shit!</i>

00:26:28.226 --> 00:26:29.386
Wow.

00:26:30.306 --> 00:26:34.146
Yeah, I'd say most
countries, five, 10 years away.

00:26:34.226 --> 00:26:35.506
Hammer Industries, 20.

00:26:35.586 --> 00:26:38.106
I'd like to point out that
that test pilot survived.

00:26:38.186 --> 00:26:39.866
I think we're done, is
the point that he's making.

00:26:39.946 --> 00:26:41.466
I don't think
there's any reason...

00:26:41.586 --> 00:26:42.786
The point is, you're
welcome, I guess.

00:26:42.866 --> 00:26:43.866
For what?

00:26:43.946 --> 00:26:46.066
Because I'm your
nuclear deterrent.

00:26:46.186 --> 00:26:48.706
It's working. We're safe.
America is secure.

00:26:48.786 --> 00:26:50.706
You want my property?
You can't have it.

00:26:50.786 --> 00:26:52.146
But I did you a big favor.

00:26:52.946 --> 00:26:55.826
I've successfully
privatized world peace.

00:26:58.666 --> 00:27:01.266
What more do you want?
For now!

00:27:02.306 --> 00:27:04.906
I tried to play ball
with these ass-clowns.

00:27:05.026 --> 00:27:08.386
<i>[bleep] you, Mr. Stark.</i>
<i>[bleep] you, buddy.</i>

00:27:08.626 --> 00:27:10.586
We're adjourned.
We're adjourned for today.

00:27:10.666 --> 00:27:11.666
Okay.

00:27:11.746 --> 00:27:12.986
You've been a delight.

00:27:18.682 --> 00:27:20.682
He committed a crime.
He's in jail!

00:27:20.802 --> 00:27:22.362
I can't just leave him there!

00:27:22.442 --> 00:27:23.162
Why?

00:27:23.242 --> 00:27:25.162
You didn't see what I saw!

00:27:25.242 --> 00:27:27.522
Look! Look, it's Myeu-muh.

00:27:32.202 --> 00:27:33.362
Where'd you find this?

00:27:33.642 --> 00:27:34.802
The children's section.

00:27:34.842 --> 00:27:37.322
I just wanted to show
you how silly his story was.

00:27:37.362 --> 00:27:39.322
But you're the one
who's always pushing me

00:27:39.362 --> 00:27:41.482
to chase down every
possibility, every alternative!

00:27:41.602 --> 00:27:43.802
I'm talking about
science, not magic!

00:27:43.882 --> 00:27:46.162
Well, magic's just science
that we don't understand yet.

00:27:46.282 --> 00:27:47.402
Arthur C. Clarke.

00:27:47.482 --> 00:27:48.882
Who wrote science fiction.

00:27:49.002 --> 00:27:50.322
A precursor to science fact!

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:51.482
In some cases, yeah.

00:27:51.522 --> 00:27:53.202
Well, if there is an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

00:27:53.322 --> 00:27:54.682
then there's something
on the other side.

00:27:54.802 --> 00:27:56.482
And advanced beings
could have crossed it!

00:27:56.682 --> 00:27:57.682
Jane.

00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:59.242
A primitive culture
like the Vikings

00:27:59.322 --> 00:28:00.722
might have worshipped
them as deities.

00:28:00.842 --> 00:28:02.562
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

00:28:02.682 --> 00:28:04.122
Mmm-hmm.

00:28:13.495 --> 00:28:15.175
His name is Donald Blake?

00:28:15.455 --> 00:28:17.135
Dr. Donald Blake.

00:28:17.295 --> 00:28:19.095
You have dangerous
coworkers, Dr. Selvig.

00:28:19.335 --> 00:28:21.255
He was distraught
when he found out

00:28:21.295 --> 00:28:23.175
that you've taken
all our research.

00:28:23.815 --> 00:28:26.295
That was years
of his life, gone!

00:28:28.175 --> 00:28:30.695
You can understand how
a man could go off like that.

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:33.095
A big, faceless
organization like yours

00:28:33.135 --> 00:28:35.735
coming in with their
jackbooted thugs and...

00:28:37.295 --> 00:28:38.695
That's how he put it.

00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:39.935
That still doesn't explain

00:28:39.975 --> 00:28:41.655
how he managed to
tear through our security.

00:28:41.975 --> 00:28:45.335
Steroids!
He's a bit of a fitness nut.

00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:48.175
Sir?

00:28:52.815 --> 00:28:54.175
It says here that he's an M.D.

00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:56.655
Well, he is! Or he was.

00:28:56.775 --> 00:28:59.335
He switched careers
and became a physicist.

00:28:59.495 --> 00:29:01.335
A brilliant physicist.

00:29:01.375 --> 00:29:03.695
He's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.

00:29:06.175 --> 00:29:08.895
Oh, Donny, Donny, Donny!

00:29:09.375 --> 00:29:13.375
There you are. You're gonna be all right.
I'm taking you home now.

00:29:27.855 --> 00:29:29.375
Dr. Selvig!

00:29:30.415 --> 00:29:32.855
Just keep him
away from the bars.

00:29:33.375 --> 00:29:34.695
I will!

00:29:36.535 --> 00:29:37.935
Where are we going?

00:29:38.015 --> 00:29:39.375
To get a drink.

00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:41.055
Follow them.

00:29:47.415 --> 00:29:49.615
You know, I had
it all backwards.

00:29:51.735 --> 00:29:53.215
I had it all wrong.

00:29:56.615 --> 00:30:00.255
It's not a bad thing finding out
that you don't have all the answers.

00:30:00.735 --> 00:30:02.575
You start asking
the right questions.

00:30:06.735 --> 00:30:10.735
For the first time in my life,

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:15.415
I have no idea what
I'm supposed to do.

00:30:16.455 --> 00:30:19.415
Anyone who's ever going
to find his way in this world

00:30:19.535 --> 00:30:22.615
has to start by admitting he
doesn't know where the hell he is.

00:30:24.575 --> 00:30:26.215
Thank you for what you've done.

00:30:26.295 --> 00:30:28.815
No, don't thank me.
I only did it for Jane.

00:30:30.255 --> 00:30:32.935
Her father and I taught
at university together.

00:30:33.255 --> 00:30:34.815
He was a good man.

00:30:35.815 --> 00:30:36.935
He never listened.

00:30:38.255 --> 00:30:39.815
Neither did I.

00:30:41.095 --> 00:30:43.135
My father was trying
to teach me something,

00:30:43.255 --> 00:30:45.135
but I was too stupid to see it.

00:30:46.255 --> 00:30:48.295
I don't know if
you're delusional

00:30:48.335 --> 00:30:50.295
or if you're pulling
some kind of con,

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:51.735
I don't care.

00:30:51.775 --> 00:30:53.135
I just care about her.

00:30:54.495 --> 00:30:56.935
I've seen the way
she looks at you.

00:31:00.295 --> 00:31:02.815
I swear to you, I
mean her no harm.

00:31:03.135 --> 00:31:04.135
Good.

00:31:04.815 --> 00:31:08.815
In that case, I'll buy you another
round, and you leave town tonight.

00:31:13.975 --> 00:31:15.815
Two boilermakers.

00:31:54.235 --> 00:31:56.235
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

00:31:56.555 --> 00:31:58.555
He's fine. Not injured at all.

00:31:59.515 --> 00:32:01.035
I'm sorry, my friend.

00:32:01.155 --> 00:32:02.915
- What happened?
- We drank, we fought,

00:32:03.035 --> 00:32:04.515
he made his ancestors proud.

00:32:04.995 --> 00:32:06.835
Put him on the bed.

00:32:18.035 --> 00:32:21.595
I still don't think you're
the God of Thunder.

00:32:22.235 --> 00:32:24.435
But you ought to be.

00:32:35.555 --> 00:32:37.075
Are these your chambers?

00:32:37.435 --> 00:32:41.115
It's more of a
temporary living situation.

00:32:41.955 --> 00:32:45.795
I'm sorry.
I don't usually have guests.

00:32:46.435 --> 00:32:49.515
Actually, I never have guests.

00:32:51.435 --> 00:32:53.635
That's not the
right place for it.

00:32:54.635 --> 00:32:56.275
I'm sorry.

00:32:59.435 --> 00:33:00.435
Can we go outside?

00:33:01.275 --> 00:33:02.755
Yes, of course.

00:33:08.275 --> 00:33:10.555
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep

00:33:10.595 --> 00:33:12.915
or I'm trying to
reconcile particle data,

00:33:13.035 --> 00:33:14.755
or when Darcy's
driving me crazy.

00:33:15.995 --> 00:33:19.315
I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

00:33:23.315 --> 00:33:25.275
I'm really glad you're safe.

00:33:26.315 --> 00:33:28.835
You've been very kind to me,

00:33:29.595 --> 00:33:31.795
and I've been far less
grateful than you deserve.

00:33:31.955 --> 00:33:33.635
Well, I hit you with
my car a couple times,

00:33:33.755 --> 00:33:35.795
so I think that kind
of evens things out.

00:33:38.155 --> 00:33:39.995
Perhaps I had it coming.

00:33:45.835 --> 00:33:47.195
Oh, my God!

00:33:48.475 --> 00:33:49.795
I don't believe it!

00:33:49.995 --> 00:33:53.475
It was all I could get back.
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

00:33:53.515 --> 00:33:55.835
No, no, this is great!
This is...

00:33:55.915 --> 00:33:58.195
I don't have to start
from scratch now.

00:33:58.515 --> 00:33:59.835
Thank you.

00:34:04.515 --> 00:34:05.995
What's wrong?

00:34:07.355 --> 00:34:08.355
S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:34:08.475 --> 00:34:09.835
Whatever they are,

00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:12.955
they're gonna do
everything in their power

00:34:12.995 --> 00:34:15.715
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

00:34:15.875 --> 00:34:17.195
No, Jane.

00:34:17.835 --> 00:34:19.715
Listen to me.
You must not give up.

00:34:19.995 --> 00:34:21.995
- You must finish what you've started.
- Why?

00:34:22.195 --> 00:34:23.835
Because you're right.

00:34:24.315 --> 00:34:25.675
Here, look.

00:34:28.235 --> 00:34:31.715
Your ancestors called it
magic, and you call it science.

00:34:32.355 --> 00:34:35.035
Well, I come from a place where
they're one and the same thing.

00:34:49.675 --> 00:34:51.235
What is that?

00:34:52.235 --> 00:34:55.355
My father explained
it to me like this,

00:34:55.475 --> 00:34:57.195
that your world

00:34:57.315 --> 00:35:00.155
is one of the Nine
Realms of the Cosmos,

00:35:00.195 --> 00:35:03.355
linked to each other by
the branches of Yggdrasil,

00:35:03.595 --> 00:35:05.555
the Worlds Tree.

00:35:05.755 --> 00:35:08.435
Now you see it every
day without realizing.

00:35:08.755 --> 00:35:10.395
The images glimpsed through...

00:35:10.435 --> 00:35:11.755
What did you call it?

00:35:12.275 --> 00:35:14.515
This Hooble Telescope.

00:35:14.595 --> 00:35:15.875
Hubble.

00:35:15.955 --> 00:35:17.435
Hubble Telescope.

00:35:20.555 --> 00:35:21.915
Tell me more.

00:35:22.435 --> 00:35:23.955
So, the Nine Realms.

00:35:24.595 --> 00:35:27.115
Now, there is
Midgard, which is Earth.

00:35:27.435 --> 00:35:28.955
This is Alfheim.

00:35:29.275 --> 00:35:31.955
Vanaheim. Jotunheim.

00:35:32.795 --> 00:35:34.115
And Asgard.

00:35:34.635 --> 00:35:36.555
<i>And that's where I come from.</i>

00:35:53.955 --> 00:35:55.315
Thank you, Jane.

00:36:01.353 --> 00:36:04.033
Emission signature is unusual.

00:36:04.513 --> 00:36:06.513
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

00:36:07.953 --> 00:36:10.353
Though I doubt Rogers
picked up on that.

00:36:12.033 --> 00:36:13.353
Seems harmless enough.

00:36:14.713 --> 00:36:16.633
Hard to see what
all the fuss is about.

00:36:26.113 --> 00:36:27.473
Write that down.

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:32.113
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Mr. Stark.

00:36:32.153 --> 00:36:34.313
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

00:36:39.033 --> 00:36:41.873
Of course, you're
welcome to wait.

00:36:48.513 --> 00:36:50.633
I read about what you did.

00:36:50.993 --> 00:36:52.633
Oh, the... Yeah.

00:36:53.393 --> 00:36:54.993
Well, that's, you know.

00:36:56.553 --> 00:36:58.033
Just doing what
needed to be done.

00:36:58.313 --> 00:37:01.193
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

00:37:07.513 --> 00:37:09.513
Really, it's not a big deal.

00:37:10.393 --> 00:37:12.553
Tell that to their wives.

00:37:14.753 --> 00:37:15.793
Uh,

00:37:15.873 --> 00:37:17.513
I don't think they
were all married.

00:37:17.673 --> 00:37:19.273
You're a hero.

00:37:19.353 --> 00:37:21.873
Well, that depends
on the definition, really.

00:37:21.913 --> 00:37:25.273
The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.

00:37:26.433 --> 00:37:29.393
And seeing as
they're not here...

00:37:38.073 --> 00:37:39.073
Captain!

00:37:39.153 --> 00:37:41.833
We're ready for you, if
you're not otherwise occupied.

00:37:42.913 --> 00:37:44.393
Agent Carter, wait.

00:37:44.713 --> 00:37:46.873
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

00:37:46.913 --> 00:37:48.593
Peggy, that's not
what you thought it was.

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:51.233
I don't think anything,
Captain, not one thing.

00:37:51.553 --> 00:37:53.673
You always wanted to be
a soldier, and now you are,

00:37:53.753 --> 00:37:55.193
just like all the rest.

00:37:55.433 --> 00:37:56.593
Well, what about you and Stark?

00:37:56.633 --> 00:37:59.113
How do I know you two
haven't been fondue-ing?

00:38:04.073 --> 00:38:06.393
You still don't know a
bloody thing about women.

00:38:07.913 --> 00:38:10.033
<i>Fondue is just cheese
and bread, my friend.</i>

00:38:10.113 --> 00:38:12.873
- Really? I didn't think...
- Nor should you, pal.

00:38:12.953 --> 00:38:14.993
The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head

00:38:15.073 --> 00:38:17.433
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

00:38:17.513 --> 00:38:20.233
Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment

00:38:20.273 --> 00:38:23.153
is about making sure you
and your men do not get killed.

00:38:23.393 --> 00:38:25.113
Carbon polymer.

00:38:25.793 --> 00:38:28.153
Should withstand your
average German bayonet.

00:38:28.233 --> 00:38:31.753
Although Hydra's not going to
attack you with a pocket knife.

00:38:32.073 --> 00:38:34.833
I hear you're kind of attached.

00:38:34.913 --> 00:38:36.313
It's handier than
you might think.

00:38:36.433 --> 00:38:38.593
I took the liberty of coming
up with some options.

00:38:39.273 --> 00:38:40.313
This one's fun.

00:38:41.113 --> 00:38:43.673
She's been fitted with electrical
relays that allow you to...

00:38:43.753 --> 00:38:45.353
- What about this one?
- No, no, that's just a prototype.

00:38:45.433 --> 00:38:47.593
- What's it made of?
- Vibranium.

00:38:48.633 --> 00:38:51.313
It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

00:38:51.913 --> 00:38:54.753
It's completely
vibration absorbent.

00:38:56.713 --> 00:38:58.313
How come it's not
standard issue?

00:38:58.393 --> 00:38:59.753
That's the rarest
metal on Earth.

00:38:59.833 --> 00:39:01.513
What you're holding there,
that's all we've got.

00:39:01.593 --> 00:39:03.833
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

00:39:03.913 --> 00:39:05.793
I'm sure the Captain has
some unfinished business.

00:39:05.833 --> 00:39:07.793
What do you think?

00:39:17.633 --> 00:39:19.633
Yes, I think it works.

00:39:28.873 --> 00:39:31.073
I had some ideas
about the uniform.

00:39:31.313 --> 00:39:32.833
Whatever you want, pal.

00:41:37.473 --> 00:41:39.833
You are failing!

00:41:40.713 --> 00:41:44.033
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet,

00:41:44.113 --> 00:41:46.073
yet we are continually delayed

00:41:46.153 --> 00:41:48.833
because you cannot outwit
a simpleton with a shield!

00:41:48.913 --> 00:41:50.913
This is hardly my
area of expertise.

00:41:50.993 --> 00:41:54.713
I merely developed the weapons.
I cannot fire them.

00:41:55.993 --> 00:41:57.553
Finish your mission, Doctor,

00:41:57.633 --> 00:41:59.273
before the American
finishes his.

00:41:59.993 --> 00:42:01.033
Sir!

00:42:03.353 --> 00:42:04.393
I'm sorry, <i>Herr</i> Schmidt.

00:42:05.913 --> 00:42:07.753
We fought to the last man.

00:42:10.993 --> 00:42:12.993
Evidently not.

00:42:23.081 --> 00:42:24.601
Wake up. Daddy's home.

00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:26.241
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:28.201
<i>Congratulations on
the opening ceremonies.</i>

00:42:28.281 --> 00:42:31.361
<i>They were such a success,
as was your Senate hearing.</i>

00:42:31.441 --> 00:42:33.161
<i>And may I say
how refreshing it is</i>

00:42:33.281 --> 00:42:36.161
<i>to finally see you in a video
with your clothing on, sir.</i>

00:42:38.921 --> 00:42:40.081
You!

00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:42.841
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.

00:42:42.921 --> 00:42:44.761
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

00:42:46.081 --> 00:42:49.441
How many ounces a day of this
gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?

00:42:49.521 --> 00:42:53.481
<i>We are up to 80 ounces a day
to counteract the symptoms, sir.</i>

00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:56.441
Check palladium levels.

00:42:58.361 --> 00:43:00.721
<i>Blood toxicity, 24%.</i>

00:43:02.161 --> 00:43:04.561
<i>It appears that the continued
use of the Iron Man suit</i>

00:43:04.641 --> 00:43:07.001
<i>is accelerating your condition.</i>

00:43:08.561 --> 00:43:10.921
<i>Another core has been depleted.</i>

00:43:14.361 --> 00:43:15.961
God, they're running out quick.

00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:18.721
<i>I have run simulations
on every known element,</i>

00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:22.921
<i>and none can serve as a viable
replacement for the palladium core.</i>

00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:28.241
<i>You are running out of
both time and options.</i>

00:43:31.961 --> 00:43:36.281
<i>Unfortunately, the device that's
keeping you alive is also killing you.</i>

00:43:38.081 --> 00:43:39.481
<i>Miss Potts is approaching.</i>

00:43:39.561 --> 00:43:41.321
<i>- I recommend that you inform her...</i>
- Mute.

00:43:44.881 --> 00:43:46.481
- Uh-uh.
- Is this a joke?

00:43:48.561 --> 00:43:50.201
- What are you thinking?
- What?

00:43:50.281 --> 00:43:51.321
What are you thinking?

00:43:51.401 --> 00:43:52.641
Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

00:43:52.721 --> 00:43:55.041
And you're angry
about something.

00:43:55.161 --> 00:43:56.521
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

00:43:56.601 --> 00:43:58.001
- Did you just donate...
- Keep your business.

00:43:58.121 --> 00:44:01.641
...our entire modern
art collection to the...

00:44:01.721 --> 00:44:03.361
- Boy Scouts of America.
- ...Boy Scouts of America?

00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:05.241
Yes. It is a
worthwhile organization.

00:44:05.321 --> 00:44:08.681
I didn't physically check
the crates but, basically, yes.

00:44:08.761 --> 00:44:09.801
And it's not "our"
collection, it's my collection.

00:44:09.921 --> 00:44:10.961
No offense.

00:44:11.041 --> 00:44:13.081
No, you know what?
I think I'm actually entitled

00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:14.761
to say "our" collection

00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:18.041
considering the time
that I put in, over 10 years,

00:44:18.121 --> 00:44:19.961
- curating that.
- It was a tax write-off.I needed that.

00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:23.121
You know, there's
only about 8,011 things

00:44:23.201 --> 00:44:24.921
that I really need
to talk to you about.

00:44:25.001 --> 00:44:26.721
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.

00:44:26.801 --> 00:44:28.241
The Bridgeport's already
machining that part.

00:44:28.361 --> 00:44:30.721
The Expo is a
gigantic waste of time.

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:33.041
I need you to wear a surgical
mask until you're feeling better.

00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:34.161
- Is that okay?
- That's rude.

00:44:34.281 --> 00:44:35.761
There's nothing more
important to me than the Expo.

00:44:35.841 --> 00:44:37.161
It's my primary
point of concern.

00:44:37.281 --> 00:44:38.281
I don't know why you're...

00:44:38.361 --> 00:44:40.441
The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

00:44:40.521 --> 00:44:42.281
Wow. Look at that.

00:44:43.521 --> 00:44:45.881
That's modern art.
That's going up.

00:44:45.961 --> 00:44:47.001
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

00:44:47.081 --> 00:44:48.721
I'm gonna put this up right now.

00:44:48.801 --> 00:44:49.801
This is vital.

00:44:49.881 --> 00:44:51.001
Stark is in complete disarray.

00:44:51.081 --> 00:44:52.081
You understand that?

00:44:52.161 --> 00:44:53.441
No. Our stocks have
never been higher.

00:44:53.521 --> 00:44:54.641
Yes, from a
managerial standpoint.

00:44:54.761 --> 00:44:55.841
You are... Well, if it's messy,

00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:57.441
- then let's double back.
- Let me give you an example.

00:44:57.521 --> 00:44:59.121
- Let's move on to another subject.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:44:59.201 --> 00:45:00.921
You are not taking
down the Barnett Newman

00:45:01.001 --> 00:45:02.481
- and hanging that up!
- I'm not taking it down.

00:45:02.601 --> 00:45:03.841
I'm just replacing it with this.

00:45:03.921 --> 00:45:05.281
- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Okay, fine.

00:45:05.361 --> 00:45:08.521
My point is, we have
already awarded contracts

00:45:08.601 --> 00:45:10.241
- to the wind farm people.
- Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

00:45:10.361 --> 00:45:11.321
I'm already feeling gassy.

00:45:11.441 --> 00:45:12.441
And to the plastic
plantation tree,

00:45:12.521 --> 00:45:13.521
which was your idea, by the way.

00:45:13.601 --> 00:45:14.641
Those people are on payroll...

00:45:14.721 --> 00:45:16.521
- Everything was my idea.
- ...and you won't make a decision.

00:45:16.601 --> 00:45:18.321
I don't care about the
liberal agenda anymore.

00:45:18.401 --> 00:45:20.761
It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.

00:45:20.841 --> 00:45:21.841
You do it.

00:45:21.921 --> 00:45:23.161
I do what?

00:45:23.241 --> 00:45:25.201
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.

00:45:25.281 --> 00:45:26.801
Yeah, I'm trying to
run the company.

00:45:26.881 --> 00:45:28.041
Pepper, I need you
to run the company.

00:45:28.121 --> 00:45:29.521
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not

00:45:29.601 --> 00:45:31.321
- give me the information I need...
- I'm not asking you to try...

00:45:31.401 --> 00:45:32.521
- ...in order to...
- I'm asking you

00:45:32.601 --> 00:45:33.801
to physically do it.
I need you to do it.

00:45:33.921 --> 00:45:35.641
- I am trying to do it.
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!

00:45:35.721 --> 00:45:37.641
- No, you are not listening to me.
- I'm trying to make you CEO.

00:45:37.721 --> 00:45:39.601
Why won't you let me?

00:45:40.121 --> 00:45:42.201
Have you been drinking?

00:45:42.281 --> 00:45:43.281
Chlorophyll.

00:45:45.081 --> 00:45:49.321
I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

00:45:49.401 --> 00:45:51.281
effective immediately.

00:45:53.481 --> 00:45:55.441
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

00:45:56.881 --> 00:45:59.481
I've actually given this
a fair amount of thought,

00:45:59.561 --> 00:46:03.481
believe it or not.
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:07.401
trying to figure out who a
worthy successor would be.

00:46:07.481 --> 00:46:09.321
And then I realized

00:46:11.801 --> 00:46:14.401
it's you.
It's always been you.

00:46:16.401 --> 00:46:17.521
I thought there'd
be a legal issue,

00:46:17.601 --> 00:46:21.081
but actually I'm capable
of appointing my successor.

00:46:21.801 --> 00:46:23.801
My successor being you.

00:46:25.961 --> 00:46:27.641
Congratulations?

00:46:29.321 --> 00:46:30.921
- Take it, just take it.
- I don't know what to think.

00:46:31.001 --> 00:46:32.841
Don't think. Drink.

00:46:36.521 --> 00:46:38.081
There you go.

00:46:55.388 --> 00:46:56.988
Kill him.

00:46:58.508 --> 00:47:00.548
After all I've done for you?

00:47:02.908 --> 00:47:07.548
So you're the one who
showed us the way into Asgard.

00:47:07.868 --> 00:47:10.068
That was just a
bit of fun, really.

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:14.228
To ruin my brother's big day.

00:47:15.068 --> 00:47:18.908
And to protect the realm from
his idiotic rule for a while longer.

00:47:20.228 --> 00:47:22.548
I will hear you.

00:47:25.948 --> 00:47:30.388
I will conceal you and a
handful of your soldiers,

00:47:31.068 --> 00:47:33.388
lead you into Odin's chambers,

00:47:33.468 --> 00:47:36.068
and you can slay
him where he lies.

00:47:36.548 --> 00:47:38.228
Why not kill him yourself?

00:47:40.268 --> 00:47:42.948
I suspect that the Asgardians
would not take kindly

00:47:43.068 --> 00:47:45.788
to a king who had
murdered his predecessor.

00:47:46.468 --> 00:47:49.588
Once Odin is dead, I will
return the Casket to you

00:47:51.628 --> 00:47:54.628
and you can return
Jotunheim to all its...

00:47:57.548 --> 00:47:58.908
Glory.

00:48:00.148 --> 00:48:01.468
I...

00:48:02.988 --> 00:48:04.828
Accept.

00:48:10.668 --> 00:48:12.268
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

00:48:12.508 --> 00:48:14.988
I turned my gaze
upon you in Jotunheim,

00:48:15.068 --> 00:48:17.508
but could neither
see you nor hear you.

00:48:18.148 --> 00:48:19.468
You were shrouded from me,

00:48:19.508 --> 00:48:21.668
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

00:48:21.988 --> 00:48:23.668
Perhaps your senses
have weakened

00:48:23.748 --> 00:48:25.348
after your many
years of service.

00:48:25.468 --> 00:48:27.148
Or perhaps someone
has found a way

00:48:27.148 --> 00:48:30.308
to hide that which he
does not wish me to see.

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:33.628
You have great power, Heimdall.

00:48:36.148 --> 00:48:37.628
Did Odin ever fear you?

00:48:39.868 --> 00:48:41.508
- No.
- And why is that?

00:48:41.788 --> 00:48:45.108
Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:49.348
He was your king and
you're sworn to obey me now.

00:48:50.188 --> 00:48:51.308
Yes?

00:48:56.828 --> 00:48:58.148
Yes.

00:48:58.828 --> 00:49:01.548
Then you will open
the Bifrost to no one

00:49:01.668 --> 00:49:04.508
until I have repaired the
damage that my brother has done.

00:49:12.414 --> 00:49:13.654
Jarvis!

00:49:13.734 --> 00:49:15.454
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

00:49:18.934 --> 00:49:20.957
"I am Iron Man."

00:49:21.926 --> 00:49:24.414
You think you're the only
superhero in the world?

00:49:24.774 --> 00:49:28.014
Mr. Stark, you've become
part of a bigger universe.

00:49:28.094 --> 00:49:29.894
You just don't know it yet.

00:49:30.374 --> 00:49:32.134
Who the hell are you?

00:49:32.374 --> 00:49:35.094
Nick Fury, Director
of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:49:35.934 --> 00:49:36.934
Ah.

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:40.134
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.
