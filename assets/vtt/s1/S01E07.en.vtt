WEBVTT

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:28.126
Hey, prisoner, stop!

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:30.301
What are you doing?

00:02:11.936 --> 00:02:14.363
Hey, there he is.

00:02:14.773 --> 00:02:16.308
There he is.

00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:20.193
What an absolute pleasure.

00:02:20.308 --> 00:02:21.653
Welcome.

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:23.490
Oh, goodness gracious.

00:02:23.573 --> 00:02:26.524
Can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.664
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:30.664
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

00:02:30.747 --> 00:02:31.942
I didn't want to…

00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:34.543
make a first impression like this.

00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:37.103
He's not an animal.
Come on.

00:02:37.796 --> 00:02:39.463
He's a human being.

00:02:39.547 --> 00:02:40.852
Thank you.

00:02:45.512 --> 00:02:46.738
We're fine.

00:02:48.598 --> 00:02:50.145
My name is Justin Hammer.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.020
I'd like to do some business with you.

00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:53.872
Please sit.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.586
Dig in. What do we have today, Jack?

00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:03.179
- We have some salmon carpaccio.
- Salmon carpaccio.

00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:06.617
Anything you want here, we got it.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.875
I like my dessert first.

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.643
I had this flown in from San Francisco.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.282
It's Italian, though.

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:14.406
Organic ice cream.

00:03:14.668 --> 00:03:16.068
I got a sweet tooth.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.888
Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.

00:03:20.547 --> 00:03:23.218
What I saw you do to Tony Stark
on that track…

00:03:23.301 --> 00:03:27.024
how you stepped up to him
in front of God and everybody…

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:28.448
that was…

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.015
You spoke to me with what you did.

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:33.611
And I know that you knew
that I'd be listening.

00:03:33.727 --> 00:03:36.004
This is why I couldn't bear to have
you shipped off to God knows where.

00:03:36.087 --> 00:03:38.083
It would have been such
a waste of talent.

00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:39.566
But if I might make a suggestion…

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.347
you know, you know, you don't
just go and try and kill the guy.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.430
I think…

00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:44.790
if I may…

00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:46.740
you go after his legacy.

00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:48.281
That's what you kill.

00:03:48.898 --> 00:03:51.476
You and me,
we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.

00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:54.484
The only difference between you and I…

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.966
is that I have resources.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.500
I think…

00:03:58.616 --> 00:03:59.920
if I may…

00:04:00.003 --> 00:04:02.339
you need my resources.

00:04:02.422 --> 00:04:05.002
Someone behind you, a benefactor.

00:04:05.091 --> 00:04:07.285
I'd like to be that guy.

00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:13.578
That was very fine.

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.487
Exept for one thing.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.260
I want my personal bird.

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:20.109
Ok.

00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:23.281
Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.

00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:24.225
I. I don't know.

00:04:24.308 --> 00:04:26.208
Have you been understanding
everything I'm saying?

00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:27.714
Very good, man.

00:04:27.864 --> 00:04:28.703
Very good, man.

00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:30.426
Very good, man.

00:04:31.077 --> 00:04:32.077
Hey!

00:04:33.787 --> 00:04:34.787
Hey.

00:04:35.113 --> 00:04:36.033
Yes?

00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:37.617
I want my bird.

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:40.695
A bird?

00:04:40.778 --> 00:04:43.281
- You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.058
I can get you a bird.
I can get you 10 birds.

00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:46.675
I want my bird.

00:04:46.758 --> 00:04:49.302
Well, ok.
Nothing's impossible. I could…

00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:50.778
Are we talking about…

00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:53.033
Is this a bird back in Russia?

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.015
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.

00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:32.854
You can work in absolute peace.

00:05:32.937 --> 00:05:34.708
Must be fun to be dead, right?

00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:36.022
No pressure.

00:05:36.105 --> 00:05:36.937
Here they are.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.148
I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.

00:05:39.231 --> 00:05:41.051
I may have done
a few miscalculations and…

00:05:41.134 --> 00:05:42.818
rushed the prototype into production.

00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:44.737
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.339
Go ahead, take a look around.

00:05:52.314 --> 00:05:53.829
You don't wanna do that.

00:05:53.912 --> 00:05:54.879
You'll be able…

00:05:54.962 --> 00:05:57.541
to access that as soon as we
generate some encrypted pass codes.

00:05:57.624 --> 00:05:59.710
Can we generate
some encrypted pass codes?

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:01.130
Get some of those…

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.221
encrypted pass codes, Jack.

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:05.254
Never mind, I…

00:06:07.863 --> 00:06:08.872
Ok.

00:06:09.378 --> 00:06:10.812
Good stuff.

00:06:12.764 --> 00:06:13.659
Sorry?

00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:15.433
Software shit.

00:06:17.273 --> 00:06:18.321
Well…

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:21.380
You're good.

00:06:21.773 --> 00:06:24.411
You really blasted in
past the firewall there.

00:06:26.194 --> 00:06:28.967
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:30.738
Go ahead, take a look.

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:33.062
Get a good look at that.

00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:34.620
That's something, isn't it?

00:06:34.703 --> 00:06:36.705
You know, those are really
just for show and tell.

00:06:36.788 --> 00:06:37.574
They're. They're…

00:06:37.657 --> 00:06:39.948
$125.7 million a pop, so…

00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:41.935
Wait! Oh, gosh.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:46.411
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.

00:06:47.632 --> 00:06:49.609
That's where the pilot goes.

00:06:50.302 --> 00:06:50.983
I'm having a…

00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:52.440
tough time…

00:06:52.523 --> 00:06:54.390
finding volunteers.

00:06:54.473 --> 00:06:56.402
I'll take care of that, just leave it.

00:06:57.684 --> 00:06:59.189
What you want them do?

00:06:59.272 --> 00:07:03.784
Well, long term, I want them to put me
in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

00:07:04.566 --> 00:07:06.547
I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.823
I wanna go to that Stark Expo…

00:07:07.906 --> 00:07:09.742
I wanna take a dump in Tony's front yard.

00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:11.250
You know what I'm talking about?

00:07:11.406 --> 00:07:12.356
I can do that.

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:13.575
Yeah?
No problem.

00:07:13.658 --> 00:07:15.828
Hey, hey.
Fabulous! I love it.

00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:16.775
Hey, this is our guy.

00:07:16.858 --> 00:07:18.922
Didn't I tell you?
I had. I had a feeling.

00:07:19.783 --> 00:07:23.445
That thing in your chest
is based on unfinished technology.

00:07:23.578 --> 00:07:25.173
No, it was finished, it has…

00:07:25.256 --> 00:07:28.834
never been particularly effective until
I miniaturised it and put it in my--

00:07:28.917 --> 00:07:29.439
No.

00:07:29.522 --> 00:07:31.395
Howard said the arc reactor was…

00:07:31.478 --> 00:07:32.880
the stepping stone to something greater.

00:07:32.963 --> 00:07:36.277
He was about to kick off an energy
race that was gonna dwarf…

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.767
the arms race.

00:07:37.968 --> 00:07:39.094
He was on to something big…

00:07:39.177 --> 00:07:42.557
something so big that it was gonna
make the nuclear reactor…

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.647
look like a triple-A battery.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.263
Just him, or was Anton Vanko
in on this, too?

00:07:47.346 --> 00:07:48.306
Anton Vanko…

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:50.411
is the other side of that coin.

00:07:50.494 --> 00:07:52.552
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

00:07:52.635 --> 00:07:55.069
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

00:07:55.152 --> 00:07:56.988
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver…

00:07:57.071 --> 00:07:58.661
they shipped his ass off to Siberia…

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:01.533
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

00:08:01.616 --> 00:08:04.161
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in…

00:08:04.244 --> 00:08:08.463
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

00:08:08.748 --> 00:08:10.187
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.350
What do you mean
I haven't tried everything?

00:08:11.433 --> 00:08:12.313
What haven't I tried?

00:08:12.396 --> 00:08:16.433
Well he said that you were the only
person with the means and knowledge…

00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:18.509
to finish what he started.

00:08:18.768 --> 00:08:19.874
He said that?

00:08:20.562 --> 00:08:21.817
Are you that guy?

00:08:21.984 --> 00:08:23.143
Are you?

00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:24.541
Because if you are…

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:29.043
then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

00:08:32.717 --> 00:08:35.140
I don't know where you get
your information but…

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:36.607
he wasn't my biggest fan.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.064
What do you remember
about your dad?

00:08:38.147 --> 00:08:39.947
He was cold, he was calculating.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.700
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me…

00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:44.451
so it's a little tough for me to digest…

00:08:44.534 --> 00:08:46.995
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me…

00:08:47.078 --> 00:08:49.954
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

00:08:50.123 --> 00:08:51.494
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day…

00:08:51.577 --> 00:08:52.927
was when he shipped me
off to boarding school.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.934
That's not true.

00:08:54.017 --> 00:08:56.850
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

00:08:57.297 --> 00:08:58.703
As a matter of fact, I did.

00:08:58.962 --> 00:09:00.921
He was one of the founding
embers of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:09:01.004 --> 00:09:02.144
What?

00:09:02.714 --> 00:09:04.837
- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.473
- What's this?
- Ok, you're good, right?

00:09:06.556 --> 00:09:07.915
- No, I'm not good.
- You. You. You got this, right?

00:09:07.998 --> 00:09:08.772
- Got what?
- Right?

00:09:08.855 --> 00:09:10.329
I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

00:09:10.412 --> 00:09:13.535
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

00:09:13.618 --> 00:09:15.630
And you remember
agent Coulson, right?

00:09:15.713 --> 00:09:16.838
Yeah.

00:09:17.025 --> 00:09:18.328
And Tony…

00:09:19.736 --> 00:09:20.654
remember…

00:09:20.737 --> 00:09:22.576
I got my eye on you.

00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:32.004
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

00:09:32.087 --> 00:09:33.221
Good luck.

00:09:39.971 --> 00:09:41.348
Jane, you have to leave.

00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:43.600
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm staying here.

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:45.514
Thor's going to fight with us!

00:09:45.763 --> 00:09:47.063
My friends…

00:09:47.437 --> 00:09:49.017
I'm just a man.

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:51.743
I'll only be in the way,
or worse get one of you killed.

00:09:51.868 --> 00:09:53.979
But I can help
get these people to safety.

00:09:54.062 --> 00:09:56.254
Well, if you're staying, then so am I.

00:09:56.497 --> 00:09:58.840
- We'll need some time.
- You'll have it!

00:09:59.157 --> 00:10:00.959
Ok, move it, people!

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:02.535
Everybody out!

00:10:02.618 --> 00:10:04.098
Use the back door.

00:10:04.181 --> 00:10:06.098
Go, hurry! You can eat later.

00:10:18.009 --> 00:10:19.721
Keep it distracted.

00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:37.337
For Asgard!

00:11:12.397 --> 00:11:13.698
Fall back!

00:11:30.081 --> 00:11:31.739
Go. Now. Run!

00:11:59.402 --> 00:12:02.155
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.

00:12:02.238 --> 00:12:04.658
No. I will die a warrior's death.

00:12:04.741 --> 00:12:06.869
Stories will be told of this day.

00:12:06.952 --> 00:12:10.005
Live, and tell those stories yourself.

00:12:12.224 --> 00:12:13.745
Now go.

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:23.058
You must return to Asgard.

00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:24.505
You have to stop Loki.

00:12:24.588 --> 00:12:25.929
What about you?

00:12:26.012 --> 00:12:28.425
Do not worry, my friends. I have a plan.

00:12:29.265 --> 00:12:30.400
Come on.

00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:36.851
We need to fall back. Come on.

00:12:37.273 --> 00:12:38.273
Come on.

00:12:44.407 --> 00:12:47.804
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god…

00:12:47.887 --> 00:12:49.664
and he's willing to blow up
half the world to prove it…

00:12:49.747 --> 00:12:51.390
starting with the USA.

00:12:51.473 --> 00:12:54.396
Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

00:12:54.685 --> 00:12:56.400
He gets across the Atlantic…

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.908
he will wipe out
the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

00:13:03.498 --> 00:13:04.910
How much time we got?

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.651
According to my new best friend,
under 24 hours.

00:13:07.734 --> 00:13:08.629
Where is he now?

00:13:08.712 --> 00:13:10.667
Hydra's last base is here.

00:13:11.335 --> 00:13:14.443
In the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.

00:13:16.897 --> 00:13:18.314
So what are we supposed to do?

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:21.031
I mean, it's not like
we can just knock on the front door.

00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:22.604
Why not?

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.686
That's exactly what we're going to do.

00:16:04.857 --> 00:16:08.559
<i>Everything is achievable
through technology.</i>

00:16:08.642 --> 00:16:11.114
<i>Better living, robust health…</i>

00:16:11.197 --> 00:16:17.335
<i>and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.</i>

00:16:17.537 --> 00:16:18.788
<i>I'm Howard Stark…</i>

00:16:18.871 --> 00:16:22.917
<i>and everything you'll need for the future
can be found right here.</i>

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.921
<i>City of the Future?
City of Tomorrow? City of…</i>

00:16:31.748 --> 00:16:32.969
<i>I'm Howard Stark…</i>

00:16:33.052 --> 00:16:36.452
<i>and everything you'll need in
the future can be found right here.</i>

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.911
<i>So…</i>

00:16:37.994 --> 00:16:39.934
<i>from all of us at Stark lndustries…</i>

00:16:40.017 --> 00:16:41.751
<i>I would like to personally…</i>

00:16:42.832 --> 00:16:44.113
<i>Tony, what are you doing back there?</i>

00:16:44.196 --> 00:16:45.003
<i>What is that?</i>

00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:46.142
<i>Put that back.</i>

00:16:46.225 --> 00:16:48.182
<i>Put it back where you got it from.</i>

00:16:49.068 --> 00:16:51.097
<i>Where's your mother?
Maria?</i>

00:16:51.498 --> 00:16:53.716
<i>Go on. Go, go, go, go.</i>

00:16:55.694 --> 00:16:57.473
<i>Alright, I think we got…</i>

00:16:58.411 --> 00:17:00.545
<i>I'll… I'll… I'll come in and…</i>

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.792
<i>Are you waiting on me?</i>

00:17:07.878 --> 00:17:09.886
<i>So, from all of us at Stark lndustries…</i>

00:17:09.969 --> 00:17:12.222
<i>I'd like to personally show you…</i>

00:17:13.259 --> 00:17:14.155
<i>my ass.</i>

00:17:14.238 --> 00:17:16.513
<i>I'd like to… I can't… This is…</i>

00:17:16.596 --> 00:17:18.973
<i>I can't… We have this, don't we?</i>

00:17:19.056 --> 00:17:20.956
<i>This is a ridiculous way…</i>

00:17:22.435 --> 00:17:23.573
<i>Everything…</i>

00:17:24.937 --> 00:17:26.600
<i>is achievable…</i>

00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:28.699
<i>through technology.</i>

00:17:41.407 --> 00:17:42.646
<i>Tony?</i>

00:17:42.788 --> 00:17:44.625
<i>You're too young
to understand this right now…</i>

00:17:44.708 --> 00:17:47.385
<i>so I thought
I would put it on film for you.</i>

00:17:49.511 --> 00:17:50.942
<i>I built this for you.</i>

00:17:52.347 --> 00:17:55.016
<i>And someday you'll realise
that it represents a whole lot more…</i>

00:17:55.099 --> 00:17:57.203
<i>than just people's inventions.</i>

00:17:57.381 --> 00:17:59.477
<i>It represents my life's work.</i>

00:18:00.243 --> 00:18:02.578
<i>This is the key to the future.</i>

00:18:05.603 --> 00:18:07.992
<i>I'm limited by the technology
of my time…</i>

00:18:08.466 --> 00:18:10.685
<i>but one day you'll figure this out.</i>

00:18:11.275 --> 00:18:12.587
<i>And when you do…</i>

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:15.838
<i>you will change the world.</i>

00:18:17.361 --> 00:18:19.555
<i>What is and always will be…</i>

00:18:19.928 --> 00:18:21.704
<i>my greatest creation…</i>

00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:24.930
<i>is you.</i>

00:18:46.534 --> 00:18:47.908
$6. Six.

00:18:47.991 --> 00:18:49.248
I don't have any dough.

00:18:49.331 --> 00:18:50.998
- Here.
- No, sir, that's too much.

00:18:51.081 --> 00:18:52.188
No, it's fine. Take that.

00:18:52.271 --> 00:18:54.501
- It's fine.
- No, señor.

00:18:54.584 --> 00:18:55.907
Take it. Take it.

00:18:56.362 --> 00:18:57.508
I don't like people handing me things.

00:18:57.591 --> 00:18:59.634
If you just drop that there,
that'd be great.

00:19:00.009 --> 00:19:02.145
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

00:19:02.717 --> 00:19:03.942
We believe in you.

00:19:04.886 --> 00:19:07.896
It was an illegal seizure
of trademark property.

00:19:08.014 --> 00:19:09.141
- Miss Potts?
- Relax.

00:19:09.224 --> 00:19:10.267
- Mr Stark--
- Is here.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.185
- He refuses--
- I don't. It's fine.

00:19:12.268 --> 00:19:13.107
I'll just be a second.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.784
- Listen, it's our position…
- You are excused, thank you very much.

00:19:14.867 --> 00:19:17.127
- …that Stark has and continues to maintain…
- Wendy, is it not?

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.972
…proprietary ownership
of the Mark II platform.

00:19:20.055 --> 00:19:22.800
<i>When Mr Stark announced
he was indeed Iron Man…</i>

00:19:22.883 --> 00:19:25.282
<i>- he was making a promise to America.</i>
- No, the suit belongs to us.

00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:27.159
<i>We trusted that he would look out for us.</i>

00:19:27.242 --> 00:19:29.212
- Yeah, but you're not… Burt…
<i>- He obviously did not.</i>

00:19:29.295 --> 00:19:31.136
<i>- And now we learn that his secretary…</i>
- Yes, it does.

00:19:31.219 --> 00:19:33.876
<i>…a woman named
Virginia Pepper Potts…</i>

00:19:34.249 --> 00:19:36.807
<i>has been appointed
as CEO of Stark lndustries.</i>

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.545
<i>What are her qualifications?</i>

00:19:38.628 --> 00:19:39.231
No.

00:19:39.314 --> 00:19:41.277
<i>Ms Potts is doing nothing
to manage this terrible--</i>

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.499
- Mute.
- No…

00:19:43.024 --> 00:19:45.026
Burt… Burt… Burt, listen to me.

00:19:45.109 --> 00:19:47.610
Don't tell me that we have
the best patent lawyers in the country…

00:19:47.693 --> 00:19:49.465
and then not let me pursue this.

00:19:50.114 --> 00:19:51.313
- I'll get this stuff out of here.
- Well then…

00:19:51.396 --> 00:19:53.295
…tell the President to sign an order.

00:19:54.863 --> 00:19:56.326
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

00:19:56.409 --> 00:19:59.328
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.717
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

00:20:03.044 --> 00:20:04.583
- No, he will not.
- I would like to be.

00:20:04.666 --> 00:20:05.666
Bye.

00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:07.502
- Got a minute?
- No.

00:20:07.585 --> 00:20:10.277
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.

00:20:11.834 --> 00:20:14.222
- Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.
- I, um…

00:20:14.305 --> 00:20:15.802
I was just driving over here…

00:20:15.885 --> 00:20:18.560
and I thought I was coming
to basically apologise, but I'm not.

00:20:18.643 --> 00:20:20.124
You didn't come here to apologise?

00:20:20.207 --> 00:20:22.721
Look, that goes without saying,
and I'm working on that.

00:20:23.147 --> 00:20:25.255
But I haven't been entirely up…

00:20:25.338 --> 00:20:26.338
upfront…

00:20:26.852 --> 00:20:28.326
with you and I just want
to try to make good.

00:20:28.409 --> 00:20:29.301
Can I move this?

00:20:29.384 --> 00:20:30.712
This is crazy.

00:20:30.795 --> 00:20:31.883
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

00:20:31.966 --> 00:20:33.546
- I'm trying to get some--
- No.

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:37.846
Do you know how short life is?

00:20:38.329 --> 00:20:40.410
And if I never got to…

00:20:40.493 --> 00:20:41.436
express…

00:20:41.519 --> 00:20:42.684
and by the way this is…

00:20:42.767 --> 00:20:44.252
somewhat revelatory to me.

00:20:44.335 --> 00:20:45.152
And I don't care…

00:20:45.235 --> 00:20:46.755
I mean, I care. It would be nice.

00:20:46.838 --> 00:20:48.424
I'm not expecting you to, to…

00:20:48.507 --> 00:20:49.640
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

00:20:49.723 --> 00:20:51.696
- I'm just gonna say it.
- Let me stop you right here, ok?

00:20:51.779 --> 00:20:54.262
Because if you say I, one more time…

00:20:54.345 --> 00:20:57.438
I'm gonna actually hurl something
at your head, I think.

00:20:57.682 --> 00:20:59.601
I am trying to run a company.

00:20:59.684 --> 00:21:01.421
Do you have any idea what that entails?

00:21:01.504 --> 00:21:02.270
Yes.

00:21:02.353 --> 00:21:05.274
People are relying on you to be Iron Man
and you've disappeared…

00:21:05.357 --> 00:21:08.825
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires
and taking the heat for it.

00:21:11.362 --> 00:21:15.165
I am trying to do the job
that you were meant to do.

00:21:18.532 --> 00:21:20.396
Did you bring me strawberries?

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:24.431
Did you know that there is
only one thing on Earth…

00:21:24.949 --> 00:21:27.215
- …that I'm allergic to?
- Allergic to strawberries.

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:31.290
This is progress, Pepper.

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:33.877
I knew there was a correlation
between you and this.

00:21:35.089 --> 00:21:36.328
- I need you…
- I need you, too.

00:21:36.411 --> 00:21:39.380
- …to leave now.
- That's what I'm trying to--

00:21:44.202 --> 00:21:45.442
Ms Potts?

00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:47.855
Hi, come on in.

00:21:47.938 --> 00:21:50.046
Wheels up in 25 minutes.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.341
Thank you.

00:21:53.252 --> 00:21:54.155
Anything else, boss?

00:21:54.238 --> 00:21:55.981
- I'm good, Hap.
- No, I'll be just…

00:21:56.659 --> 00:21:58.141
…another minute.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.835
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

00:22:02.262 --> 00:22:03.288
That's a…

00:22:04.876 --> 00:22:05.903
No.

00:22:08.114 --> 00:22:10.866
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?

00:22:10.949 --> 00:22:12.267
Here at Stark…

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.732
Enterprises?

00:22:14.315 --> 00:22:15.887
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

00:22:16.682 --> 00:22:18.366
I thought you two didn't…

00:22:19.261 --> 00:22:20.614
- …get along.
- No. That's not so.

00:22:20.697 --> 00:22:22.417
It's just me you don't care for.

00:22:23.267 --> 00:22:24.299
No? Nothing?

00:22:24.382 --> 00:22:25.687
Actually, while you're here…

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.774
maybe you and Natalie could discuss
the matter of the personal belongings.

00:22:28.857 --> 00:22:30.133
Absolutely.

00:22:36.864 --> 00:22:37.920
I'm surprised you can keep
your mouth shut.

00:22:38.003 --> 00:22:38.853
Boy, you're good.

00:22:38.936 --> 00:22:41.687
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.643
You just tear things…
You're a triple impostor.

00:22:43.726 --> 00:22:45.986
I've never seen anything like you.
Is there anything real about you?

00:22:46.069 --> 00:22:46.912
Do you even speak Latin?

00:22:46.995 --> 00:22:48.869
Fallaces sunt rerum species.

00:22:49.293 --> 00:22:51.005
Which means? Wait. What?

00:22:51.088 --> 00:22:51.915
What did you just say?

00:22:51.998 --> 00:22:54.754
It means you can either drive yourself
home or I can have you collected.

00:22:56.829 --> 00:22:58.053
You're good.

00:23:54.845 --> 00:23:57.874
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

00:23:58.257 --> 00:23:59.790
Candygram.

00:24:04.062 --> 00:24:05.539
I brought you something.

00:24:06.106 --> 00:24:08.018
Oh, yeah.

00:24:10.402 --> 00:24:12.136
We got you the bird, pal.

00:24:12.219 --> 00:24:13.707
This is not my bird.

00:24:14.072 --> 00:24:16.080
What do you mean?
That's the bird. This is the bird.

00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:18.985
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

00:24:19.068 --> 00:24:20.412
This is a great bird.

00:24:20.495 --> 00:24:23.124
- It's a beautiful bird.
- We got this all the way from Russia.

00:24:23.207 --> 00:24:25.966
Hey man, this not my bird.

00:24:28.003 --> 00:24:31.924
Well listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

00:24:32.007 --> 00:24:34.723
I mean, you know, look,
don't get so attached to things.

00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:36.529
Learn to let go.

00:24:39.348 --> 00:24:40.514
Wait a minute.

00:24:40.597 --> 00:24:42.245
Jack, what is that?

00:24:42.392 --> 00:24:45.819
Is that… That's not a helmet.
What is that?

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:55.369
Ivan…

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:57.874
What's this? Jack.

00:24:58.533 --> 00:24:59.301
Is that a helmet?

00:24:59.384 --> 00:25:00.578
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

00:25:00.661 --> 00:25:03.247
How. How… How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.811
Jack, could you, could you
put your head in there?

00:25:04.894 --> 00:25:05.166
No.

00:25:05.249 --> 00:25:06.453
Put. Try to put your head in there.
Is not…

00:25:06.536 --> 00:25:08.405
Now go ahead.
Put your head in there.

00:25:08.543 --> 00:25:10.999
See Ivan, he can't put
his head in there. That's…

00:25:11.296 --> 00:25:11.914
That's…

00:25:11.997 --> 00:25:14.096
That's not a helmet. It's a head.

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:15.676
I need to put a guy in there.

00:25:15.759 --> 00:25:17.941
I need to fit a person in that,
in that suit.

00:25:18.024 --> 00:25:19.388
You understand?

00:25:19.471 --> 00:25:20.386
Drone better.

00:25:20.469 --> 00:25:21.599
What? Drone better?

00:25:21.682 --> 00:25:22.810
Why is drone better?

00:25:22.893 --> 00:25:24.198
Why is drone better?

00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:25.949
People make problem.

00:25:26.228 --> 00:25:26.978
Trust me.

00:25:27.061 --> 00:25:28.405
Drone better.

00:25:28.492 --> 00:25:29.468
Ivan…

00:25:29.551 --> 00:25:32.581
you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:33.527
I'm…

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.446
You said, no problem.

00:25:35.529 --> 00:25:38.347
That's what you said to me.
You said, No problem.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.327
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.412
Like Iron Man. You understand?

00:25:43.495 --> 00:25:44.958
That's what the people want.

00:25:45.041 --> 00:25:46.985
That's what's gonna make them happy.

00:25:47.457 --> 00:25:48.711
Hey, man.

00:25:50.288 --> 00:25:52.615
Don't get too attached to things.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.272
Learn to let go.

00:25:58.427 --> 00:26:01.729
These drones better steal
the show, Ivan.

00:26:02.055 --> 00:26:03.280
You understand?

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.898
Better rock my world, Ivan.

00:26:15.275 --> 00:26:17.243
Unbelievable.

00:26:17.402 --> 00:26:20.005
This ought to get
the Senate off my ass.

00:26:20.155 --> 00:26:21.548
It's functional?

00:26:21.881 --> 00:26:23.586
Fully mission-capable.

00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:24.752
Good.

00:26:24.835 --> 00:26:26.970
Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

00:26:28.288 --> 00:26:29.010
Sir?

00:26:29.093 --> 00:26:32.002
Justin Hammer's making
a weapons presentation at the Expo.

00:26:32.085 --> 00:26:33.752
We'd like this to introduce it.

00:26:33.835 --> 00:26:35.338
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo…

00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:38.299
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

00:26:38.382 --> 00:26:40.001
We've got to make this happen.

00:26:40.084 --> 00:26:41.345
Yes, General, but it's…

00:26:41.428 --> 00:26:43.729
It's also an order.

00:26:43.887 --> 00:26:45.229
Yes, sir.

00:26:45.597 --> 00:26:46.693
Good work, Colonel.

00:26:46.776 --> 00:26:48.606
You've made your country proud.

00:26:49.142 --> 00:26:50.483
Thank you, sir.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.182
What's he doing?

00:27:30.697 --> 00:27:32.267
Brother, whatever…

00:27:32.405 --> 00:27:34.497
I have done to wrong you…

00:27:34.742 --> 00:27:37.553
whatever I have done
to lead you to do this…

00:27:38.235 --> 00:27:40.268
I am truly sorry.

00:27:40.521 --> 00:27:42.760
<i>But these people are innocent.</i>

00:27:44.252 --> 00:27:45.794
Taking their lives…

00:27:45.877 --> 00:27:47.794
will gain you nothing.

00:27:55.096 --> 00:27:56.533
So take mine…

00:27:57.348 --> 00:27:58.772
and end this.

00:28:12.697 --> 00:28:13.771
No.

00:28:29.797 --> 00:28:31.335
It's over.

00:28:31.466 --> 00:28:33.901
No. it's not over.

00:28:34.385 --> 00:28:36.555
I mean, you're safe.

00:28:36.638 --> 00:28:37.946
We're safe.

00:28:38.806 --> 00:28:40.449
It's over.

00:28:46.147 --> 00:28:47.451
No.

00:29:05.792 --> 00:29:07.093
No.

00:29:32.735 --> 00:29:35.113
We're spiking.
Levels increase!

00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:37.169
Whosoever holds this hammer…

00:29:39.487 --> 00:29:40.944
if he be worthy…

00:29:43.788 --> 00:29:45.886
shall possess the power of Thor.

00:30:01.472 --> 00:30:02.615
Jane!

00:30:04.976 --> 00:30:07.349
No. No. No!
Come!

00:30:07.432 --> 00:30:08.432
No!

00:30:28.875 --> 00:30:32.415
Oh. My. God.

00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:43.916
So, is this how you normally look?

00:31:44.158 --> 00:31:45.566
More or less.

00:31:46.077 --> 00:31:48.050
It's a good look.

00:31:48.246 --> 00:31:50.024
We must go to the Bifrost site.

00:31:50.107 --> 00:31:51.440
I would have words with my brother.

00:31:51.523 --> 00:31:52.673
Excuse me!

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.664
Donald?

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.418
I don't think you've been
completely honest with me.

00:32:00.501 --> 00:32:01.760
Know this, Son of Coul.

00:32:01.843 --> 00:32:03.468
You and I, we fight for the same cause…

00:32:03.551 --> 00:32:04.846
the protection of this world.

00:32:04.929 --> 00:32:07.105
From this day forward,
you can count me as your ally…

00:32:07.188 --> 00:32:10.023
if you return the items
you have taken from Jane.

00:32:10.106 --> 00:32:11.771
- Stolen.
- Borrowed.

00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:14.763
Of course, you can have
your equipment back.

00:32:14.897 --> 00:32:17.140
You're gonna need it
to continue your research.

00:32:17.812 --> 00:32:19.859
Would you like to see
the bridge we spoke of?

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.320
Sure.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.331
Wait, I need to debrief you!

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.945
Arrogance may not be
a uniquely American trait…

00:32:41.028 --> 00:32:43.724
but I must say,
you do it better than anyone.

00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:48.817
But there are limits…

00:32:49.192 --> 00:32:51.456
to what even you can do, Captain.

00:32:51.662 --> 00:32:55.192
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

00:32:55.416 --> 00:32:57.254
He told me you were insane.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.316
He resented my genius…

00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:07.046
and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine.

00:33:07.129 --> 00:33:09.255
But he gave you everything.

00:33:10.914 --> 00:33:12.264
So…

00:33:14.286 --> 00:33:16.810
what made you so special?

00:33:19.973 --> 00:33:21.212
Nothing.

00:33:22.449 --> 00:33:24.130
I am just a kid from Brooklyn.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.842
I can do this all day.

00:33:36.925 --> 00:33:39.059
Of course you can, of course.

00:33:39.142 --> 00:33:42.508
But, unfortunately,
I am on a tight schedule.

00:33:48.324 --> 00:33:49.698
So am I.

00:34:01.765 --> 00:34:02.765
Rogers.

00:34:03.696 --> 00:34:05.018
You might need this.

00:34:05.391 --> 00:34:06.479
Thanks.

00:34:17.279 --> 00:34:20.021
We're in.
Assault team, go.

00:34:20.104 --> 00:34:21.222
Move out.

00:34:22.052 --> 00:34:23.865
Move.

00:34:30.017 --> 00:34:31.693
Keep your spacing.

00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:13.795
Cut off one head, two more shall…

00:35:15.381 --> 00:35:17.137
Let's go find two more.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.067
You're late.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.192
- Weren't you about to…
- Right.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.238
Get in.

00:37:33.777 --> 00:37:35.625
- Keep it steady.
- Wait.

00:37:40.751 --> 00:37:42.245
Go get him.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:45.781
I am not kissing you.

00:38:34.869 --> 00:38:36.441
Think this is the power source?

00:38:36.524 --> 00:38:41.619
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, alright?

00:38:42.501 --> 00:38:43.525
Yes, sir.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.628
Oh, yes!

00:38:45.908 --> 00:38:47.882
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:38:47.965 --> 00:38:49.538
Is it my birthday?

00:38:49.884 --> 00:38:51.995
You got it. What did you do?

00:38:52.115 --> 00:38:53.752
What did you do?

00:38:56.479 --> 00:38:57.922
Is this what I think it is?

00:38:58.005 --> 00:38:59.382
Yes, it is.

00:38:59.477 --> 00:39:00.477
Hammer…

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.545
I want to know what
you're gonna do for us.

00:39:02.628 --> 00:39:04.259
What am I going to do for you?

00:39:04.384 --> 00:39:07.305
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you
is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

00:39:07.388 --> 00:39:09.841
- And then second I think I should--
- That's not what I'm talking about. Hammer…

00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:12.105
I'm talking about firepower.

00:39:14.367 --> 00:39:15.967
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

00:39:17.745 --> 00:39:21.339
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

00:39:22.333 --> 00:39:23.566
Too downtown?

00:39:23.673 --> 00:39:24.912
I agree.

00:39:25.211 --> 00:39:27.762
M24 shotgun, pump action.

00:39:28.089 --> 00:39:29.382
Five-round magazine.

00:39:29.465 --> 00:39:31.028
You know what?
You're not a hunter.

00:39:31.111 --> 00:39:32.969
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

00:39:33.052 --> 00:39:35.459
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

00:39:35.542 --> 00:39:37.763
They do make something
better than waffles.

00:39:38.724 --> 00:39:40.919
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you…

00:39:41.002 --> 00:39:42.191
so I'm gonna put it right here.

00:39:42.274 --> 00:39:45.264
You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

00:39:45.454 --> 00:39:47.164
Tear gas, smoke.

00:39:47.269 --> 00:39:48.651
Hippie control.

00:39:48.734 --> 00:39:50.006
You're tough.

00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:52.584
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

00:39:52.667 --> 00:39:54.440
Don't let anyone tell you different.

00:39:54.523 --> 00:39:57.952
This is an M1347.62 Minigun.

00:39:58.035 --> 00:39:59.373
Six individual barrels.

00:39:59.456 --> 00:40:01.497
The torso taker, powder maker.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.662
Our boys in uniform call it
Uncle Gazpacho…

00:40:03.745 --> 00:40:05.752
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

00:40:09.171 --> 00:40:10.171
Ok.

00:40:12.174 --> 00:40:16.190
These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

00:40:17.638 --> 00:40:19.557
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle…

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.925
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.284
It's capable of busting the bunker…

00:40:26.367 --> 00:40:28.024
under the bunker you just busted.

00:40:28.107 --> 00:40:30.276
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

00:40:30.359 --> 00:40:33.271
A book that would make Ulysses
look like it was written in crayon.

00:40:34.215 --> 00:40:35.765
It would read it to you.

00:40:36.203 --> 00:40:37.784
This is my Eiffel Tower.

00:40:37.867 --> 00:40:39.686
This is my Rachmaninoff's Third.

00:40:39.769 --> 00:40:40.953
My Pietà.

00:40:41.036 --> 00:40:44.059
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

00:40:44.151 --> 00:40:48.629
And it's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

00:40:50.004 --> 00:40:51.847
I call it the Ex-Wife.

00:40:56.997 --> 00:40:58.662
That's the best I got.

00:41:04.059 --> 00:41:05.760
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

00:41:05.843 --> 00:41:08.276
You're like a sphinx.
I can't read you.

00:41:08.594 --> 00:41:09.864
I think I'll take it.

00:41:09.947 --> 00:41:10.998
Which one?

00:41:11.567 --> 00:41:12.828
All of it.

00:41:14.507 --> 00:41:15.849
All of it.

00:41:17.253 --> 00:41:19.965
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form
a digital wire frame?

00:41:20.048 --> 00:41:22.197
I need a manipulatable projection.

00:41:29.849 --> 00:41:33.560
<i>1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.</i>

00:41:35.558 --> 00:41:37.435
How many buildings are there?

00:41:37.518 --> 00:41:39.985
<i>Am I to include
the Belgian waffle stands?</i>

00:41:40.068 --> 00:41:42.330
That was rhetorical. Just show me.

00:41:55.416 --> 00:41:57.019
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?

00:41:57.754 --> 00:42:00.005
Not unlike an atom.

00:42:00.088 --> 00:42:01.755
In which case the nucleus…

00:42:02.482 --> 00:42:04.024
would be here.

00:42:04.634 --> 00:42:06.172
Highlight the unisphere.

00:42:15.561 --> 00:42:17.112
Lose the footpaths.

00:42:17.524 --> 00:42:18.460
Get rid of them.

00:42:18.543 --> 00:42:20.567
<i>What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?</i>

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:21.836
I'm discovering…

00:42:21.919 --> 00:42:22.527
Correction.

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.202
I'm rediscovering…

00:42:24.885 --> 00:42:26.872
a new element, I believe.

00:42:27.323 --> 00:42:29.891
Lose the landscaping,
the shrubbery, the trees.

00:42:30.396 --> 00:42:32.645
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

00:42:37.583 --> 00:42:39.701
Structure the protons
and the neutrons…

00:42:40.051 --> 00:42:41.763
using the pavilions…

00:42:42.254 --> 00:42:43.750
as a framework.

00:42:46.634 --> 00:42:48.101
Dad.

00:43:09.032 --> 00:43:10.897
Dead for almost 20 years…

00:43:11.849 --> 00:43:14.064
and still taking me to school.

00:43:20.001 --> 00:43:24.411
<i>The proposed element should serve
as a viable replacement for palladium.</i>

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.799
Thanks, Dad.

00:43:25.882 --> 00:43:29.166
<i>Unfortunately, it is impossible
to synthesise.</i>

00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:37.201
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas.
We're back in hardware mode.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.784
<i>Initialising prismatic accelerator.</i>

00:44:32.976 --> 00:44:35.417
<i>Approaching maximum power.</i>

00:45:22.901 --> 00:45:24.215
That was easy.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:42.625
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.496
<i>You have created a new element.</i>

00:45:54.849 --> 00:45:58.314
<i>Sir, the reactor has accepted
the modified core.</i>

00:45:58.728 --> 00:46:00.937
<i>I will begin running diagnostics.</i>

00:46:07.134 --> 00:46:08.435
Hey, Ivan.

00:46:08.863 --> 00:46:10.490
<i>I got Senator Stern here.</i>

00:46:10.573 --> 00:46:12.951
<i>Thought we'd swing over
and look at some of the drone designs.</i>

00:46:13.034 --> 00:46:15.495
The drone is not going to be ready.

00:46:15.578 --> 00:46:16.980
Not ready? What do you mean?

00:46:17.235 --> 00:46:20.333
I can make presentation,
not demonstration.

00:46:20.416 --> 00:46:22.706
What the hell is the difference?

00:46:22.789 --> 00:46:25.505
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

00:46:25.588 --> 00:46:27.317
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

00:46:27.548 --> 00:46:28.695
What can you make them do?

00:46:28.778 --> 00:46:30.677
I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.297
I can make salute.

00:46:32.904 --> 00:46:33.997
<i>You can make salute?</i>

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.413
What do you mean, make salute?

00:46:35.496 --> 00:46:37.535
<i>What the hell does that mean, Ivan?</i>

00:46:37.618 --> 00:46:39.686
<i>This is not what we agreed to, ok?</i>

00:46:39.769 --> 00:46:42.397
<i>You promised me suits
and then you promised me drones.</i>

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.151
Hey, man, everything will be ok.

00:46:45.234 --> 00:46:46.932
<i>This is not what I wanted.</i>

00:49:50.723 --> 00:49:53.109
You don't give up, do you?

00:49:53.193 --> 00:49:54.242
Nope.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:05.491
You could have the power of the gods.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:10.892
Yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations.

00:51:11.603 --> 00:51:14.122
I have seen the future, Captain.

00:51:14.447 --> 00:51:16.225
There are no flags.

00:51:16.308 --> 00:51:17.906
Not my future.

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:33.027
What have you done?

00:51:33.375 --> 00:51:34.642
No.

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.238
<i>Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?</i>

00:52:45.321 --> 00:52:47.026
- Captain Rogers, what is your--
- Steve, is that you?

00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.844
Are you alright?

00:52:47.927 --> 00:52:49.705
<i>Peggy, Schmidt's dead.</i>

00:52:50.091 --> 00:52:51.519
<i>What about the plane?</i>

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:55.269
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

00:52:55.352 --> 00:52:58.218
Give me your coordinates.
I will find you a safe landing site.

00:52:59.212 --> 00:53:01.162
There's not going to be a safe landing.

00:53:01.389 --> 00:53:02.965
<i>But I can try and force it down.</i>

00:53:03.048 --> 00:53:05.120
Ok I will get Howard on the line.
He will know what to do.

00:53:05.203 --> 00:53:06.285
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

00:53:06.368 --> 00:53:09.173
<i>This thing's moving too fast
and it's heading for New York.</i>

00:53:13.673 --> 00:53:15.417
I got to put her in the water.

00:53:15.678 --> 00:53:18.789
Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.

00:53:18.872 --> 00:53:20.057
Right now I am in
the middle of nowhere.

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.517
If I wait any longer,
a lot of people are going to die.

00:53:27.768 --> 00:53:29.089
Peggy…

00:53:31.137 --> 00:53:32.372
this is my choice.

00:53:56.297 --> 00:53:57.606
Peggy?

00:53:58.376 --> 00:53:59.595
<i>I'm here.</i>

00:54:02.634 --> 00:54:05.010
I am going to need a rain check
on that dance.

00:54:13.557 --> 00:54:14.757
Alright.

00:54:17.998 --> 00:54:20.587
A week, next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.

00:54:21.909 --> 00:54:23.080
You got it.

00:54:24.993 --> 00:54:27.932
<i>8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late.</i>

00:54:28.385 --> 00:54:29.580
<i>Understood?</i>

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:33.395
You know, I still don't know how to dance.

00:54:39.566 --> 00:54:41.112
I will show you how.

00:54:41.415 --> 00:54:42.830
Just be there.

00:54:43.809 --> 00:54:45.973
We will have the band
play something slow.

00:54:49.416 --> 00:54:51.053
<i>I'd hate to step on your--</i>

00:54:54.021 --> 00:54:55.168
Steve?

00:54:57.883 --> 00:54:59.013
Steve?

00:55:02.406 --> 00:55:03.621
Steve?

00:56:02.456 --> 00:56:04.016
To the Captain.

00:56:16.329 --> 00:56:17.329
Sir?

00:56:27.631 --> 00:56:29.474
Take us to the next grid point.

00:56:29.724 --> 00:56:31.646
But there is no trace of wreckage.

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.830
And the energy signature stops here.

00:56:36.056 --> 00:56:37.877
Just keep looking.
