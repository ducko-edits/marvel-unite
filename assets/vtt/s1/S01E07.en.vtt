WEBVTT

00:02:13.363 --> 00:02:16.843
Hey, there he is. There he is.

00:02:19.563 --> 00:02:22.723
What an absolute pleasure.
Welcome.

00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:27.523
Oh, goodness gracious. Can we
get the handcuffs off my friend here?

00:02:28.563 --> 00:02:32.083
Forgive me, I'm sorry.
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

00:02:32.163 --> 00:02:35.963
I didn't want to make a
first impression like this.

00:02:36.043 --> 00:02:38.283
He's not an animal. Come on.

00:02:39.203 --> 00:02:41.883
He's a human being. Thank you.

00:02:45.523 --> 00:02:46.843
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

00:02:46.923 --> 00:02:48.323
We're fine.

00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:51.683
My name is Justin Hammer.

00:02:51.763 --> 00:02:55.083
I'd like to do some
business with you. Please sit.

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:01.323
Dig in.
What do we have today, Jack?

00:03:01.403 --> 00:03:02.683
We have some salmon carpaccio.

00:03:02.763 --> 00:03:04.723
Salmon carpaccio.

00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:08.043
Mmm-mmm.
Anything you want here, we got it.

00:03:08.123 --> 00:03:12.203
I like my dessert first.
I had this flown in from San Francisco.

00:03:12.283 --> 00:03:14.163
It's Italian, though.

00:03:14.243 --> 00:03:16.043
Organic ice cream.

00:03:16.123 --> 00:03:20.043
I got a sweet tooth. Apparently
you do, too, for Tony Stark.

00:03:21.963 --> 00:03:24.763
What I saw you do to
Tony Stark on that track,

00:03:24.843 --> 00:03:28.523
how you stepped up to him
in front of God and everybody,

00:03:28.603 --> 00:03:30.723
that was... Wow!

00:03:30.803 --> 00:03:32.363
You spoke to me
with what you did.

00:03:32.443 --> 00:03:34.923
And I know that you
knew that I'd be listening.

00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:37.403
This is why I couldn't bear to have
you shipped off to God knows where.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.563
It would have been
such a waste of talent.

00:03:39.643 --> 00:03:40.963
But if I might
make a suggestion,

00:03:41.043 --> 00:03:43.763
you know, you don't just
go and try and kill the guy.

00:03:43.843 --> 00:03:49.283
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.
That's what you kill.

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:53.363
You and me, we are a
lot alike in a lot of ways.

00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:58.083
The only difference between
you and I is that I have resources.

00:03:58.923 --> 00:04:01.323
I think, if I may,

00:04:01.403 --> 00:04:06.403
you need my resources.
Someone behind you, a benefactor.

00:04:06.483 --> 00:04:08.563
I'd like to be that guy.

00:04:20.483 --> 00:04:22.563
Okay. Do you speak English?

00:04:22.643 --> 00:04:24.763
Because I can get a translator.

00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:27.683
I don't know. Have you been
understanding everything I'm saying?

00:04:27.763 --> 00:04:29.203
Very good, man.

00:04:29.283 --> 00:04:30.603
Very good, man.

00:04:30.683 --> 00:04:32.443
Very good, man.

00:04:32.523 --> 00:04:34.203
Hey! Huh?

00:04:35.203 --> 00:04:36.283
Hey.

00:04:36.363 --> 00:04:37.363
Yes?

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:39.043
I want my bird.

00:04:41.043 --> 00:04:43.043
A bird? You want a bird?

00:04:43.123 --> 00:04:44.723
I want my bird.

00:04:44.803 --> 00:04:46.043
I can get you a bird.
I can get you 10 birds.

00:04:46.123 --> 00:04:48.083
I want my bird.

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.723
Well, okay.
Nothing's impossible. I could...

00:04:50.803 --> 00:04:54.483
Are we talking about...
Is this a bird back in Russia?

00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:39.771
Remember when I made you
ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?

00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:41.531
Yeah, and I threw up?

00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:44.331
This isn't payback, is it?

00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:46.171
Now why would I do that?

00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:49.011
We were right.
Dr. Zola's on the train.

00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:52.611
Hydra dispatcher gave him
permission to open up the throttle.

00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:54.611
Wherever he's going,
they must need him bad.

00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:04.091
Let's get going, because
they're moving like the devil.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.451
We only got about
a 10-second window.

00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:09.091
You miss that window,
we're bugs on a windshield.

00:06:09.731 --> 00:06:10.731
Mind the gap.

00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:12.691
Better get moving, bugs!

00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:22.611
Stop him! Fire again!

00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:17.811
- I had him on the ropes.
- I know you did.

00:08:18.451 --> 00:08:19.531
Get down!

00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:23.051
Fire again!

00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:25.371
<i>Kill him! Now!</i>

00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:33.611
Bucky!

00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:39.171
Hang on!

00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:41.891
Grab my hand!

00:08:42.691 --> 00:08:43.731
No!

00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:48.771
Sit down.

00:09:55.211 --> 00:09:57.531
- What is this?
- Steak.

00:09:58.451 --> 00:09:59.611
What is in it?

00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:02.051
Cow.

00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:08.131
Doctor, do you
realize how difficult it is

00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:11.051
to get ahold of a prime
cut like that out here?

00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:13.891
I don't eat meat.

00:10:14.811 --> 00:10:15.971
Why not?

00:10:16.011 --> 00:10:17.731
It disagrees with me.

00:10:17.811 --> 00:10:20.771
How about cyanide? Does that
give you the rumbly tummy, too?

00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:26.811
Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive

00:10:26.891 --> 00:10:31.731
has crunched a little pill before
we can stop him. But not you.

00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:35.571
So, here is my brilliant theory.

00:10:37.811 --> 00:10:39.171
You want to live.

00:10:40.491 --> 00:10:42.651
You're trying to
intimidate me, Colonel.

00:10:43.251 --> 00:10:44.891
I bought you dinner.

00:10:50.091 --> 00:10:53.171
"Given the valuable
information he has provided

00:10:53.931 --> 00:10:57.531
"and in exchange for
his full cooperation,

00:10:57.931 --> 00:11:00.851
"Dr. Zola is being
remanded to Switzerland"?

00:11:00.891 --> 00:11:03.651
I sent that message to
Washington this morning.

00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:04.891
Of course, it was encoded.

00:11:05.571 --> 00:11:09.171
You guys haven't broken those codes,
have you? That would be awkward.

00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:11.291
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:14.931
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.

00:11:15.371 --> 00:11:17.371
You know more about
Schmidt than anyone.

00:11:17.691 --> 00:11:22.851
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

00:11:22.931 --> 00:11:25.891
so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.

00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:29.291
It's you or Schmidt.

00:11:29.891 --> 00:11:31.971
It's just the hand
you've been dealt.

00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:37.691
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

00:11:38.251 --> 00:11:39.251
Hmm.

00:11:39.371 --> 00:11:42.211
Only the world
itself will satisfy him.

00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:44.531
You do realize
that's nuts, don't you?

00:11:44.571 --> 00:11:45.571
What?

00:11:46.571 --> 00:11:48.811
The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.

00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:51.051
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it!

00:11:51.731 --> 00:11:53.091
What's his target?

00:11:54.331 --> 00:11:56.691
His target

00:11:58.251 --> 00:11:59.331
is everywhere.

00:12:11.912 --> 00:12:14.232
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.

00:12:14.312 --> 00:12:16.112
You can work in absolute peace.

00:12:16.192 --> 00:12:17.752
Must be fun to be dead, right?

00:12:17.872 --> 00:12:19.272
No pressure.

00:12:19.352 --> 00:12:22.352
Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.

00:12:22.432 --> 00:12:23.912
I may have done a
few miscalculations

00:12:23.992 --> 00:12:25.992
and rushed the
prototype into production.

00:12:26.072 --> 00:12:27.952
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

00:12:28.032 --> 00:12:29.672
Go ahead, take a look around.

00:12:35.112 --> 00:12:37.032
Oh, you don't wanna do that.

00:12:37.112 --> 00:12:38.752
You'll be able to access that

00:12:38.832 --> 00:12:40.752
as soon as we generate
some encrypted pass codes.

00:12:40.832 --> 00:12:42.912
Can we generate some
encrypted pass codes?

00:12:42.992 --> 00:12:46.152
Get some of those
encrypted pass codes, Jack.

00:12:47.312 --> 00:12:48.952
Never mind, I...

00:12:50.232 --> 00:12:53.512
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

00:12:55.992 --> 00:12:57.112
Sorry?

00:12:57.232 --> 00:12:58.312
Software shit.

00:12:58.392 --> 00:12:59.432
Uh-huh?

00:13:00.552 --> 00:13:02.392
Well...

00:13:03.272 --> 00:13:08.152
You're good. You really blasted
in past the firewall there. Uh...

00:13:09.392 --> 00:13:12.272
Let me show you where you're
gonna be working primarily.

00:13:12.352 --> 00:13:14.272
Go ahead, take a look.

00:13:15.192 --> 00:13:17.832
Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

00:13:17.912 --> 00:13:19.912
You know, those are
really just for show and tell.

00:13:19.992 --> 00:13:25.832
They're $125.7 million a pop, so...
Wait! Oh, gosh. Uh...

00:13:27.112 --> 00:13:29.352
Jesus Christ.
Get somebody up here.

00:13:30.472 --> 00:13:33.072
Um, that's where the pilot goes.

00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:37.552
I'm having a tough
time finding volunteers.

00:13:37.632 --> 00:13:39.192
I'll take care of that,
just leave it.

00:13:40.912 --> 00:13:42.392
What you want them do?

00:13:42.472 --> 00:13:44.192
Well, long term,
I want them to put me

00:13:44.272 --> 00:13:47.712
in the Pentagon for
the next 25 years.

00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:49.832
I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:51.032
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,

00:13:51.112 --> 00:13:53.032
I wanna take a dump
in Tony's front yard.

00:13:53.112 --> 00:13:54.312
You know what I'm talking about?

00:13:54.392 --> 00:13:55.592
I can do that. No problem.

00:13:55.672 --> 00:13:56.792
Yeah?

00:13:56.872 --> 00:13:59.032
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

00:13:59.112 --> 00:14:01.832
Hey, this is our guy.
Didn't I tell you? I had a feeling.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.710
That thing in your chest is
based on unfinished technology.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.750
No, it was finished.
It has never been particularly effective

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.030
until I miniaturized it
and put it in my...

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.230
No. Howard said the arc reactor

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.070
was the stepping stone
to something greater.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.670
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.910
He was on to something big,
something so big

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.870
that it was gonna
make the nuclear reactor

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.910
look like a triple-A battery.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.550
Just him, or was Anton
Vanko in on this, too?

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.710
Anton Vanko is the
other side of that coin.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.830
Anton saw it as
a way to get rich.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.270
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.270
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.910
they shipped his ass
off to Siberia

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.710
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.390
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.590
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.270
You told me I hadn't
tried everything.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.590
What do you mean I haven't tried
everything? What haven't I tried?

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.950
He said that you were the only
person with the means and knowledge

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.070
to finish what he started.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.670
- He said that?
- Mmm.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.430
Are you that guy? Hmm? Are you?

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:11.830
'Cause if you are, then you
can solve the riddle of your heart.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.590
I don't know where
you get your information,

00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:19.610
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.390
What do you remember
about your dad?

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.150
He was cold,
he was calculating.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.270
He never told me he loved me.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:25.990
He never even
told me he liked me,

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.630
so it's a little tough
for me to digest

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.230
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.270
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.630
You're talking about a
guy whose happiest day

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.150
was when he shipped
me off to boarding school.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.310
That's not true.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.070
Well, then, clearly you knew
my dad better than I did.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.150
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one
of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.430
What?

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:46.950
I got a 2:00.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.070
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.670
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.510
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.470
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.790
Natasha will remain a floater
at Stark with her cover intact.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.030
You remember
Agent Coulson, right?

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.150
Yeah.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.710
Oh, and Tony...

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.030
Remember,
I got my eye on you.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.310
We've disabled
all communications.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.310
No contact with
the outside world.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.750
Good luck.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.070
Please.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.510
First thing, I need
a little bodywork.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.870
I'll put in a little
time at the lab.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.150
If we could send one of your goon
squad down to The Coffee Bean,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.510
Cross Creek, for
a Starbucks run,

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.830
or something like
that, that'd be nice.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.550
I'm not here for that.
I've been authorized by Director Fury

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.150
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.830
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.510
I will tase you and
watch <i>Supernanny</i>

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.110
while you drool into the carpet.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.190
Okay?

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.470
I think I got it, yeah.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.430
Enjoy your evening's
entertainment.

00:17:00.842 --> 00:17:02.693
Unbelievable.

00:17:03.123 --> 00:17:05.642
This ought to get
the Senate off my ass.

00:17:05.722 --> 00:17:07.362
It's functional?

00:17:07.442 --> 00:17:09.082
Fully mission-capable.

00:17:09.442 --> 00:17:12.842
Good. Get Hammer
down here to weaponize it.

00:17:13.842 --> 00:17:14.842
Sir?

00:17:14.922 --> 00:17:17.602
Justin Hammer's making a
weapons presentation at the Expo.

00:17:17.682 --> 00:17:19.322
We'd like this to introduce it.

00:17:19.402 --> 00:17:21.002
Sir, I don't believe
that the Expo...

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:23.842
Colonel, the world
needs to see this fast.

00:17:23.922 --> 00:17:25.402
We've got to make this happen.

00:17:25.482 --> 00:17:27.002
Yes, General, but...

00:17:27.082 --> 00:17:29.082
It's also an order.

00:17:29.402 --> 00:17:30.762
Yes, sir.

00:17:31.122 --> 00:17:34.642
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

00:17:34.722 --> 00:17:36.282
Thank you, sir.

00:17:42.092 --> 00:17:46.572
Hey, hey, hey.
Special delivery. Candygram.

00:17:51.052 --> 00:17:54.812
- I brought you something.
- Oh, yeah.

00:17:57.372 --> 00:17:59.212
We got you the bird, pal!

00:17:59.292 --> 00:18:00.652
This is not my bird.

00:18:01.052 --> 00:18:04.292
What do you mean? That's the bird.
This is the bird. Yeah!

00:18:04.412 --> 00:18:07.372
Pulled a lot of strings to get this bird.
This is a great bird.

00:18:07.452 --> 00:18:08.452
It's a beautiful bird.

00:18:08.532 --> 00:18:10.052
We got this all the
way from Russia.

00:18:10.223 --> 00:18:12.374
Hey, man, this not my bird.

00:18:14.972 --> 00:18:16.652
Well, listen, even
if it's not the bird,

00:18:16.732 --> 00:18:18.892
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

00:18:19.012 --> 00:18:23.252
I mean, you know, look, don't get
so attached to things. Learn to let go.

00:18:26.332 --> 00:18:28.532
Wait a minute.
Jack, what is that?

00:18:29.332 --> 00:18:32.492
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?

00:18:39.212 --> 00:18:40.932
Um...

00:18:41.012 --> 00:18:44.532
Ivan... What's this? Jack.

00:18:45.532 --> 00:18:47.572
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

00:18:47.652 --> 00:18:50.212
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

00:18:50.332 --> 00:18:52.092
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.

00:18:52.212 --> 00:18:53.412
Try to put your head in there.

00:18:53.492 --> 00:18:55.452
Go ahead.
Try to put your head in there.

00:18:55.532 --> 00:18:58.932
See, Ivan? He can't put
his head in there. That's...

00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:02.612
That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

00:19:02.692 --> 00:19:06.092
I need to fit a person in
that suit. You understand?

00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:07.412
Drone better.

00:19:07.492 --> 00:19:08.572
What? Drone better?

00:19:08.652 --> 00:19:11.252
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

00:19:11.332 --> 00:19:15.052
People make problem.
Trust me. Drone better.

00:19:15.532 --> 00:19:19.732
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

00:19:20.532 --> 00:19:22.452
You said, "No problem."

00:19:22.532 --> 00:19:25.412
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

00:19:25.532 --> 00:19:28.292
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

00:19:28.412 --> 00:19:30.372
Like Iron Man. You understand?

00:19:30.452 --> 00:19:33.572
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

00:19:34.412 --> 00:19:35.732
Hey, man.

00:19:37.292 --> 00:19:41.572
Don't get too attached to things.
Learn to let go.

00:19:45.412 --> 00:19:48.412
These drones better
steal the show, Ivan.

00:19:49.052 --> 00:19:52.412
You understand?
Better rock my world, Ivan.

00:20:03.284 --> 00:20:06.124
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

00:20:06.484 --> 00:20:08.484
<i>Please wait for the all-clear.</i>

00:20:08.804 --> 00:20:13.804
<i>Your attention, please. All citizens
shall remain indoors until further notice.</i>

00:20:14.484 --> 00:20:17.604
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

00:20:25.564 --> 00:20:27.564
Dr. Erskine said that

00:20:27.924 --> 00:20:30.404
the serum wouldn't
just affect my muscles,

00:20:30.484 --> 00:20:32.564
it would affect my cells.

00:20:33.564 --> 00:20:37.404
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

00:20:37.484 --> 00:20:39.164
Which means

00:20:41.404 --> 00:20:43.084
I can't get drunk.

00:20:44.844 --> 00:20:46.164
Did you know that?

00:20:46.604 --> 00:20:50.844
Your metabolism burns four times
faster than the average person.

00:20:52.564 --> 00:20:55.204
He thought it could be
one of the side effects.

00:21:00.204 --> 00:21:02.204
It wasn't your fault.

00:21:03.364 --> 00:21:05.044
- Did you read the report?
- Yes.

00:21:06.204 --> 00:21:07.524
Then you know that's not true.

00:21:07.564 --> 00:21:09.364
You did everything you could.

00:21:12.684 --> 00:21:14.884
Did you believe in your friend?

00:21:14.964 --> 00:21:16.444
Did you respect him?

00:21:18.044 --> 00:21:20.004
Then stop blaming yourself.

00:21:20.324 --> 00:21:22.724
Allow Barnes the
dignity of his choice.

00:21:22.854 --> 00:21:24.604
He damn well must have
thought you were worth it.

00:21:27.164 --> 00:21:28.724
I'm going after Schmidt.

00:21:30.324 --> 00:21:33.684
I'm not gonna stop until all
of Hydra is dead or captured.

00:21:35.564 --> 00:21:37.204
You won't be alone.

00:21:39.844 --> 00:21:43.044
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god,

00:21:43.124 --> 00:21:45.044
and he's willing to blow
up half the world to prove it,

00:21:45.164 --> 00:21:46.724
starting with the USA.

00:21:46.804 --> 00:21:49.924
Schmidt's working with
powers beyond our capabilities.

00:21:50.044 --> 00:21:51.764
He gets across the Atlantic,

00:21:51.844 --> 00:21:54.284
he will wipe out the entire
Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

00:21:58.764 --> 00:22:00.364
How much time we got?

00:22:00.404 --> 00:22:02.764
According to my new
best friend, under 24 hours.

00:22:02.804 --> 00:22:05.804
- Where is he now?
- Hydra's last base is here.

00:22:06.644 --> 00:22:10.084
In the Alps, 500 feet
below the surface.

00:22:12.084 --> 00:22:13.524
So what are we supposed to do?

00:22:13.604 --> 00:22:16.164
I mean, it's not like we can
just knock on the front door.

00:22:16.804 --> 00:22:18.124
Why not?

00:22:23.244 --> 00:22:25.444
That's exactly what
we're going to do.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:45.459
Tomorrow,

00:22:46.219 --> 00:22:49.539
Hydra will stand
master of the world,

00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:52.779
borne to victory on the
wings of the <i>Valkyrie.</i>

00:22:53.899 --> 00:22:57.819
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

00:22:58.459 --> 00:23:00.379
If they shoot down one plane,

00:23:00.459 --> 00:23:03.459
hundreds more will
rain fire upon them!

00:23:07.939 --> 00:23:10.299
If they cut off one head,

00:23:10.819 --> 00:23:13.659
two more shall take its place.

00:23:13.979 --> 00:23:15.299
Hail Hydra.

00:23:15.579 --> 00:23:16.579
Hail Hydra!
 Hail Hydra!

00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:21.636
Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!
Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!

00:23:42.568 --> 00:23:44.168
Think this is the power source?

00:23:44.248 --> 00:23:47.208
Major, this is not a
scientific exercise.

00:23:47.288 --> 00:23:49.248
Let's just focus on
arming it, all right?

00:23:50.208 --> 00:23:51.528
Yes, sir.

00:23:51.928 --> 00:23:53.248
Oh, yes!

00:23:53.608 --> 00:23:57.408
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Is it my birthday?

00:23:57.688 --> 00:24:01.088
You got it. What did you do?
What did you do?

00:24:01.408 --> 00:24:02.968
Oh!

00:24:04.248 --> 00:24:05.648
Is this what I think it is?

00:24:05.728 --> 00:24:07.048
Yes, it is.

00:24:07.128 --> 00:24:10.248
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:11.888
What am I going to do for you?

00:24:11.968 --> 00:24:13.288
Well, the first thing
I'm gonna do for you

00:24:13.368 --> 00:24:15.008
is I'm gonna upgrade
your software.

00:24:15.088 --> 00:24:16.248
And then, second,
I think I should...

00:24:16.368 --> 00:24:18.168
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:24:18.248 --> 00:24:20.568
I'm talking about firepower.

00:24:22.088 --> 00:24:23.168
Well, you're talking
to the right guy.

00:24:25.448 --> 00:24:28.728
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

00:24:30.008 --> 00:24:32.328
Too downtown? I agree.

00:24:32.928 --> 00:24:35.128
M24 shotgun, pump action.

00:24:35.768 --> 00:24:37.048
Five-round magazine.

00:24:37.128 --> 00:24:39.528
You know what? You're not a hunter.
What am I talking about?

00:24:39.608 --> 00:24:40.648
I'm getting rid of it.

00:24:40.768 --> 00:24:43.208
This is the FN-2000
from Belgium.

00:24:43.288 --> 00:24:45.088
They do make something
better than waffles.

00:24:46.408 --> 00:24:48.568
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

00:24:48.648 --> 00:24:49.888
so I'm gonna put it right here.

00:24:49.968 --> 00:24:53.048
You're looking at a Milkor
40mm grenade launcher.

00:24:53.128 --> 00:24:56.128
Tear gas, smoke.
Hippie control.

00:24:56.448 --> 00:24:57.728
You're tough.

00:24:57.808 --> 00:25:00.368
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

00:25:00.448 --> 00:25:01.928
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

00:25:02.328 --> 00:25:05.608
This is an M134 7.62 Minigun.

00:25:05.688 --> 00:25:09.208
Six individual barrels.
The torso taker, powder maker.

00:25:09.288 --> 00:25:11.408
Our boys in uniform
call it Uncle Gazpacho,

00:25:11.488 --> 00:25:13.848
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:17.968
Okay.

00:25:19.848 --> 00:25:23.288
These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

00:25:25.328 --> 00:25:27.248
This is a kinetic-kill,
side-winder vehicle

00:25:27.328 --> 00:25:31.648
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

00:25:32.168 --> 00:25:35.728
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

00:25:35.808 --> 00:25:37.928
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

00:25:38.008 --> 00:25:41.368
A book that would make <i>Ulysses</i>
look like it was written in crayon.

00:25:42.008 --> 00:25:43.328
It would read it to you.

00:25:43.968 --> 00:25:45.448
This is my Eiffel Tower.

00:25:45.528 --> 00:25:48.608
This is my Rachmaninoff's <i>Third.</i>
My <i>Pieta.</i>

00:25:48.688 --> 00:25:51.768
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

00:25:51.848 --> 00:25:56.568
It's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

00:25:57.688 --> 00:25:59.568
I call it the Ex-Wife.

00:26:04.728 --> 00:26:06.688
That's the best I got.

00:26:11.728 --> 00:26:13.448
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:16.328
You're like a sphinx.
I can't read you.

00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:17.648
I think I'll take it.

00:26:17.728 --> 00:26:19.288
Which one?

00:26:19.408 --> 00:26:20.448
All of it.

00:26:22.408 --> 00:26:23.408
All of it.

00:27:00.671 --> 00:27:04.471
<i>Everything is achievable
through technology.</i>

00:27:04.551 --> 00:27:06.991
<i>Better living, robust health</i>

00:27:07.071 --> 00:27:10.231
<i>and for the first time
in human history,</i>

00:27:10.311 --> 00:27:12.911
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

00:27:13.391 --> 00:27:14.591
<i>I'm Howard Stark,</i>

00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:18.751
<i>and everything you'll need for
the future can be found right here.</i>

00:27:18.831 --> 00:27:21.831
<i>City of the Future?
City of Tomorrow? City of...</i>

00:27:27.671 --> 00:27:28.831
<i>I'm Howard Stark,</i>

00:27:28.911 --> 00:27:32.791
<i>and everything you'll need in
the future can be found right here.</i>

00:27:32.871 --> 00:27:35.751
<i>So, from all of us
at Stark Industries,</i>

00:27:35.831 --> 00:27:37.391
<i>I would like to personally...</i>

00:27:38.751 --> 00:27:41.951
<i>Tony, what are you doing back there?
What is that? Put that back.</i>

00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:44.671
<i>Put it back where
you got it from.</i>

00:27:44.871 --> 00:27:47.071
<i>Where's your mother? Maria?</i>

00:27:47.511 --> 00:27:49.391
<i>Go on. Go, go, go, go.</i>

00:27:51.671 --> 00:27:53.951
<i>All right, I think we got...</i>

00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:56.071
<i>I'll... I'll...
I'll come in and...</i>

00:28:00.031 --> 00:28:01.911
<i>Are you waiting on me?</i>

00:28:03.711 --> 00:28:05.751
<i>So, from all of us
at Stark Industries,</i>

00:28:05.831 --> 00:28:08.351
<i>I'd like to personally show you</i>

00:28:09.111 --> 00:28:10.151
<i>my ass.</i>

00:28:10.231 --> 00:28:12.271
<i>I'd like to...
I can't... This is...</i>

00:28:12.351 --> 00:28:14.791
<i>I can't...
We have this, don't we?</i>

00:28:14.871 --> 00:28:16.791
<i>This is a ridiculous way...</i>

00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:19.791
<i>Everything</i>

00:28:20.791 --> 00:28:22.311
<i>is achievable</i>

00:28:23.031 --> 00:28:24.911
<i>through technology.</i>

00:28:37.391 --> 00:28:38.551
<i>Tony?</i>

00:28:38.631 --> 00:28:40.511
<i>You're too young to
understand this right now,</i>

00:28:40.591 --> 00:28:43.591
<i>so I thought I would
put it on film for you.</i>

00:28:45.431 --> 00:28:47.311
<i>I built this for you.</i>

00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:50.911
<i>And someday you'll realize
that it represents a whole lot more</i>

00:28:50.991 --> 00:28:54.951
<i>than just people's inventions.
It represents my life's work.</i>

00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:58.511
<i>This is the key to the future.</i>

00:29:01.431 --> 00:29:06.271
<i>I'm limited by the technology of my
time, but one day you'll figure this out.</i>

00:29:07.071 --> 00:29:08.791
<i>And when you do,</i>

00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:11.831
<i>you will change the world.</i>

00:29:13.271 --> 00:29:17.271
<i>What is and always will
be my greatest creation</i>

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:20.751
<i>is you.</i>

00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:43.391
$6. Six.

00:29:43.471 --> 00:29:44.751
I don't have any dough.

00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:46.431
- Here.
- No, sir, that's too much.

00:29:46.511 --> 00:29:47.711
No, it's fine. Take that.

00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:48.791
It's fine.

00:29:48.871 --> 00:29:49.871
No, <i>senor.</i>

00:29:50.031 --> 00:29:53.071
Take it. Take it.
I don't like people handing me things.

00:29:53.151 --> 00:29:55.031
If you just drop that
there, that'd be great.

00:29:55.351 --> 00:29:57.031
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

00:29:58.151 --> 00:29:59.471
We believe in you!

00:30:00.311 --> 00:30:02.751
It was an illegal seizure
of trademark property.

00:30:03.471 --> 00:30:04.551
- Miss Potts?
- Relax.

00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:05.711
- Mr. Stark...
- Is here.

00:30:05.831 --> 00:30:07.631
- He refuses...
- I don't. It's fine.

00:30:07.751 --> 00:30:08.751
I'll just be a second.

00:30:08.831 --> 00:30:10.271
Listen, it's our position

00:30:10.351 --> 00:30:12.671
that Stark has and
continues to maintain

00:30:12.751 --> 00:30:15.471
proprietary ownership
of the Mark II platform.

00:30:15.551 --> 00:30:17.951
<i>When Mr. Stark announced
he was indeed Iron Man,</i>

00:30:18.031 --> 00:30:19.271
<i>he was making a
promise to America.</i>

00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:20.591
No, the suit belongs to us.

00:30:20.671 --> 00:30:22.591
<i>We trusted that he
would look out for us.</i>

00:30:22.671 --> 00:30:23.671
Yeah, but you're not... Burt...

00:30:23.751 --> 00:30:24.751
<i>He obviously did not.</i>

00:30:24.831 --> 00:30:26.671
<i>- And now we learn that his secretary...</i>
- Yes, it does.

00:30:26.751 --> 00:30:29.591
<i>...a woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts,</i>

00:30:29.671 --> 00:30:32.431
<i>has been appointed as
CEO of Stark Industries.</i>

00:30:32.511 --> 00:30:33.591
<i>What are her qualifications?</i>

00:30:33.671 --> 00:30:34.751
No.

00:30:34.831 --> 00:30:36.431
<i>Ms. Potts is doing nothing
to manage this terrible...</i>

00:30:36.511 --> 00:30:38.031
- Mute.
- No...

00:30:38.831 --> 00:30:40.831
Burt... Burt...
Burt, listen to me.

00:30:40.911 --> 00:30:43.351
Don't tell me that we have the
best patent lawyers in the country

00:30:43.431 --> 00:30:45.511
and then not let me pursue this.

00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:46.991
I'll get this stuff out of here.

00:30:47.071 --> 00:30:49.911
Well, then, tell the
President to sign an order.

00:30:50.191 --> 00:30:52.151
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

00:30:52.231 --> 00:30:55.271
Hammer's giving some
presentation tomorrow evening.

00:30:55.351 --> 00:30:57.471
Will Tony Stark be there?

00:30:57.551 --> 00:30:58.631
Will I?

00:30:58.871 --> 00:30:59.911
No, he will not. Bye.

00:31:00.031 --> 00:31:01.111
I would like to be.

00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:03.471
- Got a minute?
- No.

00:31:03.551 --> 00:31:06.311
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.

00:31:07.711 --> 00:31:08.871
Twenty-nine.
Twenty-eight.

00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:10.031
Okay, I, um...

00:31:10.111 --> 00:31:11.791
I was just driving over here,

00:31:11.871 --> 00:31:14.351
and I thought I was coming to
basically apologize, but I'm not.

00:31:14.431 --> 00:31:15.791
Oh, you didn't come
here to apologize?

00:31:15.871 --> 00:31:17.231
Look, that goes without saying,

00:31:17.311 --> 00:31:18.911
and I'm working on that.

00:31:18.991 --> 00:31:22.991
But I haven't been
entirely upfront with you,

00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:24.231
and I just want to
try to make good.

00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:26.591
Can I move this?
This is crazy.

00:31:26.671 --> 00:31:27.831
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

00:31:27.911 --> 00:31:29.071
- I'm trying to get some...
- No.

00:31:31.791 --> 00:31:34.151
Do you know how short life is?

00:31:34.231 --> 00:31:37.311
And if I never got to express...

00:31:37.391 --> 00:31:39.111
And by the way, this is somewhat

00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:40.871
revelatory to me.
And I don't care...

00:31:40.951 --> 00:31:44.351
I mean, I care. It would be nice.
I'm not expecting you to...

00:31:44.431 --> 00:31:45.991
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.
I'm just gonna say it.

00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:47.511
Let me stop you
right here, okay?

00:31:47.591 --> 00:31:50.031
Because if you say
"I" one more time,

00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:52.911
I'm gonna actually hurl
something at your head, I think.

00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:55.431
I am trying to run a company.

00:31:55.511 --> 00:31:56.951
Do you have any
idea what that entails?

00:31:57.071 --> 00:31:58.071
Yes.

00:31:58.151 --> 00:32:01.191
People are relying on you to be
Iron Man and you've disappeared,

00:32:01.271 --> 00:32:04.591
and all I'm doing is putting out
your fires and taking the heat for it.

00:32:07.191 --> 00:32:10.671
I am trying to do the job
that you were meant to do.

00:32:14.431 --> 00:32:16.791
Did you bring me strawberries?

00:32:17.871 --> 00:32:21.271
Did you know that there's only one
thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

00:32:21.351 --> 00:32:23.631
Allergic to strawberries.
Mmm-hmm.

00:32:26.151 --> 00:32:27.191
This is progress, Pepper.

00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:29.991
I knew there was a correlation
between you and this.

00:32:30.951 --> 00:32:32.191
- I need you...
- I need you, too.

00:32:32.311 --> 00:32:33.391
That's what I'm trying to...

00:32:33.471 --> 00:32:34.951
...to leave now.

00:32:40.151 --> 00:32:41.511
Ms. Potts?

00:32:41.951 --> 00:32:43.631
Hi, come on in.

00:32:43.711 --> 00:32:45.471
Wheels up in 25 minutes.

00:32:46.031 --> 00:32:47.391
Thank you.

00:32:49.151 --> 00:32:50.631
- Anything else, boss?
- I'm good, Hap.

00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:53.831
No, I'll be just...
another minute.

00:32:54.831 --> 00:32:56.471
I lost both the kids
in the divorce.

00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:01.831
No.

00:33:03.991 --> 00:33:09.071
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?
Here at Stark Enterprises?

00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:12.471
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

00:33:12.551 --> 00:33:15.511
I thought you two
didn't get along.

00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:16.591
No. That's not so.

00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:18.871
It's just me you don't care for.

00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:20.111
No? Nothing?

00:33:20.191 --> 00:33:21.511
Actually, while you're here,

00:33:21.591 --> 00:33:24.671
maybe you and Natalie could discuss
the matter of the personal belongings.

00:33:24.751 --> 00:33:26.191
Absolutely.

00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:33.631
I'm surprised you can
keep your mouth shut.

00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:37.471
Boy, you're good. You are mind-blowingly
duplicitous. How do you do it?

00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:39.391
You just tear things...
You're a triple impostor.

00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:40.471
I've never seen
anything like you.

00:33:40.591 --> 00:33:41.791
Is there anything
real about you?

00:33:41.871 --> 00:33:42.951
Do you even speak Latin?

00:33:45.111 --> 00:33:47.791
Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?

00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:51.071
It means you can either drive yourself
home or I can have you collected.

00:33:52.711 --> 00:33:54.111
You're good!

00:34:53.911 --> 00:34:56.551
Jarvis, could you kindly
Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame?

00:34:56.631 --> 00:34:59.191
I need a manipulatable
projection.

00:35:06.431 --> 00:35:09.991
<i>1974 Stark Expo model
scan complete, sir.</i>

00:35:12.231 --> 00:35:14.071
How many buildings are there?

00:35:14.151 --> 00:35:16.631
<i>Am I to include the
Belgian waffle stands?</i>

00:35:16.711 --> 00:35:19.271
That was rhetorical.
Just show me.

00:35:25.391 --> 00:35:27.711
Uh-huh. Um...

00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:36.631
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?
Not unlike an atom.

00:35:36.751 --> 00:35:40.191
In which case the
nucleus would be here.

00:35:41.271 --> 00:35:42.591
Highlight the unisphere.

00:35:52.151 --> 00:35:55.071
Lose the footpaths.
Get rid of them.

00:35:55.151 --> 00:35:57.231
<i>What is it you're
trying to achieve, sir?</i>

00:35:57.311 --> 00:35:59.111
I'm discovering... Correction.

00:35:59.231 --> 00:36:03.191
I'm rediscovering a
new element, I believe.

00:36:03.951 --> 00:36:06.991
Lose the landscaping,
the shrubbery, the trees.

00:36:07.111 --> 00:36:09.391
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:20.191
Structure the protons and the neutrons
using the pavilions as a framework.

00:36:23.271 --> 00:36:24.391
Dad.

00:36:45.671 --> 00:36:50.431
Dead for almost 20 years,
and still taking me to school.

00:36:56.631 --> 00:37:01.271
<i>The proposed element should serve
as a viable replacement for palladium.</i>

00:37:01.351 --> 00:37:02.431
Thanks, Dad.

00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:05.751
<i>Unfortunately, it is
impossible to synthesize.</i>

00:37:06.191 --> 00:37:07.831
Uh-huh.

00:37:10.271 --> 00:37:13.871
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas!
We're back in hardware mode.

00:38:04.381 --> 00:38:07.021
<i>Initializing prismatic
accelerator.</i>

00:38:13.101 --> 00:38:15.541
<i>Approaching maximum power.</i>

00:38:28.141 --> 00:38:29.501
Whoops!

00:39:03.021 --> 00:39:04.261
That was easy.

00:39:20.821 --> 00:39:22.781
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

00:39:24.501 --> 00:39:27.021
<i>You have created a new element.</i>

00:39:34.941 --> 00:39:38.781
<i>Sir, the reactor has
accepted the modified core.</i>

00:39:38.861 --> 00:39:41.461
<i>I will begin
running diagnostics.</i>

00:39:47.341 --> 00:39:48.701
Hey, Ivan.

00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:50.621
<i>I got Senator Stern here.</i>

00:39:50.701 --> 00:39:53.061
<i>Thought we'd swing over and
look at some of the drone designs.</i>

00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:55.421
The drone is not
going to be ready.

00:39:55.661 --> 00:39:56.941
Not ready? What do you mean?

00:39:57.021 --> 00:40:00.461
I can make presentation,
not demonstration.

00:40:00.541 --> 00:40:02.541
What the hell is the difference?

00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:05.421
Presentation.
No fly. No shoot.

00:40:05.701 --> 00:40:07.581
Well, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

00:40:07.661 --> 00:40:10.781
What can you make them do?
I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.

00:40:10.861 --> 00:40:12.821
I can make salute.

00:40:12.901 --> 00:40:14.141
<i>You can make salute?</i>

00:40:14.221 --> 00:40:15.661
What do you mean, "make salute"?

00:40:15.741 --> 00:40:17.661
<i>What the hell does
that mean, Ivan?</i>

00:40:17.741 --> 00:40:19.821
<i>This is not what
we agreed to, okay?</i>

00:40:19.901 --> 00:40:22.541
<i>You promised me suits and
then you promised me drones.</i>

00:40:22.621 --> 00:40:25.221
Hey, man, everything
will be okay.

00:40:25.301 --> 00:40:26.701
<i>This is not what I wanted.</i>

00:42:38.117 --> 00:42:42.237
Arrogance may not be a
uniquely American trait,

00:42:42.317 --> 00:42:44.437
but I must say, you do
it better than anyone.

00:42:47.317 --> 00:42:49.997
But there are limits

00:42:50.317 --> 00:42:52.637
to what even you
can do, Captain.

00:42:53.117 --> 00:42:56.357
Or did Erskine
tell you otherwise?

00:42:56.437 --> 00:42:57.917
He told me you were insane.

00:42:59.037 --> 00:43:00.037
Ah.

00:43:02.833 --> 00:43:04.833
He resented my genius

00:43:04.873 --> 00:43:08.473
and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine.

00:43:08.513 --> 00:43:10.153
But he gave you everything.

00:43:12.553 --> 00:43:13.833
So,

00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:18.193
what made you so special?

00:43:21.393 --> 00:43:22.553
Nothing.

00:43:23.713 --> 00:43:25.273
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

00:43:36.753 --> 00:43:38.393
I can do this all day.

00:43:38.433 --> 00:43:40.473
Of course you can, of course.

00:43:40.553 --> 00:43:43.913
But, unfortunately, I
am on a tight schedule.

00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:50.953
So am I.

00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:06.073
Rogers!
You might need this!

00:44:06.513 --> 00:44:07.513
Thanks!

00:44:18.713 --> 00:44:21.273
We're in!
Assault team, go!

00:44:21.433 --> 00:44:22.793
Move out!

00:44:23.673 --> 00:44:25.433
Move!

00:44:31.313 --> 00:44:33.393
Keep your spacing!

00:45:12.993 --> 00:45:15.153
Cut off one head,
two more shall...

00:45:16.673 --> 00:45:18.353
Let's go find two more!

00:45:45.073 --> 00:45:46.073
You're late.

00:45:49.073 --> 00:45:51.073
- Weren't you about to...
- Right.

00:47:05.713 --> 00:47:06.753
Get in!

00:47:35.433 --> 00:47:36.753
- Keep it steady!
- Wait!

00:47:42.313 --> 00:47:43.513
Go get him.

00:47:45.473 --> 00:47:47.153
I'm not kissing you!

00:51:26.633 --> 00:51:29.793
- You don't give up, do you?
- Nope!

00:52:38.593 --> 00:52:41.233
You could have the
power of the gods!

00:52:41.913 --> 00:52:44.113
Yet you wear a
flag on your chest

00:52:44.153 --> 00:52:46.553
and think you fight
a battle of nations!

00:52:47.433 --> 00:52:49.593
I have seen the future, Captain!

00:52:50.513 --> 00:52:53.633
- There are no flags!
- Not my future!

00:53:07.473 --> 00:53:08.513
What have you done?

00:53:09.473 --> 00:53:10.473
No!

00:54:18.713 --> 00:54:20.833
<i>Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?</i>

00:54:21.033 --> 00:54:22.233
Captain Rogers, what is your...

00:54:22.313 --> 00:54:23.753
Steve, is that you?
Are you all right?

00:54:23.833 --> 00:54:25.353
<i>Peggy, Schmidt's dead!</i>

00:54:26.033 --> 00:54:27.593
<i>What about the plane?</i>

00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:30.913
That's a little bit
tougher to explain.

00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:33.753
Give me your coordinates.
I'll find you a safe landing site.

00:54:35.033 --> 00:54:37.193
There's not gonna
be a safe landing.

00:54:37.393 --> 00:54:39.033
<i>But I can try and force it down.</i>

00:54:39.113 --> 00:54:41.113
I'll get Howard on the line.
He'll know what to do.

00:54:41.193 --> 00:54:42.233
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

00:54:42.273 --> 00:54:44.873
<i>This thing's moving too fast
and it's heading for New York.</i>

00:54:49.473 --> 00:54:51.273
I got to put her in the water.

00:54:51.753 --> 00:54:54.433
Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.

00:54:54.753 --> 00:54:55.913
Right now I'm in the
middle of nowhere.

00:54:55.953 --> 00:54:58.393
If I wait any longer, a lot
of people are gonna die.

00:55:03.913 --> 00:55:05.113
Peggy,

00:55:06.913 --> 00:55:08.193
this is my choice.

00:55:32.433 --> 00:55:33.593
Peggy?

00:55:34.433 --> 00:55:35.793
<i>I'm here.</i>

00:55:38.633 --> 00:55:41.433
I'm gonna need a rain
check on that dance.

00:55:49.633 --> 00:55:50.793
All right.

00:55:53.793 --> 00:55:56.153
A week, next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.

00:55:57.633 --> 00:55:58.953
You got it.

00:56:00.833 --> 00:56:04.833
<i>8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late. Understood?</i>

00:56:07.193 --> 00:56:09.313
You know, I still don't
know how to dance.

00:56:15.473 --> 00:56:18.473
I'll show you how.
Just be there.

00:56:19.833 --> 00:56:21.473
We'll have the band
play something slow.

00:56:25.436 --> 00:56:27.036
<i>I'd hate to step on your...</i>

00:56:29.997 --> 00:56:30.997
Steve?

00:56:33.673 --> 00:56:34.993
Steve?

00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:39.553
Steve?

00:57:38.553 --> 00:57:40.073
To the Captain.

00:57:52.233 --> 00:57:53.233
Sir?

00:58:03.353 --> 00:58:05.353
Take us to the next grid point.

00:58:05.593 --> 00:58:07.673
But there's no
trace of wreckage.

00:58:08.353 --> 00:58:11.033
And the energy
signature stops here.

00:58:12.113 --> 00:58:13.833
Just keep looking.
