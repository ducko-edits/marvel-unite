00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:15.356
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

00:00:16.507 --> 00:00:18.918
<i>It is on a little world…</i>

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.482
<i>a human world.</i>

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:25.395
<i>They would wield its power…</i>

00:00:25.887 --> 00:00:31.601
<i>but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.</i>

00:00:33.103 --> 00:00:35.836
<i>He is ready to lead…</i>

00:00:36.398 --> 00:00:38.255
<i>and our force…</i>

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.434
<i>our Chitauri…</i>

00:00:40.517 --> 00:00:42.164
<i>will follow.</i>

00:00:43.447 --> 00:00:45.850
<i>A world will be his.</i>

00:00:45.987 --> 00:00:48.749
<i>The universe yours.</i>

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:50.785
<i>And the humans…</i>

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:52.826
<i>what can they do?</i>

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:54.924
<i>But burn!</i>

00:01:34.736 --> 00:01:38.175
<i>All personnel.
The evacuation order has been confirmed.</i>

00:01:38.258 --> 00:01:42.279
<i>Proceed your dedicated vehicle
for faster evacuation.</i>

00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:44.422
<i>Is not a drill!</i>

00:01:44.547 --> 00:01:46.017
<i>Emergency personnel.</i>

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.367
<i>Proceed your dedicated
vehicle for faster evacuation.</i>

00:02:10.118 --> 00:02:11.561
How bad is it?

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:13.183
That's the problem, sir.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.648
We don't know.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.700
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

00:02:21.783 --> 00:02:23.785
NASA didn't authorize Selvig
to go to test phase.

00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:26.196
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:27.289
Spontaneous event.

00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:28.592
It just turned itself on?

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:29.858
Where are the energy levels now?

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.295
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down,
we ordered evac.

00:02:32.378 --> 00:02:33.457
How long to get everyone out?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.234
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

00:02:35.317 --> 00:02:36.470
Do better.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.676
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.261
We should tell them to go back to sleep?

00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:43.563
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy…

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:46.141
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

00:02:46.224 --> 00:02:49.144
I need you to make sure the Phase 2
prototypes are shipped out.

00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:51.396
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.150
Until such time as the world ends…

00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:55.736
we will act as though it intends to spin on.

00:02:56.317 --> 00:02:57.819
Clear out the tech below.

00:02:57.902 --> 00:03:00.363
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.672
Yes, sir.

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.292
With me.

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:07.844
Talk to me, Doctor.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.555
Director.

00:03:10.638 --> 00:03:12.542
Is there anything we know for certain?

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.733
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

00:03:15.044 --> 00:03:17.819
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

00:03:18.047 --> 00:03:20.450
The Tesseract is not only active, she's…

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:21.527
behaving.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.927
I assume you pulled the plug.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.658
She's an energy source.

00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:27.536
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

00:03:28.182 --> 00:03:29.299
If she reaches peak level…

00:03:29.382 --> 00:03:31.090
We prepared for this, Doctor.

00:03:31.173 --> 00:03:32.965
Harnessing energy from space.

00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:34.522
But we don't have the harness.

00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:36.241
My calculations are far from complete.

00:03:36.324 --> 00:03:38.767
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.283
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.665
That can be harmful.

00:03:43.748 --> 00:03:45.287
Where's Agent Barton?

00:03:45.681 --> 00:03:46.901
The Hawk?

00:03:48.035 --> 00:03:50.004
Up in his nest, as usual.

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.374
<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>

00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:55.337
I gave you this detail…

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.060
so you could keep
a close eye on things.

00:03:57.143 --> 00:03:58.797
Well, I see better from a distance.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.174
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:03.319
Doctor, it's spiking again.

00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:05.082
No one's come or gone.

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.815
And Selvig's clean.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.970
No contacts, no IMs.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.310
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.944
At this end?

00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:18.642
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway
to the other end of space, right?

00:04:20.776 --> 00:04:22.328
Doors open from both sides.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:24.288
Not yet.

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.484
Sir, please put down the spear.

00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:16.040
You have heart.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.838
Please don't.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.969
I still need that.

00:06:51.052 --> 00:06:52.637
This doesn't have to get any messier.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.972
Of course it does.

00:06:54.055 --> 00:06:56.148
I've come too far for anything else.

00:06:57.725 --> 00:06:59.277
I am Loki…

00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:01.150
of Asgard.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.982
And I am burdened
with glorious purpose.

00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:05.354
Loki…

00:07:05.983 --> 00:07:07.440
brother of Thor.

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:09.995
We have no quarrel with your people.

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:13.165
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:15.660
Are you planning to step on us?

00:07:15.743 --> 00:07:18.192
I come with glad tidings…

00:07:20.018 --> 00:07:21.986
of a world made free.

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:23.418
Free from what?

00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:24.743
Freedom.

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.989
Freedom is life's great lie.

00:07:28.255 --> 00:07:30.150
Once you accept that…

00:07:30.344 --> 00:07:32.023
in your heart…

00:07:36.097 --> 00:07:38.107
you will know peace.

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:40.425
Yeah, you say peace…

00:07:41.018 --> 00:07:42.958
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:45.377
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

00:07:45.773 --> 00:07:47.331
This place is about to blow…

00:07:47.414 --> 00:07:49.593
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:51.442
He means to bury us.

00:07:51.525 --> 00:07:52.905
Like the pharaohs of old.

00:07:52.988 --> 00:07:55.116
He's right.
The portal is collapsing in on itself.

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.744
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

00:07:57.829 --> 00:07:59.130
Well, then.

00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:15.897
I need these vehicles.

00:08:19.598 --> 00:08:20.760
Who's that?

00:08:20.843 --> 00:08:22.247
They didn't tell me.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.178
<i>Hill!</i>

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:28.151
Do you copy?

00:08:28.673 --> 00:08:30.317
<i>Barton has turned.</i>

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.719
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:24.886
Let's go. No, no, no, leave it.
Leave it. Go!

00:09:41.055 --> 00:09:43.232
We're clear upstairs, sir.
<i>You need to go.</i>

00:11:15.024 --> 00:11:16.500
<i>Director?</i>

00:11:16.817 --> 00:11:18.452
Director Fury, do you copy?

00:11:18.742 --> 00:11:20.905
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

00:11:20.988 --> 00:11:22.225
I have men down.

00:11:22.308 --> 00:11:23.387
Hill?

00:11:23.824 --> 00:11:25.415
A lot of men still under.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.551
I don't know how many survivors.

00:11:27.828 --> 00:11:28.965
<i>Sound a general call.</i>

00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:29.950
<i>I want every living soul…</i>

00:11:30.033 --> 00:11:32.133
not working rescue
looking for that briefcase.

00:11:32.216 --> 00:11:33.124
Roger that.

00:11:33.207 --> 00:11:34.906
Coulson, get back to base.

00:11:34.989 --> 00:11:36.809
<i>This is a Level Seven.</i>

00:11:37.838 --> 00:11:39.293
<i>As of right now…</i>

00:11:39.376 --> 00:11:41.232
we are at war.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.985
What do we do?

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:40.990
<i>You're at 1-14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.</i>

00:13:41.164 --> 00:13:43.629
<i>We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.</i>

00:13:44.084 --> 00:13:46.086
<i>Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block…</i>

00:13:46.169 --> 00:13:47.958
<i>before you can make the lobby.</i>

00:13:54.845 --> 00:13:57.097
<i>- We need you to come in.</i>
- Are you kidding, I'm working.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.599
<i>This takes precedence.</i>

00:13:58.682 --> 00:14:00.269
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

00:14:00.352 --> 00:14:02.406
This moron is giving me everything.

00:14:02.686 --> 00:14:05.447
I don't give everything.

00:14:06.731 --> 00:14:07.983
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

00:14:08.066 --> 00:14:09.367
<i>Natasha…</i>

00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:12.454
Barton's been compromised.

00:14:15.532 --> 00:14:17.095
Let me put you on hold.

00:14:59.117 --> 00:15:00.202
Where is Barton now?

00:15:00.285 --> 00:15:01.912
<i>- We don't know.</i>
- But he's alive?

00:15:01.995 --> 00:15:03.005
We think so.

00:15:03.088 --> 00:15:04.915
I'll brief you on everything
when you get back.

00:15:04.998 --> 00:15:07.172
But first, we need you
to talk to the big guy.

00:15:07.255 --> 00:15:10.391
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.445
I've got Stark.

00:15:12.698 --> 00:15:14.234
You get the big guy.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.245
You're a doctor.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.580
Please.

00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:33.085
You should've got paid up front, Banner.

00:16:33.378 --> 00:16:36.155
You know, for a man who's supposed
to be avoiding stress…

00:16:36.238 --> 00:16:38.864
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

00:16:41.303 --> 00:16:43.474
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

00:16:43.722 --> 00:16:45.802
Then what is it?
Yoga?

00:16:47.392 --> 00:16:48.866
You brought me to the edge of the city.

00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:50.067
Smart.

00:16:51.153 --> 00:16:54.183
I assume the whole place is surrounded.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.096
Just you and me.

00:16:58.278 --> 00:17:00.269
And your actress buddy?

00:17:00.443 --> 00:17:02.630
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

00:17:02.907 --> 00:17:04.064
I did.

00:17:04.367 --> 00:17:05.374
Who are you?

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:06.886
Natasha Romanoff.

00:17:10.081 --> 00:17:11.623
Are you here to kill me, Ms. Romanoff?

00:17:11.706 --> 00:17:14.041
Because that's not going
to work out for everyone.

00:17:14.124 --> 00:17:16.970
No, of course not.
I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:17:18.757 --> 00:17:20.133
S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:17:21.852 --> 00:17:23.136
How did they find me?

00:17:23.219 --> 00:17:24.557
We never lost you, Doctor.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.056
We've kept our distance.

00:17:26.139 --> 00:17:29.159
Even helped keep some other
interested parties off your scent.

00:17:29.768 --> 00:17:30.764
Why?

00:17:30.847 --> 00:17:33.066
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.114
But now we need you to come in.

00:17:36.066 --> 00:17:37.511
What if I say no?

00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:39.789
I'll persuade you.

00:17:42.405 --> 00:17:43.904
And what if…

00:17:44.309 --> 00:17:46.214
the other guy says no?

00:17:47.452 --> 00:17:49.139
You've been more than
a year without an incident.

00:17:49.222 --> 00:17:51.416
I don't think you want
to break that streak.

00:17:54.084 --> 00:17:56.553
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

00:17:57.754 --> 00:18:00.438
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

00:18:01.699 --> 00:18:04.177
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.646
This…

00:18:06.426 --> 00:18:08.075
is the Tesseract.

00:18:08.765 --> 00:18:11.529
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

00:18:14.729 --> 00:18:16.906
What does Fury want me
to do, swallow it?

00:18:17.045 --> 00:18:18.552
He wants you to find it.

00:18:18.809 --> 00:18:20.015
It's been taken.

00:18:20.347 --> 00:18:24.124
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

00:18:24.718 --> 00:18:27.419
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:29.112
If there was…

00:18:29.407 --> 00:18:30.902
that's where I'd be.

00:18:31.287 --> 00:18:33.473
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

00:18:33.556 --> 00:18:35.042
Not that he's told me.

00:18:35.125 --> 00:18:36.901
And he tells you everything?

00:18:37.961 --> 00:18:39.509
Talk to Fury.
He needs you on this.

00:18:39.592 --> 00:18:40.679
He needs me in a cage?

00:18:40.762 --> 00:18:41.719
No one's going to put you in a…

00:18:41.802 --> 00:18:43.057
Stop lying to me!

00:18:46.948 --> 00:18:48.978
I'm sorry.
That was mean.

00:18:50.598 --> 00:18:52.385
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

00:18:53.977 --> 00:18:54.993
Why don't we…

00:18:55.605 --> 00:18:57.064
do this the easy way…

00:18:57.147 --> 00:18:58.474
where you don't use that…

00:18:58.557 --> 00:19:02.539
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

00:19:03.194 --> 00:19:04.194
Ok?

00:19:05.488 --> 00:19:06.488
Natasha?

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.005
Stand down.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.005
<i>We're good here.</i>

00:19:17.938 --> 00:19:19.373
Just you and me.

00:19:21.713 --> 00:19:24.284
<i>This is out of line, Director.</i>

00:19:24.507 --> 00:19:26.976
<i>You're dealing with forces
you can't control.</i>

00:19:27.343 --> 00:19:29.211
You ever been in a war, Councilman?

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:30.671
In a firefight?

00:19:31.014 --> 00:19:33.728
Did you feel an overabundance of control?

00:19:34.017 --> 00:19:37.356
<i>You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?</i>

00:19:37.439 --> 00:19:39.909
Not Asgard.
Loki.

00:19:40.238 --> 00:19:42.875
<i>He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?</i>

00:19:43.276 --> 00:19:44.197
<i>His brother.</i>

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.485
<i>Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile.</i>

00:19:46.568 --> 00:19:47.781
But he's worlds away.

00:19:47.864 --> 00:19:49.700
We can't depend on him to help, either.

00:19:49.783 --> 00:19:50.703
It's up to us.

00:19:50.786 --> 00:19:53.620
<i>Which is why you should be
focusing on Phase 2.</i>

00:19:53.703 --> 00:19:54.912
<i>It was designed for exactly this…</i>

00:19:54.995 --> 00:19:56.743
Phase 2 isn't ready.

00:19:56.826 --> 00:19:58.284
Our enemy is.

00:19:58.555 --> 00:20:00.159
We need a response team.

00:20:00.242 --> 00:20:02.687
<i>The Avengers Initiative
was shut down.</i>

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.524
This isn't about the Avengers.

00:20:04.607 --> 00:20:05.906
<i>We've seen the list.</i>

00:20:05.989 --> 00:20:08.300
<i>You're running the world's greatest
covert security network…</i>

00:20:08.383 --> 00:20:10.151
<i>and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race…</i>

00:20:10.234 --> 00:20:11.497
<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.632
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

00:20:13.715 --> 00:20:15.934
We need a response team.

00:20:16.246 --> 00:20:19.146
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even…

00:20:19.229 --> 00:20:20.964
but I believe with the right push…

00:20:21.047 --> 00:20:23.390
they can be exactly what we need.

00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:24.938
<i>You believe?</i>

00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:28.761
<i>War isn't won by sentiment, Director.</i>

00:20:29.489 --> 00:20:32.733
No, it's won by soldiers.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:53.961
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

00:20:54.222 --> 00:20:56.065
<i>I got to put her in the water!</i>

00:21:01.371 --> 00:21:02.689
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

00:21:02.772 --> 00:21:04.407
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

00:21:04.856 --> 00:21:06.366
<i>This guy is still alive!</i>

00:21:30.925 --> 00:21:32.211
Trouble sleeping?

00:21:34.012 --> 00:21:35.518
I slept for 70 years, sir.

00:21:35.601 --> 00:21:36.773
I think I've had my fill.

00:21:38.224 --> 00:21:39.377
Then you should be out…

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.779
celebrating…

00:21:40.973 --> 00:21:42.334
seeing the world.

00:21:47.773 --> 00:21:50.551
When I went under,
the world was at war.

00:21:50.904 --> 00:21:52.747
I wake up, they say we won.

00:21:53.573 --> 00:21:55.124
They didn't say what we lost.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.085
We've made some
mistakes along the way.

00:21:58.453 --> 00:22:00.129
Some, very recently.

00:22:01.664 --> 00:22:02.904
Are you here with a mission, sir?

00:22:02.987 --> 00:22:04.031
I am.

00:22:04.125 --> 00:22:05.843
Trying to get me back in the world?

00:22:06.294 --> 00:22:07.769
Trying to save it.

00:22:12.634 --> 00:22:14.360
HYDRA'S secret weapon.

00:22:14.844 --> 00:22:18.489
Howard Stark fished that out of
the ocean when he was looking for you.

00:22:18.723 --> 00:22:20.559
He thought what we think.

00:22:20.642 --> 00:22:24.779
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

00:22:25.229 --> 00:22:28.114
That's something the world sorely needs.

00:22:30.478 --> 00:22:31.706
Who took it from you?

00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:33.448
He's called Loki.

00:22:33.571 --> 00:22:35.996
He's not from around here.

00:22:36.597 --> 00:22:39.967
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up
to speed on if you're in.

00:22:40.912 --> 00:22:44.572
The world has gotten even stranger
than you already know.

00:22:44.655 --> 00:22:47.081
At this point, I doubt anything
would surprise me.

00:22:47.961 --> 00:22:49.679
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

00:22:51.381 --> 00:22:54.650
There's a debriefing packet waiting
for you back at your apartment.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.947
Is there anything you can tell us about
the Tesseract that we ought to know now?

00:23:01.161 --> 00:23:03.096
You should have left it in the ocean.

00:23:36.259 --> 00:23:37.480
Good to go on this end.

00:23:37.563 --> 00:23:39.091
The rest is up to you.

00:23:39.174 --> 00:23:40.651
<i>You disconnected
the transmission lines?</i>

00:23:40.734 --> 00:23:41.738
<i>Are we off the grid?</i>

00:23:41.821 --> 00:23:45.727
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
of self-sustaining clean energy.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:49.309
<i>Well, assuming the arc reactor takes
over and it actually works.</i>

00:23:49.392 --> 00:23:50.664
I assume.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.361
Light her up.

00:23:57.947 --> 00:23:58.867
<i>How does it look?</i>

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.868
Like Christmas, but with more me.

00:24:01.951 --> 00:24:03.523
<i>We've got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign.</i>

00:24:03.606 --> 00:24:05.068
<i>You need to do some press.</i>

00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:06.414
<i>I'm in DC tomorrow…</i>

00:24:06.497 --> 00:24:07.999
<i>I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.</i>

00:24:08.082 --> 00:24:10.537
Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?

00:24:10.666 --> 00:24:11.804
Enjoy the moment.

00:24:11.887 --> 00:24:13.585
<i>Get in here and I will.</i>

00:24:16.632 --> 00:24:19.761
<i>Sir, Agent Coulson of
S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line.</i>

00:24:19.844 --> 00:24:21.067
<i>I'm not in.</i>

00:24:21.763 --> 00:24:23.020
I'm actually out.

00:24:30.271 --> 00:24:32.619
<i>Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.</i>

00:24:33.016 --> 00:24:34.465
Grow aspine, Jarvis.

00:24:34.548 --> 00:24:35.631
I got a date.

00:24:40.406 --> 00:24:42.161
Levels are holding steady…

00:24:42.759 --> 00:24:43.435
I think.

00:24:43.518 --> 00:24:45.870
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

00:24:45.953 --> 00:24:47.104
Which brings me to my next question.

00:24:47.187 --> 00:24:49.182
How does it feel to be a genius?

00:24:49.265 --> 00:24:51.740
Well, I really wouldn't know, now would I?

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:53.777
What do you mean? All this…

00:24:54.597 --> 00:24:56.187
came from you.

00:24:56.396 --> 00:24:59.407
No all this, came from that.

00:25:00.468 --> 00:25:01.577
Give yourself some credit.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.652
Please.

00:25:02.735 --> 00:25:04.685
Stark Tower is your baby.

00:25:04.768 --> 00:25:07.363
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

00:25:08.167 --> 00:25:08.814
12%?

00:25:08.897 --> 00:25:10.152
An argument can be made for 15.

00:25:10.235 --> 00:25:12.221
- 12% for my baby?
- Well I…

00:25:12.304 --> 00:25:13.773
did do all the heavy lifting.

00:25:13.856 --> 00:25:15.859
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

00:25:15.942 --> 00:25:18.278
And sorry, but the security snafu?

00:25:18.361 --> 00:25:19.762
That was on you.

00:25:19.907 --> 00:25:21.786
- My private elevator…
- You mean our elevator?

00:25:21.869 --> 00:25:24.390
It was teeming with sweaty workmen.

00:25:24.977 --> 00:25:27.567
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages…

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.744
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:31.395
It's not going to be that subtle.

00:25:31.478 --> 00:25:32.742
I'll tell you what.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.462
The next building is gonna say
Potts on the tower.

00:25:35.545 --> 00:25:36.958
On the lease.

00:25:37.864 --> 00:25:39.681
Call your mom can you bunk over?

00:25:40.236 --> 00:25:41.566
<i>Sir, the telephone.</i>

00:25:41.649 --> 00:25:44.204
<i>I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.</i>

00:25:44.287 --> 00:25:45.908
<i>Mr. Stark, we need to talk.</i>

00:25:46.556 --> 00:25:49.300
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

00:25:49.383 --> 00:25:51.170
- Please leave a message.
<i>- This is urgent.</i>

00:25:51.253 --> 00:25:53.131
Then leave it urgently.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.982
Security breach.
It's on you.

00:25:56.065 --> 00:25:56.795
Mr. Stark.

00:25:56.878 --> 00:25:58.693
Phil! Come in.

00:25:58.776 --> 00:25:59.819
Phil?

00:25:59.902 --> 00:26:01.041
I can't stay.

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:02.830
His first name is Agent.

00:26:02.989 --> 00:26:04.201
Come on in.
We're celebrating.

00:26:04.284 --> 00:26:06.009
Which is why he can't stay.

00:26:06.513 --> 00:26:08.630
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

00:26:08.713 --> 00:26:09.744
I don't like being handed things.

00:26:09.827 --> 00:26:11.331
That's fine, because I love
to be handed things.

00:26:11.414 --> 00:26:13.090
So, let's trade.

00:26:14.333 --> 00:26:15.777
Thank you.

00:26:17.044 --> 00:26:20.133
Official consulting hours are between
8 and 5 every other Thursday.

00:26:20.216 --> 00:26:21.397
This isn't a consultation.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.080
Is this about the Avengers?

00:26:23.256 --> 00:26:25.255
Which I know nothing about.

00:26:25.428 --> 00:26:27.536
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped…

00:26:27.661 --> 00:26:29.680
I thought and I didn't even qualify.

00:26:29.763 --> 00:26:30.620
I didn't know that either.

00:26:30.703 --> 00:26:32.721
Yeah apparently I'm volatile…

00:26:32.835 --> 00:26:33.994
self-obsessed…

00:26:34.077 --> 00:26:35.423
don't play well with others.

00:26:35.506 --> 00:26:36.303
That I did know.

00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:38.156
This isn't about personality
profiles anymore.

00:26:38.239 --> 00:26:40.860
Whatever, Ms. Potts, got a second?

00:26:40.943 --> 00:26:42.244
Half a moment.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.702
You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

00:26:49.785 --> 00:26:51.782
I was having 12% of a moment.

00:26:52.538 --> 00:26:55.160
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

00:26:55.243 --> 00:26:57.136
How would you know if it's…
Why is he Phil?

00:26:57.219 --> 00:26:58.913
What is all this?

00:26:59.274 --> 00:27:00.355
This is…

00:27:01.589 --> 00:27:02.848
This.

00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:11.682
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

00:27:11.765 --> 00:27:12.430
Tomorrow.

00:27:12.513 --> 00:27:15.061
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

00:27:15.144 --> 00:27:16.854
Well, what if I didn't?

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.940
If you didn't?
Yeah.

00:27:19.023 --> 00:27:20.734
You mean when you've finished?

00:27:22.318 --> 00:27:23.618
Well…

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:25.809
Then…

00:27:30.534 --> 00:27:32.204
Square deal. Fly safe.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.758
Work hard.

00:27:40.294 --> 00:27:42.121
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

00:27:42.204 --> 00:27:44.598
<i>- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.</i>

00:27:45.132 --> 00:27:47.929
<i>I want to hear about the cellist.
Is that still a thing?</i>

00:27:48.012 --> 00:27:49.429
<i>She moved back to Portland.</i>

00:27:49.512 --> 00:27:50.812
<i>What?</i>

00:28:00.648 --> 00:28:02.905
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

00:28:06.779 --> 00:28:10.499
So, this Dr. Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

00:28:10.658 --> 00:28:12.054
A lot of people were.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.190
You were the world's first superhero.

00:28:14.745 --> 00:28:19.041
Banner thought gamma radiation might hold
the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.

00:28:19.709 --> 00:28:21.711
Didn't really go his way, did it?

00:28:21.794 --> 00:28:22.917
Not so much.

00:28:23.462 --> 00:28:26.403
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

00:28:28.384 --> 00:28:30.853
He's like a smart person.

00:28:32.763 --> 00:28:34.089
I got to say…

00:28:34.172 --> 00:28:35.774
it's an honor to meet you…

00:28:35.857 --> 00:28:37.389
officially.

00:28:37.643 --> 00:28:39.111
I've sort of met you, I mean…

00:28:39.194 --> 00:28:41.149
I watched you while
you were sleeping.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.328
I mean, I was, I was present…

00:28:45.411 --> 00:28:47.356
while you were unconscious…

00:28:47.506 --> 00:28:48.780
from the ice.

00:28:48.863 --> 00:28:49.908
You know, it's really just a…

00:28:49.991 --> 00:28:52.017
just a huge honor
to have you on board.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.100
This…

00:28:53.617 --> 00:28:55.536
I hope I'm the man for the job.

00:28:55.703 --> 00:28:56.806
Oh, you are.

00:28:56.889 --> 00:28:58.245
Absolutely.

00:28:58.789 --> 00:29:01.232
We made some modifications
to the uniform.

00:29:01.917 --> 00:29:03.503
I had a little design input.

00:29:03.586 --> 00:29:04.836
The uniform?

00:29:05.087 --> 00:29:06.911
Aren't the stars and stripes a little…

00:29:08.507 --> 00:29:09.937
old-fashioned?

00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:12.388
With everything that's happening…

00:29:13.274 --> 00:29:15.146
and the things that are about
to come to light…

00:29:15.752 --> 00:29:16.720
people might just…

00:29:16.803 --> 00:29:18.964
need a little old-fashioned.

00:29:51.801 --> 00:29:54.723
The Chitauri grow restless.

00:29:54.806 --> 00:29:56.445
Let them gird themselves.

00:29:56.806 --> 00:29:58.474
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

00:29:58.557 --> 00:29:59.942
Battle?

00:30:00.768 --> 00:30:03.893
Against the meager might of Earth?

00:30:03.976 --> 00:30:06.560
Glorious, not lengthy.

00:30:07.108 --> 00:30:10.983
If your force is
as formidable as you claim.

00:30:11.066 --> 00:30:12.992
You question us?

00:30:13.744 --> 00:30:15.581
You question him…

00:30:15.898 --> 00:30:18.432
he who put the scepter in your hand?

00:30:18.566 --> 00:30:21.664
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose…

00:30:21.747 --> 00:30:24.889
when you were cast out, defeated?

00:30:24.972 --> 00:30:26.365
I was a king!

00:30:26.976 --> 00:30:28.696
The rightful king of Asgard…

00:30:29.631 --> 00:30:30.830
betrayed.

00:30:31.465 --> 00:30:33.939
Your ambition is little…

00:30:34.022 --> 00:30:36.753
and born of childish need.

00:30:37.185 --> 00:30:42.725
We look beyond the Earth to the greater
worlds the Tesseract will unveil.

00:30:42.808 --> 00:30:44.609
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

00:30:46.897 --> 00:30:48.298
I don't threaten.

00:30:49.692 --> 00:30:51.978
But until I open the doors…

00:30:52.445 --> 00:30:55.518
until your force is mine to command…

00:30:56.824 --> 00:30:58.356
you are but words.

00:30:58.826 --> 00:31:02.516
You will have your war, Asgardian.

00:31:04.582 --> 00:31:06.404
If you fail…

00:31:07.585 --> 00:31:11.433
if the Tesseract is kept from us…

00:31:12.126 --> 00:31:13.910
there will be no realm…

00:31:13.993 --> 00:31:16.376
no barren moon…

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.858
no crevice where he cannot find you.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.479
You think you know pain?

00:31:24.602 --> 00:31:26.635
He will make you long…

00:31:26.948 --> 00:31:30.325
for something sweet as pain.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.238
Stow the captain's gear.
Yes, sir.

00:32:03.111 --> 00:32:04.375
Agent Romanoff…

00:32:04.741 --> 00:32:06.259
Captain Rogers.

00:32:06.519 --> 00:32:07.937
Ma'am.
Hi.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.639
They need you on the bridge.
They're starting the face-trace.

00:32:10.814 --> 00:32:12.141
See you there.

00:32:13.651 --> 00:32:17.253
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

00:32:18.072 --> 00:32:20.299
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

00:32:20.866 --> 00:32:23.870
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

00:32:23.953 --> 00:32:25.234
Trading cards?

00:32:25.371 --> 00:32:27.673
They're vintage.
He's very proud.

00:32:29.119 --> 00:32:30.754
Dr. Banner.

00:32:32.294 --> 00:32:33.929
Yeah, hi.

00:32:34.129 --> 00:32:35.481
They told me you would be coming.

00:32:35.564 --> 00:32:37.299
Word is, you can find the Cube.

00:32:38.175 --> 00:32:40.052
Is that the only word on me?

00:32:40.135 --> 00:32:41.845
Only word I care about.

00:32:44.144 --> 00:32:46.780
It must be strange for you, all of this.

00:32:47.351 --> 00:32:50.062
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

00:32:50.145 --> 00:32:52.919
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

00:32:53.127 --> 00:32:55.333
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

00:32:56.944 --> 00:32:58.884
<i>Flight crew, secure the deck.</i>

00:33:03.242 --> 00:33:05.168
Is this a submarine?

00:33:05.411 --> 00:33:06.412
Really?

00:33:06.495 --> 00:33:09.902
They want me in a submerged,
pressurized, metal container?

00:33:36.358 --> 00:33:38.836
No, no, this is much worse.

00:34:08.891 --> 00:34:11.686
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

00:34:11.769 --> 00:34:13.998
Increase collective to 8%.

00:34:19.276 --> 00:34:21.396
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

00:34:21.479 --> 00:34:23.171
Increase output to capacity.

00:34:23.254 --> 00:34:25.504
Power plant performing at capacity.

00:34:25.587 --> 00:34:27.162
We are clear.

00:34:27.245 --> 00:34:28.867
All engines operating.

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:33.449
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

00:34:33.957 --> 00:34:35.107
We are at level, sir.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.242
Good.

00:34:36.919 --> 00:34:38.004
Let's vanish.

00:34:38.087 --> 00:34:40.488
Engage retro-reflection panels.

00:34:56.105 --> 00:34:57.802
Reflection panels engaged.

00:34:57.885 --> 00:34:59.341
Gentlemen.

00:35:11.453 --> 00:35:13.221
Doctor, thank you for coming.

00:35:14.769 --> 00:35:16.746
Thanks for asking nicely.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.644
So, how long am I staying?

00:35:19.727 --> 00:35:21.519
Once we get our hands
on the Tesseract…

00:35:21.602 --> 00:35:22.757
you're in the wind.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.320
Where are you with that?

00:35:24.893 --> 00:35:28.313
We're sweeping every wirelessly
accessible camera on the planet.

00:35:28.429 --> 00:35:30.605
Cell phones, laptops.

00:35:30.894 --> 00:35:32.384
If it's connected to a satellite…

00:35:32.467 --> 00:35:33.998
it's eyes and ears for us.

00:35:34.081 --> 00:35:35.519
That's still not gonna find them in time.

00:35:35.602 --> 00:35:36.729
You have to narrow your field.

00:35:36.812 --> 00:35:39.143
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

00:35:39.226 --> 00:35:40.902
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.

00:35:40.985 --> 00:35:44.403
Tell them to put the spectrometers on
the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays.

00:35:44.486 --> 00:35:47.823
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

00:35:47.906 --> 00:35:50.255
At least we could rule out a few places.

00:35:50.729 --> 00:35:52.264
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

00:35:52.682 --> 00:35:53.724
Agent Romanoff…

00:35:53.807 --> 00:35:56.236
could you show Dr. Banner
to his laboratory, please?

00:35:57.416 --> 00:35:59.885
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.774
Put it over there.

00:36:04.089 --> 00:36:06.342
Where did you find all these people?

00:36:06.425 --> 00:36:09.266
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

00:36:09.845 --> 00:36:11.097
Is this the stuff you need?

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.181
Yeah, iridium.

00:36:12.264 --> 00:36:15.017
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.786
It's very hard to get hold of.

00:36:16.935 --> 00:36:18.646
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
knows you need it.

00:36:18.729 --> 00:36:20.189
Well, I didn't know.

00:36:20.272 --> 00:36:21.441
Hey!

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.117
The Tesseract has shown me
so much it's…

00:36:24.443 --> 00:36:26.502
more than knowledge, it's truth.

00:36:26.585 --> 00:36:27.781
I know.

00:36:28.312 --> 00:36:30.199
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.535
My next target.

00:36:32.618 --> 00:36:34.039
Tell me what you need.

00:36:37.289 --> 00:36:38.705
I need a distraction.

00:36:39.917 --> 00:36:41.308
And an eyeball.

00:36:47.966 --> 00:36:50.636
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:52.255
No, no. It's fine.

00:36:55.057 --> 00:36:56.581
It's a vintage set.

00:36:56.892 --> 00:36:59.160
It took me a couple of years
to collect them all.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:02.898
Near mint.

00:37:02.981 --> 00:37:04.561
Slight foxing around the edges, but…

00:37:04.644 --> 00:37:07.278
We got a hit, a 67% match.

00:37:07.361 --> 00:37:09.706
Wait.
Cross match, 79%.

00:37:10.405 --> 00:37:11.437
Location?

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.656
Stuttgart, Germany.
28 Königstrasse.

00:37:14.743 --> 00:37:15.911
He's not exactly hiding.

00:37:15.994 --> 00:37:17.294
Captain…

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:19.046
you're up.

00:39:54.194 --> 00:39:55.662
Kneel before me.

00:39:59.783 --> 00:40:01.418
I said…

00:40:03.161 --> 00:40:05.380
Kneel

00:40:14.631 --> 00:40:17.580
Is not this simpler?

00:40:19.594 --> 00:40:22.367
Is this not your natural state?

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.969
It's the unspoken truth of humanity…

00:40:28.478 --> 00:40:31.197
that you crave subjugation.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.365
The bright lure of freedom…

00:40:33.448 --> 00:40:38.272
diminishes your life's joy
in a mad scramble for power…

00:40:39.823 --> 00:40:41.412
for identity.

00:40:42.868 --> 00:40:44.730
You were made…

00:40:44.838 --> 00:40:46.497
to be ruled.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.141
In the end…

00:40:48.749 --> 00:40:50.566
you will always kneel.

00:40:58.425 --> 00:41:00.317
Not to men like you.

00:41:01.428 --> 00:41:03.396
There are no men like me.

00:41:04.181 --> 00:41:06.955
There are always men like you.

00:41:08.351 --> 00:41:10.211
Look to your elder, people.

00:41:12.397 --> 00:41:14.195
Let him be an example.

00:41:20.655 --> 00:41:23.315
You know, the last time
I was in Germany…

00:41:23.408 --> 00:41:26.376
and saw a man standing
above everybody else…

00:41:26.828 --> 00:41:28.414
we ended up disagreeing.

00:41:28.497 --> 00:41:29.940
The soldier.

00:41:32.334 --> 00:41:34.039
The man out of time.

00:41:34.345 --> 00:41:36.006
I'm not the one who's out of time.

00:41:39.049 --> 00:41:42.043
<i>Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.</i>

00:42:01.871 --> 00:42:03.365
Kneel.

00:42:03.698 --> 00:42:05.093
Not today!

00:42:07.035 --> 00:42:08.766
The guy's all over the place.

00:42:11.823 --> 00:42:14.408
<i>Agent Romanoff.
You miss me?</i>

00:42:31.059 --> 00:42:33.122
<i>Make your move,
Reindeer Games.</i>

00:42:41.074 --> 00:42:42.375
<i>Good move.</i>

00:42:43.989 --> 00:42:45.408
Mr. Stark.

00:42:46.074 --> 00:42:47.384
<i>Captain.</i>

00:42:54.457 --> 00:42:56.008
<i>Is he saying anything?</i>

00:42:56.293 --> 00:42:57.594
Not a word.

00:42:57.836 --> 00:43:00.026
<i>Just get him here.
We're low on time.</i>

00:43:02.775 --> 00:43:04.009
I don't like it.

00:43:04.092 --> 00:43:06.136
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

00:43:06.219 --> 00:43:08.138
I don't remember it being that easy.

00:43:08.221 --> 00:43:09.765
This guy packs a wallop.

00:43:09.848 --> 00:43:13.196
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

00:43:14.477 --> 00:43:16.021
What's your thing, Pilates?

00:43:16.104 --> 00:43:17.231
What?

00:43:17.314 --> 00:43:18.357
It's like calisthenics.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.723
You might have missed
a couple of things, you know.

00:43:20.806 --> 00:43:22.610
Doing time as a Capsicle.

00:43:24.321 --> 00:43:25.976
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

00:43:26.059 --> 00:43:28.770
Yeah, there is a lot of things Fury
doesn't tell you.

00:43:28.909 --> 00:43:30.827
Where's this coming from?

00:43:34.706 --> 00:43:36.014
What's the matter?

00:43:36.097 --> 00:43:37.699
Are you scared of a little lightning?

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.466
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

00:43:57.938 --> 00:43:59.447
What are you doing?

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:13.665
<i>And now there is that guy.</i>

00:44:13.748 --> 00:44:15.441
Another Asgardian?

00:44:15.872 --> 00:44:17.755
- That guy's a friendly?
<i>- Doesn't matter.</i>

00:44:17.838 --> 00:44:20.627
<i>If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.</i>

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.713
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

00:44:22.796 --> 00:44:25.223
<i>I have a plan. Attack.</i>

00:44:31.054 --> 00:44:32.798
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

00:44:33.056 --> 00:44:34.113
I don't see how I can.

00:44:34.196 --> 00:44:37.068
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

00:44:37.352 --> 00:44:38.799
There's only one God, ma'am.

00:44:38.882 --> 00:44:41.136
And I'm pretty sure
he doesn't dress like that.

00:44:56.621 --> 00:44:58.172
Where is the Tesseract?

00:44:58.573 --> 00:44:59.707
I missed you, too.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:01.749
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

00:45:01.835 --> 00:45:03.598
You should thank me.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.131
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy…

00:45:06.214 --> 00:45:09.051
did the Allfather have
to muster to conjure you here…

00:45:09.134 --> 00:45:10.766
to your precious Earth?

00:45:14.472 --> 00:45:16.107
I thought you dead.

00:45:17.392 --> 00:45:18.852
Did you mourn?

00:45:19.436 --> 00:45:20.671
We all did.

00:45:20.754 --> 00:45:21.555
Our father…

00:45:21.638 --> 00:45:24.123
Your father.

00:45:26.401 --> 00:45:28.979
He did tell you my true parentage,
did he not?

00:45:31.781 --> 00:45:33.862
We were raised together.

00:45:34.242 --> 00:45:37.111
We played together,
we fought together.

00:45:37.412 --> 00:45:38.705
Do you remember none of that?

00:45:38.788 --> 00:45:40.590
I remember a shadow.

00:45:42.234 --> 00:45:45.128
Living in the shade of your greatness.

00:45:46.004 --> 00:45:48.674
I remember you tossing me
into an abyss.

00:45:48.757 --> 00:45:50.851
I was and should be king!

00:45:50.934 --> 00:45:53.203
So you take the world
I love as a recompense…

00:45:53.286 --> 00:45:55.030
for your imagined slights?

00:45:55.113 --> 00:45:55.988
No.

00:45:56.071 --> 00:45:58.515
The Earth is under my protection, Loki.

00:45:59.768 --> 00:46:03.363
And you're doing
a marvelous job with that.

00:46:03.772 --> 00:46:07.734
The humans slaughter each other
in droves while you idly fret.

00:46:07.817 --> 00:46:10.112
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

00:46:10.195 --> 00:46:12.075
You think yourself above them?

00:46:12.864 --> 00:46:13.784
Well, yes.

00:46:13.867 --> 00:46:16.669
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.303
A throne would suit you ill.

00:46:23.958 --> 00:46:26.659
I've seen worlds
you've never known about!

00:46:26.795 --> 00:46:28.066
I have grown…

00:46:28.149 --> 00:46:31.140
Odinson, in my exile.

00:46:31.466 --> 00:46:33.730
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract…

00:46:33.813 --> 00:46:34.720
and when I Wield it…

00:46:34.803 --> 00:46:36.516
Who showed you this power?

00:46:37.722 --> 00:46:39.130
Who controls the would-be king?

00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:41.222
- I am a king!
- Not here!

00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:42.426
You give up the Tesseract!

00:46:42.509 --> 00:46:44.606
You give up this poisonous dream!

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:49.450
Come home.

00:46:54.174 --> 00:46:55.642
I don't have it.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:59.452
You need the Cube to bring me home.

00:46:59.535 --> 00:47:01.712
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

00:47:02.872 --> 00:47:04.625
Listen well brother.

00:47:06.334 --> 00:47:07.927
I'm listening.

00:47:17.011 --> 00:47:18.757
Do not touch me again.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.565
Then don't take my stuff.

00:47:20.652 --> 00:47:23.284
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

00:47:24.561 --> 00:47:26.162
Shakespeare in the Park?

00:47:27.021 --> 00:47:28.428
Doth Mother know…

00:47:28.511 --> 00:47:30.460
you weareth her drapes?

00:47:30.567 --> 00:47:33.186
This is beyond you, metal man.

00:47:33.528 --> 00:47:35.781
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

00:47:35.864 --> 00:47:37.852
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours.

00:47:37.935 --> 00:47:39.005
Until then…

00:47:39.367 --> 00:47:40.918
<i>stay out of the way.</i>

00:47:42.412 --> 00:47:43.705
Tourist.

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:50.595
Ok.

00:48:20.241 --> 00:48:23.083
<i>Power at 400% capacity.</i>

00:48:23.411 --> 00:48:24.731
How about that?

00:49:25.083 --> 00:49:26.083
Hey!

00:49:28.977 --> 00:49:30.306
That's enough.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.609
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

00:49:35.692 --> 00:49:38.236
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

00:49:38.319 --> 00:49:39.615
Then prove it.

00:49:39.867 --> 00:49:40.980
Put that hammer down.

00:49:41.063 --> 00:49:42.032
Yeah. No.

00:49:42.115 --> 00:49:43.875
<i>Bad call. He loves his…</i>

00:49:45.493 --> 00:49:47.510
You want me to put the hammer down?

00:50:15.064 --> 00:50:16.402
Are we done, here?
