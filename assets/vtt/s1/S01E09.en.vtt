00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.499
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.299
It is on a little world,
a human world.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.379
They would wield its power,

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:31.419
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:36.019
<i>He is ready to lead</i>

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.619
<i>and our force, our
Chitauri, will follow.</i>

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:45.699
<i>A world will be his.</i>

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.979
<i>The universe, yours.</i>

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:55.099
<i>And the humans, what
can they do but burn?</i>

00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:39.345
<i>All personnel,</i>

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:41.745
<i>the evacuation order
has been confirmed.</i>

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.185
How bad is it?

00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:18.625
That's the problem, sir.
We don't know.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.985
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge

00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:25.185
from the Tesseract
four hours ago.

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:27.385
NASA didn't authorize
Selvig to go to test phase.

00:02:27.465 --> 00:02:29.545
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:30.745
Spontaneous event.

00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:32.065
It just turned itself on?

00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:33.305
Where are the energy levels now?

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:35.705
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:37.145
How long to get everyone out?

00:02:37.305 --> 00:02:38.665
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.145
Do better.

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:43.185
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:44.745
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:47.025
If we can't control the
Tesseract's energy,

00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:49.585
there may not be a
minimum safe distance.

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:50.745
I need you to make sure

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:52.545
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:54.745
Sir, is that really a
priority right now?

00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:56.665
Until such time
as the world ends,

00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:58.825
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:01.185
Clear out the tech below.

00:03:01.345 --> 00:03:03.865
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:05.185
Yes, sir.

00:03:05.545 --> 00:03:06.745
With me.

00:03:09.865 --> 00:03:10.865
Talk to me, Doctor.

00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:14.025
Director.

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:15.905
Is there anything
we know for certain?

00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:18.345
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:21.345
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:25.065
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's... behaving.

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:26.465
I assume you pulled the plug.

00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:28.225
She's an energy source.

00:03:28.705 --> 00:03:31.625
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:32.905
If she reaches peak level...

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:36.545
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:37.945
But we don't have the harness.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:39.585
My calculations are
far from complete.

00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:42.545
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:44.385
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

00:03:45.265 --> 00:03:47.145
That can be harmful.

00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:48.825
Where's Agent Barton?

00:03:48.945 --> 00:03:50.705
The Hawk?

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.505
Up in his nest, as usual.

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:56.905
<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>

00:03:57.745 --> 00:03:58.945
<i>I gave you this detail</i>

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:00.745
<i>so you could keep a
close eye on things.</i>

00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:02.225
Well, I see better
from a distance.

00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:04.505
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:07.065
Doctor, it's spiking again.

00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:08.665
No one's come or gone.

00:04:08.745 --> 00:04:10.505
And Selvig's clean.

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:12.545
No contacts, no IMs.

00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:15.225
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

00:04:17.065 --> 00:04:18.465
"At this end"?

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:22.545
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway
to the other end of space, right?

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:25.585
Doors open from both sides.

00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:27.745
Not yet.

00:05:35.665 --> 00:05:38.745
Sir, please put down the spear.

00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:19.225
You have heart.

00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:51.385
Please don't.

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:54.305
I still need that.

00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:56.065
This doesn't have
to get any messier.

00:06:56.145 --> 00:06:57.505
Of course it does.

00:06:57.585 --> 00:06:59.505
I've come too far
for anything else.

00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:04.465
I am Loki, of Asgard,

00:07:04.985 --> 00:07:07.425
and I am burdened
with glorious purpose.

00:07:07.585 --> 00:07:09.065
Loki,

00:07:09.465 --> 00:07:10.825
brother of Thor.

00:07:10.985 --> 00:07:13.425
We have no quarrel
with your people.

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:16.585
An ant has no
quarrel with a boot.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.145
Are you planning to step on us?

00:07:19.225 --> 00:07:22.305
I come with glad tidings

00:07:23.465 --> 00:07:25.425
of a world made free.

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:26.825
Free from what?

00:07:26.985 --> 00:07:28.305
Freedom.

00:07:28.945 --> 00:07:31.545
Freedom is life's great lie.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:35.145
Once you accept that,
in your heart,

00:07:39.705 --> 00:07:41.505
you will know peace.

00:07:41.825 --> 00:07:44.345
Yeah, you say "peace,"

00:07:44.425 --> 00:07:46.505
I kind of think you
mean the other thing.

00:07:47.145 --> 00:07:49.225
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:50.585
This place is about to blow

00:07:50.665 --> 00:07:52.425
and drop a hundred
feet of rock on us.

00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:55.105
He means to bury us.

00:07:55.185 --> 00:07:56.425
Like the pharaohs of old.

00:07:56.505 --> 00:07:58.545
He's right. The portal
is collapsing in on itself.

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:00.865
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:02.225
Well, then.

00:08:17.985 --> 00:08:19.065
I need these vehicles.

00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:25.345
- Who's that?
- They didn't tell me.

00:08:28.465 --> 00:08:29.745
<i>Hill!</i>

00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:31.705
Do you copy?

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:33.505
<i>Barton has turned.</i>

00:08:46.665 --> 00:08:49.425
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

00:09:25.905 --> 00:09:28.065
Okay, let's go.
No, leave it. Go!

00:09:44.465 --> 00:09:46.625
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:20.025
<i>Director?</i>

00:11:20.345 --> 00:11:21.865
Director Fury, do you copy?

00:11:22.025 --> 00:11:24.345
The Tesseract is
with a hostile force.

00:11:24.425 --> 00:11:27.025
I have men down. Hill?

00:11:27.265 --> 00:11:29.185
A lot of men still under.

00:11:29.345 --> 00:11:31.145
I don't know how many survivors.

00:11:31.305 --> 00:11:32.585
<i>Sound a general call.</i>

00:11:32.665 --> 00:11:34.425
I want every living
soul not working rescue

00:11:34.505 --> 00:11:35.505
looking for that briefcase.

00:11:35.705 --> 00:11:36.745
Roger that.

00:11:36.945 --> 00:11:40.265
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.

00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:42.945
<i>As of right now,</i>

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:44.625
we are at war.

00:11:46.265 --> 00:11:47.665
What do we do?

00:13:24.356 --> 00:13:26.218
...you may have
to write it down.

00:13:41.627 --> 00:13:44.254
<i>You're at 1-14
Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.</i>

00:13:44.673 --> 00:13:46.993
<i>We have an F-22
exactly eight miles out.</i>

00:13:47.652 --> 00:13:49.692
<i>Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block</i>

00:13:49.736 --> 00:13:51.816
<i>before you can make the lobby.</i>

00:13:58.372 --> 00:14:00.572
<i>- We need you to come in.</i>
- Are you kidding? I'm working.

00:14:00.732 --> 00:14:02.012
<i>This takes precedence.</i>

00:14:02.172 --> 00:14:03.892
I'm in the middle
of an interrogation.

00:14:04.012 --> 00:14:05.852
This moron is
giving me everything.

00:14:06.172 --> 00:14:08.852
I don't... give everything.

00:14:10.292 --> 00:14:11.732
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

00:14:11.812 --> 00:14:12.812
<i>Natasha,</i>

00:14:14.372 --> 00:14:15.892
Barton's been compromised.

00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:20.972
Let me put you on hold.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:03.570
Where is Barton now?

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.290
<i>- We don't know.</i>
- But he's alive?

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.290
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.530
But first, we need you
to talk to the big guy.

00:15:10.714 --> 00:15:12.410
Coulson, you know
that Stark trusts me

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.850
about as far as he can throw me.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.570
Oh, I've got Stark.
You get the big guy.

00:16:05.788 --> 00:16:07.068
Please.

00:16:34.318 --> 00:16:36.638
You should've got paid
up front, Banner.

00:16:36.838 --> 00:16:38.158
You know, for a man

00:16:38.238 --> 00:16:39.598
who's supposed to
be avoiding stress,

00:16:39.758 --> 00:16:43.078
you picked a hell
of a place to settle.

00:16:44.758 --> 00:16:46.998
Avoiding stress
isn't the secret.

00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:49.718
Then what is it? Yoga?

00:16:50.838 --> 00:16:54.038
You brought me to the
edge of the city. Smart.

00:16:54.598 --> 00:16:58.678
I assume the whole
place is surrounded.

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:00.518
Just you and me.

00:17:01.718 --> 00:17:03.758
And your actress buddy?

00:17:03.918 --> 00:17:05.918
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:07.598
I did.

00:17:07.758 --> 00:17:08.918
Who are you?

00:17:09.078 --> 00:17:10.238
Natasha Romanoff.

00:17:13.518 --> 00:17:14.918
Are you here to
kill me, Ms. Romanoff?

00:17:15.078 --> 00:17:17.798
Because that's not going
to work out for everyone.

00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.478
No, of course not.
I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:17:22.198 --> 00:17:23.758
S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:17:25.438 --> 00:17:26.518
How did they find me?

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:28.278
We never lost you, Doctor.

00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:29.558
We've kept our distance.

00:17:29.718 --> 00:17:31.558
Even helped keep some
other interested parties

00:17:31.638 --> 00:17:32.758
off your scent.

00:17:33.198 --> 00:17:34.238
Why?

00:17:34.318 --> 00:17:36.758
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

00:17:36.918 --> 00:17:38.598
But now we need you to come in.

00:17:39.518 --> 00:17:41.438
What if I say no?

00:17:41.598 --> 00:17:43.758
I'll persuade you.

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:50.238
And what if the
other guy says no?

00:17:50.918 --> 00:17:52.558
You've been more than
a year without an incident.

00:17:52.718 --> 00:17:55.358
I don't think you want
to break that streak.

00:17:57.518 --> 00:18:00.198
Well, I don't every
time get what I want.

00:18:01.158 --> 00:18:02.358
Doctor, we're facing a potential

00:18:02.438 --> 00:18:03.438
global catastrophe.

00:18:04.238 --> 00:18:07.438
Well, those I
actively try to avoid.

00:18:07.678 --> 00:18:09.798
This

00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.398
is the Tesseract.

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:15.398
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

00:18:18.158 --> 00:18:20.358
What does Fury want
me to do, swallow it?

00:18:20.518 --> 00:18:23.038
He wants you to find it.
It's been taken.

00:18:23.838 --> 00:18:25.438
It emits a gamma signature

00:18:25.518 --> 00:18:28.038
that's too weak for us to trace.

00:18:28.198 --> 00:18:31.198
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

00:18:31.358 --> 00:18:34.198
If there was,
that's where I'd be.

00:18:34.718 --> 00:18:36.958
So, Fury isn't
after the monster?

00:18:37.118 --> 00:18:38.398
Not that he's told me.

00:18:38.558 --> 00:18:40.798
And he tells you everything?

00:18:41.398 --> 00:18:43.278
Talk to Fury.
He needs you on this.

00:18:43.358 --> 00:18:44.358
He needs me in a cage?

00:18:44.438 --> 00:18:45.438
No one's going
to put you in a...

00:18:45.518 --> 00:18:46.478
Stop lying to me!

00:18:50.518 --> 00:18:53.158
I'm sorry. That was mean.

00:18:54.038 --> 00:18:56.318
I just wanted to
see what you'd do.

00:18:57.438 --> 00:19:00.478
Why don't we do
this the easy way

00:19:00.638 --> 00:19:01.878
where you don't use that

00:19:02.038 --> 00:19:06.078
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

00:19:06.758 --> 00:19:08.158
Okay?

00:19:09.078 --> 00:19:10.478
Natasha?

00:19:16.078 --> 00:19:17.198
Stand down.

00:19:18.078 --> 00:19:19.678
<i>We're good here.</i>

00:19:21.398 --> 00:19:23.078
"Just you and me."

00:19:25.198 --> 00:19:27.838
<i>This is out of line, Director.</i>

00:19:27.998 --> 00:19:30.398
<i>You're dealing with
forces you can't control.</i>

00:19:30.838 --> 00:19:34.278
You ever been in a war, Councilman?
In a firefight?

00:19:34.478 --> 00:19:37.278
Did you feel an
overabundance of control?

00:19:37.478 --> 00:19:39.558
<i>You're saying that this Asgard</i>

00:19:39.638 --> 00:19:40.878
<i>is declaring war on our planet?</i>

00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.638
Not Asgard. Loki.

00:19:43.798 --> 00:19:46.678
<i>He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?</i>

00:19:46.838 --> 00:19:47.838
<i>His brother.</i>

00:19:47.918 --> 00:19:49.998
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile,

00:19:50.158 --> 00:19:51.198
but he's worlds away.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.158
We can't depend
on him to help, either.

00:19:53.278 --> 00:19:54.278
It's up to us.

00:19:54.358 --> 00:19:56.998
<i>Which is why you should
be focusing on Phase 2.</i>

00:19:57.158 --> 00:19:58.518
<i>It was designed
for exactly this...</i>

00:19:58.678 --> 00:20:01.558
Phase 2 isn't ready.
Our enemy is.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.718
We need a response team.

00:20:03.878 --> 00:20:05.958
<i>The Avengers
Initiative was shut down.</i>

00:20:06.358 --> 00:20:08.158
This isn't about the Avengers.

00:20:08.318 --> 00:20:09.518
<i>We've seen the list.</i>

00:20:09.678 --> 00:20:10.678
<i>You're running
the world's greatest</i>

00:20:10.798 --> 00:20:11.958
<i>covert security network,</i>

00:20:12.038 --> 00:20:13.718
<i>and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race</i>

00:20:13.798 --> 00:20:15.078
<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>

00:20:15.158 --> 00:20:17.118
I'm not leaving
anything to anyone.

00:20:17.278 --> 00:20:19.638
We need a response team.

00:20:19.798 --> 00:20:22.558
These people may be
isolated, unbalanced even,

00:20:22.718 --> 00:20:24.238
but I believe
with the right push

00:20:24.318 --> 00:20:26.638
they can be exactly
what we need.

00:20:27.158 --> 00:20:28.518
<i>You believe?</i>

00:20:28.678 --> 00:20:32.078
<i>War isn't won by
sentiment, Director.</i>

00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:36.358
No, it's won by soldiers.

00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:57.798
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

00:20:57.958 --> 00:20:59.518
<i>I got to put her in the water!</i>

00:21:04.838 --> 00:21:05.998
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

00:21:06.518 --> 00:21:07.998
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

00:21:08.478 --> 00:21:09.678
<i>This guy is still alive!</i>

00:21:34.358 --> 00:21:36.198
Trouble sleeping?

00:21:37.518 --> 00:21:40.198
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:45.678
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:54.358
When I went under,
the world was at war.

00:21:54.518 --> 00:21:56.398
I wake up, they say we won.

00:21:57.078 --> 00:21:58.638
They didn't say what we lost.

00:21:59.198 --> 00:22:01.558
We've made some
mistakes along the way.

00:22:01.918 --> 00:22:03.638
Some, very recently.

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:06.398
Are you here
with a mission, sir?

00:22:06.478 --> 00:22:07.478
I am.

00:22:07.558 --> 00:22:09.318
Trying to get me
back in the world?

00:22:09.758 --> 00:22:11.478
Trying to save it.

00:22:16.078 --> 00:22:18.158
HYDRA's secret weapon.

00:22:18.318 --> 00:22:20.438
Howard Stark fished
that out of the ocean

00:22:20.558 --> 00:22:21.718
when he was looking for you.

00:22:22.198 --> 00:22:23.918
He thought what we think.

00:22:24.078 --> 00:22:25.918
The Tesseract could be the key

00:22:25.998 --> 00:22:28.318
to unlimited sustainable energy.

00:22:28.718 --> 00:22:32.598
That's something the
world sorely needs.

00:22:34.078 --> 00:22:35.278
Who took it from you?

00:22:35.438 --> 00:22:36.878
He's called Loki.

00:22:37.078 --> 00:22:39.758
He's not from around here.

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:42.278
There's a lot we'll have
to bring you up to speed on

00:22:42.358 --> 00:22:43.598
if you're in.

00:22:44.478 --> 00:22:46.558
The world has
gotten even stranger

00:22:46.638 --> 00:22:48.078
than you already know.

00:22:48.238 --> 00:22:50.878
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

00:22:51.438 --> 00:22:53.118
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

00:22:54.878 --> 00:22:56.278
There's a debriefing packet

00:22:56.358 --> 00:22:58.798
waiting for you back
at your apartment.

00:23:01.118 --> 00:23:03.078
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

00:23:03.158 --> 00:23:04.438
that we ought to know now?

00:23:04.678 --> 00:23:06.998
You should have
left it in the ocean.

00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:42.638
Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.

00:23:42.798 --> 00:23:44.158
<i>You disconnected
the transmission lines?</i>

00:23:44.238 --> 00:23:45.278
<i>Are we off the grid?</i>

00:23:45.398 --> 00:23:47.598
Stark Tower is about
to become a beacon

00:23:47.678 --> 00:23:49.198
of self-sustaining clean energy.

00:23:49.318 --> 00:23:51.398
<i>Well, assuming the
arc reactor takes over</i>

00:23:51.478 --> 00:23:52.718
<i>and it actually works.</i>

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:54.358
I assume.

00:23:54.878 --> 00:23:55.878
Light her up.

00:24:01.398 --> 00:24:02.398
<i>How does it look?</i>

00:24:02.558 --> 00:24:05.278
Like Christmas,
but with more me.

00:24:05.438 --> 00:24:07.238
<i>We've got to go wider on the
public awareness campaign.</i>

00:24:07.398 --> 00:24:08.478
<i>You need to do some press.</i>

00:24:09.038 --> 00:24:10.118
<i>I'm in DC tomorrow,</i>

00:24:10.198 --> 00:24:11.838
<i>I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.</i>

00:24:11.918 --> 00:24:14.158
Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?

00:24:14.318 --> 00:24:15.398
Enjoy the moment.

00:24:15.598 --> 00:24:16.798
<i>Get in here and I will.</i>

00:24:20.078 --> 00:24:23.438
<i>Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D.
is on the line.</i>

00:24:23.558 --> 00:24:24.638
I'm not in.

00:24:25.198 --> 00:24:26.598
I'm actually out.

00:24:33.718 --> 00:24:36.438
<i>Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.</i>

00:24:36.598 --> 00:24:39.398
Grow a spine, Jarvis.
I got a date.

00:24:43.918 --> 00:24:46.918
Levels are holding
steady, I think.

00:24:47.078 --> 00:24:49.238
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

00:24:49.398 --> 00:24:50.638
Which brings me
to my next question.

00:24:50.718 --> 00:24:52.798
How does it feel to be a genius?

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:55.238
Well, I really wouldn't
know, now would I?

00:24:55.398 --> 00:24:59.918
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

00:25:00.078 --> 00:25:03.758
No, all this came from that.

00:25:03.918 --> 00:25:06.238
Give yourself
some credit. Please.

00:25:06.398 --> 00:25:08.238
Stark Tower is your baby.

00:25:08.438 --> 00:25:10.918
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

00:25:11.278 --> 00:25:12.438
12%?

00:25:12.558 --> 00:25:13.718
An argument can be made for 15.

00:25:13.798 --> 00:25:15.438
12%? My baby?

00:25:15.598 --> 00:25:17.238
Well, I did do all
the heavy lifting.

00:25:17.318 --> 00:25:19.278
Literally, I lifted
the heavy things.

00:25:19.438 --> 00:25:21.718
And, sorry, but
the security snafu?

00:25:21.798 --> 00:25:23.318
- That was on you.
- Oh.

00:25:23.438 --> 00:25:25.558
- My private elevator...
- You mean our elevator?

00:25:25.718 --> 00:25:28.438
...it was teeming
with sweaty workmen.

00:25:28.598 --> 00:25:30.998
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

00:25:31.158 --> 00:25:33.158
in some subtle
way later, aren't I?

00:25:33.558 --> 00:25:34.838
It's not going
to be that subtle.

00:25:34.998 --> 00:25:36.278
I'll tell you what.

00:25:36.438 --> 00:25:38.998
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

00:25:39.158 --> 00:25:40.558
On the lease.

00:25:41.438 --> 00:25:43.638
Call your mom.
Can you bunk over?

00:25:43.798 --> 00:25:45.078
<i>Sir, the telephone.</i>

00:25:45.238 --> 00:25:47.678
<i>I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.</i>

00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:49.838
<i>Mr. Stark, we need to talk.</i>

00:25:50.078 --> 00:25:52.478
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

00:25:52.638 --> 00:25:54.678
- Please leave a message.
<i>- This is urgent.</i>

00:25:54.838 --> 00:25:56.638
Then leave it urgently.

00:25:58.158 --> 00:25:59.358
Security breach. It's on you.

00:25:59.518 --> 00:26:02.278
- Mr. Stark.
- Phil! Come in.

00:26:02.438 --> 00:26:03.438
"Phil"?

00:26:03.518 --> 00:26:04.598
I can't stay.

00:26:04.758 --> 00:26:05.998
His first name is "Agent."

00:26:06.158 --> 00:26:07.838
Come on in. We're celebrating.

00:26:08.038 --> 00:26:09.838
Which is why he can't stay.

00:26:10.038 --> 00:26:12.038
We need you to look this
over as soon as possible.

00:26:12.198 --> 00:26:13.278
I don't like being
handed things.

00:26:13.438 --> 00:26:14.958
That's fine, because I
love to be handed things.

00:26:15.118 --> 00:26:16.398
So, let's trade.

00:26:17.838 --> 00:26:19.318
Thank you.

00:26:20.478 --> 00:26:22.758
Official consulting hours
are between 8 and 5

00:26:22.838 --> 00:26:23.838
every other Thursday.

00:26:24.038 --> 00:26:25.038
This isn't a consultation.

00:26:25.158 --> 00:26:26.478
Is this about the Avengers?

00:26:26.838 --> 00:26:28.718
Which I know nothing about.

00:26:28.878 --> 00:26:31.478
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

00:26:31.638 --> 00:26:32.998
And I didn't even qualify.

00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:34.158
I didn't know that either.

00:26:34.358 --> 00:26:37.278
Apparently I'm
volatile, self-obsessed,

00:26:37.358 --> 00:26:38.678
don't play well with others.

00:26:38.918 --> 00:26:39.918
That I did know.

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:41.718
This isn't about
personality profiles anymore.

00:26:41.838 --> 00:26:44.238
Whatever.
Ms. Potts, got a second?

00:26:44.398 --> 00:26:45.398
Half a mo.

00:26:50.678 --> 00:26:53.078
You know, I thought we
were having a moment.

00:26:53.238 --> 00:26:54.878
I was having 12% of a moment.

00:26:56.038 --> 00:26:58.518
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

00:26:58.718 --> 00:27:00.718
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

00:27:00.878 --> 00:27:02.678
What is all this?

00:27:02.838 --> 00:27:04.478
This is

00:27:05.038 --> 00:27:06.038
this.

00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:14.838
I'm going to take
the jet to DC tonight.

00:27:14.918 --> 00:27:15.998
Tomorrow.

00:27:16.078 --> 00:27:18.438
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

00:27:18.598 --> 00:27:20.358
Well, what if I didn't?

00:27:20.918 --> 00:27:22.358
- If you didn't?
- Yeah.

00:27:22.518 --> 00:27:24.718
You mean when you've finished?

00:27:25.758 --> 00:27:29.078
Well, um, then...

00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:35.558
Square deal. Fly safe.

00:27:39.758 --> 00:27:40.918
Work hard.

00:27:43.758 --> 00:27:45.598
So, any chance you're
driving by LaGuardia?

00:27:45.758 --> 00:27:48.478
- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.

00:27:48.598 --> 00:27:49.638
I want to hear

00:27:49.758 --> 00:27:51.438
about the cellist.
Is that still a thing?

00:27:51.598 --> 00:27:52.798
She moved back to Portland.

00:27:52.958 --> 00:27:56.078
What? Boo!

00:28:04.078 --> 00:28:06.598
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

00:28:10.278 --> 00:28:11.918
So, this Dr. Banner was trying

00:28:11.998 --> 00:28:13.958
to replicate the serum
they used on me?

00:28:14.118 --> 00:28:15.718
A lot of people were.

00:28:15.918 --> 00:28:17.558
You were the
world's first superhero.

00:28:18.238 --> 00:28:19.518
Banner thought gamma radiation

00:28:19.598 --> 00:28:20.998
might hold the key to unlocking

00:28:21.118 --> 00:28:22.438
Erskine's original formula.

00:28:23.438 --> 00:28:24.918
Didn't really go
his way, did it?

00:28:25.278 --> 00:28:26.798
Not so much.

00:28:26.958 --> 00:28:28.078
When he's not
that thing, though,

00:28:28.158 --> 00:28:29.798
the guy's like a
Stephen Hawking.

00:28:31.838 --> 00:28:34.398
He's like a smart person.

00:28:36.478 --> 00:28:37.678
I gotta say,

00:28:37.958 --> 00:28:40.438
it's an honor to
meet you officially.

00:28:41.118 --> 00:28:42.678
I've sort of met you. I mean,

00:28:42.798 --> 00:28:44.638
I watched you while
you were sleeping.

00:28:46.438 --> 00:28:48.678
I mean, I was present

00:28:48.798 --> 00:28:52.198
while you were
unconscious from the ice.

00:28:52.318 --> 00:28:54.638
You know, it's really
just a huge honor

00:28:54.758 --> 00:28:56.758
to have you on board this...

00:28:57.118 --> 00:28:58.998
I hope I'm the man for the job.

00:28:59.158 --> 00:29:02.118
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

00:29:02.278 --> 00:29:05.198
We made some
modifications to the uniform.

00:29:05.358 --> 00:29:06.918
I had a little design input.

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:08.358
The uniform?

00:29:08.558 --> 00:29:11.078
Aren't the stars
and stripes a little

00:29:12.158 --> 00:29:13.598
old-fashioned?

00:29:14.318 --> 00:29:16.598
With everything
that's happening,

00:29:16.758 --> 00:29:18.438
and the things that are
about to come to light,

00:29:19.238 --> 00:29:22.758
people might just need
a little old-fashioned.

00:29:55.238 --> 00:29:58.238
The Chitauri grow restless.

00:29:58.438 --> 00:30:00.158
Let them gird themselves.

00:30:00.238 --> 00:30:02.078
I will lead them in
the glorious battle.

00:30:02.238 --> 00:30:03.478
Battle?

00:30:04.238 --> 00:30:07.398
Against the meager
might of Earth?

00:30:07.558 --> 00:30:10.398
Glorious, not lengthy.

00:30:10.558 --> 00:30:14.438
If your force is as
formidable as you claim.

00:30:14.598 --> 00:30:17.158
You question us?

00:30:17.318 --> 00:30:19.478
You question him,

00:30:19.558 --> 00:30:21.398
he who put the
scepter in your hand?

00:30:22.238 --> 00:30:25.238
Who gave you ancient
knowledge and new purpose

00:30:25.398 --> 00:30:27.878
when you were
cast out, defeated?

00:30:28.478 --> 00:30:30.398
I was a king!

00:30:30.558 --> 00:30:32.838
The rightful king of Asgard,

00:30:33.238 --> 00:30:34.278
betrayed.

00:30:34.918 --> 00:30:37.638
Your ambition is little

00:30:37.918 --> 00:30:40.678
and born of childish need.

00:30:40.758 --> 00:30:42.758
We look beyond the Earth

00:30:42.918 --> 00:30:45.958
to the greater worlds
the Tesseract will unveil.

00:30:46.398 --> 00:30:47.838
You don't have
the Tesseract yet.

00:30:50.598 --> 00:30:51.598
I don't threaten.

00:30:53.158 --> 00:30:55.758
But until I open the doors,

00:30:55.918 --> 00:30:59.598
until your force is
mine to command,

00:31:00.278 --> 00:31:02.118
you are but words.

00:31:02.278 --> 00:31:06.278
You will have your
war, Asgardian.

00:31:08.078 --> 00:31:10.118
If you fail,

00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:15.518
if the Tesseract
is kept from us,

00:31:15.678 --> 00:31:20.078
there will be no
realm, no barren moon,

00:31:20.238 --> 00:31:23.598
no crevice where
he cannot find you.

00:31:25.118 --> 00:31:27.918
You think you know pain?

00:31:28.078 --> 00:31:30.158
He will make you long

00:31:30.318 --> 00:31:33.798
for something sweet as pain.

00:32:02.958 --> 00:32:03.998
Stow the captain's gear.

00:32:04.118 --> 00:32:05.158
Yes, sir.

00:32:06.678 --> 00:32:09.838
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

00:32:09.998 --> 00:32:11.358
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

00:32:11.518 --> 00:32:12.518
They need you on the bridge.

00:32:12.598 --> 00:32:14.158
They're starting the face-trace.

00:32:14.318 --> 00:32:15.438
See you there.

00:32:17.158 --> 00:32:21.358
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

00:32:21.518 --> 00:32:24.198
I thought Coulson
was gonna swoon.

00:32:24.358 --> 00:32:25.438
Did he ask you to sign

00:32:25.518 --> 00:32:27.278
his Captain America
trading cards yet?

00:32:27.438 --> 00:32:28.678
Trading cards?

00:32:28.878 --> 00:32:31.078
They're vintage.
He's very proud.

00:32:32.798 --> 00:32:34.118
Dr. Banner.

00:32:36.038 --> 00:32:37.358
Yeah, hi.

00:32:37.878 --> 00:32:39.158
They told me you
would be coming.

00:32:39.318 --> 00:32:40.718
Word is, you can find the Cube.

00:32:41.678 --> 00:32:43.598
Is that the only word on me?

00:32:43.958 --> 00:32:45.158
Only word I care about.

00:32:47.718 --> 00:32:50.398
It must be strange
for you, all of this.

00:32:50.998 --> 00:32:53.718
Well, this is actually
kind of familiar.

00:32:53.878 --> 00:32:56.518
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

00:32:56.678 --> 00:32:59.478
It's going to get a
little hard to breathe.

00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:02.318
<i>Flight crew, secure the deck.</i>

00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:08.358
Is this a submarine?

00:33:08.918 --> 00:33:09.918
Really?

00:33:09.998 --> 00:33:13.798
They want me in a submerged,
pressurized, metal container?

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:42.558
No, no, this is much worse.

00:34:12.318 --> 00:34:15.038
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

00:34:15.198 --> 00:34:17.718
Increase collective to 8.0%.

00:34:22.718 --> 00:34:25.078
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

00:34:25.158 --> 00:34:26.678
Increase output to capacity.

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:28.998
Power plant
performing at capacity.

00:34:29.158 --> 00:34:30.638
We are clear.

00:34:30.798 --> 00:34:32.358
All engines operating.

00:34:32.518 --> 00:34:37.198
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

00:34:37.398 --> 00:34:39.998
- We are at level, sir.
- Good.

00:34:40.358 --> 00:34:41.358
Let's vanish.

00:34:41.518 --> 00:34:43.998
Engage retro-reflection panels.

00:34:59.718 --> 00:35:00.958
Reflection panels engaged.

00:35:01.518 --> 00:35:02.918
Gentlemen.

00:35:15.238 --> 00:35:16.398
Doctor, thank you for coming.

00:35:18.358 --> 00:35:20.278
Thanks for asking nicely.

00:35:20.438 --> 00:35:23.118
So, how long am I staying?

00:35:23.278 --> 00:35:25.198
Once we get our hands
on the Tesseract,

00:35:25.278 --> 00:35:26.398
you're in the wind.

00:35:26.558 --> 00:35:28.398
Where are you with that?

00:35:28.598 --> 00:35:30.398
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible

00:35:30.558 --> 00:35:31.558
camera on the planet.

00:35:32.038 --> 00:35:33.918
Cell phones, laptops...

00:35:34.398 --> 00:35:36.078
If it's connected
to a satellite,

00:35:36.358 --> 00:35:37.798
it's eyes and ears for us.

00:35:37.878 --> 00:35:39.198
That's still not gonna
find them in time.

00:35:39.398 --> 00:35:40.398
You have to narrow your field.

00:35:40.558 --> 00:35:42.558
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

00:35:42.718 --> 00:35:44.398
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.

00:35:44.558 --> 00:35:46.318
Tell them to put the
spectrometers on the roof

00:35:46.398 --> 00:35:47.878
and calibrate them
for gamma rays.

00:35:48.078 --> 00:35:49.758
I'll rough out a
tracking algorithm,

00:35:49.918 --> 00:35:51.358
basic cluster recognition.

00:35:51.558 --> 00:35:54.078
At least we could
rule out a few places.

00:35:54.238 --> 00:35:56.078
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

00:35:56.278 --> 00:35:57.438
Agent Romanoff,

00:35:57.558 --> 00:35:59.918
could you show Dr. Banner
to his laboratory, please?

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:03.278
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

00:36:03.758 --> 00:36:05.598
Put it over there.

00:36:07.518 --> 00:36:09.718
Where did you find
all these people?

00:36:09.878 --> 00:36:12.878
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no
shortage of enemies, Doctor.

00:36:13.278 --> 00:36:14.438
Is this the stuff you need?

00:36:14.598 --> 00:36:15.598
Yeah, iridium.

00:36:15.718 --> 00:36:18.398
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

00:36:18.558 --> 00:36:20.238
It's very hard to get hold of.

00:36:20.398 --> 00:36:21.958
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
knows you need it.

00:36:22.158 --> 00:36:23.558
Well, I didn't know.

00:36:23.718 --> 00:36:24.958
Hey!

00:36:25.158 --> 00:36:27.478
The Tesseract has
shown me so much.

00:36:27.878 --> 00:36:29.838
It's more than knowledge.
It's truth.

00:36:29.918 --> 00:36:30.958
I know.

00:36:31.758 --> 00:36:33.718
What did it show you,
Agent Barton?

00:36:34.638 --> 00:36:36.118
My next target.

00:36:36.278 --> 00:36:37.278
Tell me what you need.

00:36:40.718 --> 00:36:42.598
I need a distraction.

00:36:43.478 --> 00:36:44.958
And an eyeball.

00:36:51.798 --> 00:36:54.318
I mean, if it's not
too much trouble.

00:36:54.398 --> 00:36:55.518
No, no. It's fine.

00:36:58.518 --> 00:37:00.118
It's a vintage set.

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:02.638
It took me a couple of
years to collect them all.

00:37:05.118 --> 00:37:06.278
Near mint.

00:37:06.438 --> 00:37:07.838
Slight foxing around
the edges, but...

00:37:07.998 --> 00:37:10.678
We got a hit.
A 67% match.

00:37:11.158 --> 00:37:12.798
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

00:37:13.798 --> 00:37:14.798
Location?

00:37:14.958 --> 00:37:18.038
Stuttgart, Germany.
28 Konigstrasse.

00:37:18.198 --> 00:37:19.478
He's not exactly hiding.

00:37:19.638 --> 00:37:20.838
Captain,

00:37:21.198 --> 00:37:22.198
you're up.

00:39:57.638 --> 00:39:58.798
Kneel before me.

00:40:03.238 --> 00:40:04.558
I said

00:40:06.598 --> 00:40:08.838
kneel!

00:40:18.078 --> 00:40:21.518
Is not this simpler?

00:40:22.998 --> 00:40:26.238
Is this not your natural state?

00:40:28.518 --> 00:40:31.758
It's the unspoken
truth of humanity,

00:40:31.918 --> 00:40:34.358
that you crave subjugation.

00:40:34.838 --> 00:40:38.678
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

00:40:38.838 --> 00:40:41.518
in a mad scramble for power,

00:40:43.278 --> 00:40:44.678
for identity.

00:40:46.318 --> 00:40:49.678
You were made to be ruled.

00:40:50.278 --> 00:40:51.958
In the end,

00:40:52.198 --> 00:40:54.518
you will always kneel.

00:41:01.878 --> 00:41:03.878
Not to men like you.

00:41:04.878 --> 00:41:06.798
There are no men like me.

00:41:07.638 --> 00:41:10.558
There are always men like you.

00:41:11.798 --> 00:41:13.718
Look to your elder, people.

00:41:15.838 --> 00:41:17.318
Let him be an example.

00:41:24.078 --> 00:41:26.678
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

00:41:26.878 --> 00:41:30.078
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

00:41:30.238 --> 00:41:31.758
we ended up disagreeing.

00:41:31.918 --> 00:41:33.918
The soldier.

00:41:35.918 --> 00:41:37.198
The man out of time.

00:41:37.758 --> 00:41:39.078
I'm not the one
who's out of time.

00:41:42.478 --> 00:41:45.078
<i>Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.</i>

00:42:05.438 --> 00:42:07.038
Kneel.

00:42:07.118 --> 00:42:08.558
Not today!

00:42:10.598 --> 00:42:11.958
The guy's all over the place.

00:42:15.398 --> 00:42:17.798
<i>Agent Romanoff.
You miss me?</i>

00:42:34.478 --> 00:42:36.638
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

00:42:44.638 --> 00:42:46.158
Good move.

00:42:47.558 --> 00:42:48.878
Mr. Stark.

00:42:49.518 --> 00:42:50.718
Captain.

00:42:57.918 --> 00:42:59.598
<i>Is he saying anything?</i>

00:42:59.758 --> 00:43:01.038
Not a word.

00:43:01.278 --> 00:43:03.238
<i>Just get him here.
We're low on time.</i>

00:43:06.278 --> 00:43:07.278
I don't like it.

00:43:07.678 --> 00:43:09.638
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

00:43:09.838 --> 00:43:11.558
I don't remember
it being that easy.

00:43:11.678 --> 00:43:13.118
This guy packs a wallop.

00:43:13.278 --> 00:43:16.918
Still, you are pretty
spry for an older fellow.

00:43:17.918 --> 00:43:19.558
What's your thing, Pilates?

00:43:19.718 --> 00:43:20.718
What?

00:43:20.878 --> 00:43:21.918
It's like calisthenics.

00:43:21.998 --> 00:43:24.078
You might have
missed a couple of things

00:43:24.238 --> 00:43:25.878
doing time as a Capsicle.

00:43:27.758 --> 00:43:29.398
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

00:43:29.558 --> 00:43:32.478
Yeah, there's a lot of
things Fury doesn't tell you.

00:43:32.798 --> 00:43:34.438
Where's this coming from?

00:43:38.478 --> 00:43:41.118
What's the matter?
Are you scared of a little lightning?

00:43:41.478 --> 00:43:43.878
I'm not overly fond
of what follows.

00:44:01.598 --> 00:44:02.798
What are you doing?

00:44:16.078 --> 00:44:17.318
And now there's that guy.

00:44:17.398 --> 00:44:19.198
Another Asgardian?

00:44:19.358 --> 00:44:21.238
- That guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.

00:44:21.398 --> 00:44:24.038
If he frees Loki or kills
him, the Tesseract's lost.

00:44:24.198 --> 00:44:26.078
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

00:44:26.238 --> 00:44:28.598
I have a plan. Attack.

00:44:34.598 --> 00:44:36.398
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

00:44:36.558 --> 00:44:38.038
I don't see how I can.

00:44:38.118 --> 00:44:40.438
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

00:44:40.838 --> 00:44:42.158
There's only one God, ma'am.

00:44:42.278 --> 00:44:44.678
And I'm pretty sure he
doesn't dress like that.

00:45:00.118 --> 00:45:01.518
Where is the Tesseract?

00:45:01.678 --> 00:45:03.038
I missed you, too.

00:45:03.558 --> 00:45:04.918
Do I look to be in
a gaming mood?

00:45:05.598 --> 00:45:06.998
You should thank me.

00:45:07.398 --> 00:45:09.518
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

00:45:09.758 --> 00:45:11.958
did the Allfather have to
muster to conjure you here

00:45:12.638 --> 00:45:14.038
to your precious Earth?

00:45:18.118 --> 00:45:19.478
I thought you dead.

00:45:21.038 --> 00:45:22.518
Did you mourn?

00:45:22.918 --> 00:45:24.758
We all did. Our father...

00:45:25.038 --> 00:45:27.998
Your father.

00:45:29.838 --> 00:45:32.758
He did tell you my true
parentage, did he not?

00:45:35.278 --> 00:45:37.558
We were raised together.

00:45:37.718 --> 00:45:40.398
We played together,
we fought together.

00:45:40.878 --> 00:45:42.118
Do you remember none of that?

00:45:42.278 --> 00:45:44.278
I remember a shadow.

00:45:45.758 --> 00:45:48.838
Living in the shade
of your greatness.

00:45:49.518 --> 00:45:52.158
I remember you
tossing me into an abyss.

00:45:52.238 --> 00:45:54.278
I, who was, and should be, king!

00:45:54.478 --> 00:45:56.598
So you take the world
I love as a recompense

00:45:56.678 --> 00:45:58.558
for your imagined slights?

00:45:58.718 --> 00:46:01.838
No. The Earth is
under my protection, Loki.

00:46:03.198 --> 00:46:06.798
And you're doing a
marvelous job with that.

00:46:07.238 --> 00:46:09.238
The humans slaughter
each other in droves

00:46:09.318 --> 00:46:11.158
while you idly fret.

00:46:11.318 --> 00:46:13.518
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

00:46:13.678 --> 00:46:15.238
You think yourself above them?

00:46:16.358 --> 00:46:17.358
Well, yes.

00:46:17.518 --> 00:46:20.038
Then you miss the
truth of ruling, brother.

00:46:20.798 --> 00:46:22.238
A throne would suit you ill.

00:46:27.398 --> 00:46:30.198
I've seen worlds you've
never known about!

00:46:30.358 --> 00:46:34.598
I have grown,
Odinson, in my exile.

00:46:34.918 --> 00:46:36.918
I have seen the true
power of the Tesseract,

00:46:36.998 --> 00:46:38.118
and when I wield it...

00:46:38.278 --> 00:46:40.078
Who showed you this power?

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:42.598
Who controls the would-be king?

00:46:42.758 --> 00:46:44.598
- I am a king!
- Not here!

00:46:44.758 --> 00:46:46.078
You give up the Tesseract!

00:46:46.158 --> 00:46:48.758
You give up this
poisonous dream!

00:46:51.438 --> 00:46:52.838
You come home.

00:46:57.758 --> 00:46:58.958
I don't have it.

00:47:00.998 --> 00:47:02.798
You need the Cube
to bring me home.

00:47:02.918 --> 00:47:05.278
But I've sent it off,
I know not where.

00:47:06.358 --> 00:47:08.238
You listen well, brother.

00:47:10.158 --> 00:47:11.398
I'm listening.

00:47:20.518 --> 00:47:22.198
Do not touch me again.

00:47:22.398 --> 00:47:23.998
Then don't take my stuff.

00:47:24.158 --> 00:47:26.478
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:29.278
Shakespeare in the Park?

00:47:30.678 --> 00:47:33.838
Doth Mother know you
wear-eth her drapes?

00:47:34.078 --> 00:47:36.838
This is beyond you, metal man.

00:47:37.038 --> 00:47:39.118
Loki will face
Asgardian justice.

00:47:39.358 --> 00:47:42.798
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours. Until then,

00:47:43.118 --> 00:47:44.398
stay out of the way.

00:47:45.918 --> 00:47:47.558
Tourist.

00:47:52.878 --> 00:47:53.958
Okay.

00:48:23.678 --> 00:48:26.638
<i>Power at 400% capacity.</i>

00:48:26.838 --> 00:48:28.398
How about that?

00:49:28.678 --> 00:49:29.918
Hey!

00:49:32.438 --> 00:49:33.718
That's enough.

00:49:37.558 --> 00:49:39.278
Now, I don't know what
you plan on doing here.

00:49:39.438 --> 00:49:41.758
I've come here to put
an end to Loki's schemes.

00:49:41.918 --> 00:49:44.518
Then prove it.
Put that hammer down.

00:49:44.678 --> 00:49:45.718
Yeah... No.

00:49:45.918 --> 00:49:47.358
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

00:49:48.918 --> 00:49:51.238
You want me to put
the hammer down?

00:50:18.518 --> 00:50:20.238
Are we done, here?
