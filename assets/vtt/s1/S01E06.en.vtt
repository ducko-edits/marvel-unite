00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:13.414
<i>There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred</i>

00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:14.894
<i>on the freeway
and the rooftop...</i>

00:00:14.974 --> 00:00:18.054
<i>Sorry, Mr. Stark, do you
honestly expect us to believe that</i>

00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:20.000
<i>that was a
bodyguard in a suit...</i>

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:23.579
<i>It is one thing to question the
official story, and another thing entirely</i>

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.899
<i>to make wild accusations, or
insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.699
<i>I mean, let's face it,
I'm not the heroic type.</i>

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.499
<i>A laundry list of
character defects,</i>

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.379
<i>all the mistakes I've
made, largely public.</i>

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:40.059
<i>The truth is</i>

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:46.379
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:05.619
Vanya.

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:59.959
The notary's here!

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.239
Can you please come
sign the transfer paperwork?

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.239
I'm on happy time.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.639
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:12.719
It's called mixed martial arts.

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.199
It's been around
for three weeks.

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:16.359
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.919
All right, put them up. Come on.

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:26.439
I promise you this is the only time I
will ask you to sign over your company.

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:29.999
I need you to initial each box.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.759
Lesson one.
Never take your eye off...

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:36.839
That's it. I'm done.

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:37.919
What's your name, lady?

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:39.399
Rushman.
Natalie Rushman.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.039
Front and center.
Come into the church.

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:42.759
No. You're seriously
not gonna ask...

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:44.879
If it pleases the court,
which it does.

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:45.959
It's no problem.

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:48.359
I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.039
What?

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.119
Can you give her a lesson?

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.639
No problem.

00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:10.799
Pepper.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.039
What?

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:13.959
Who is she?

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.199
She is from legal.

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:19.399
And she is potentially a very
expensive sexual harassment lawsuit

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:20.479
if you keep
ogling her like that.

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:21.639
I need a new assistant, boss.

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.519
Yes, and I've got three
excellent potential candidates.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.159
They're lined up and
ready to meet you.

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:29.119
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now. I feel like it's her.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.279
No, it's not.

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:32.159
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:35.239
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp?
Crunch? Something like that?

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:37.919
How do I spell
your name, Natalie?

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.999
R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.319
What, are you gonna
google her now?

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:44.479
Hmm? I thought I was ogling her.

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:46.839
Oh, wow.
Very, very impressive individual.

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.279
You're so predictable,
you know that?

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:50.479
She's fluent in French,
Italian, Russian, Latin.

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:52.479
- Who speaks Latin?
- No one speaks Latin.

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:53.559
It's a dead language.

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:54.839
No one speaks Latin?

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.759
You can read Latin
or you can write Latin,

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.439
- but you can't speak Latin...
- Did you model in Tokyo?

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:00.239
- 'Cause she modeled in Tokyo.
- Well...

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:01.679
I need her.
She's got everything that I need.

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.999
Rule number one, never take
your eye off your opponent.

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.079
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.639
Happy!

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.679
- That's what I'm talking about.
- I just slipped.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:14.759
- You did?
- Yeah.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.039
Looks like a TKO to me.

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:21.439
Just... I need your impression.

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:24.199
You have a quiet reserve.
I don't know, you have an old soul.

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:25.759
I meant your fingerprint.

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:26.879
Right.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.679
So, how are we doing?

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.159
Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:36.239
You're the boss.

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.679
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.719
- No.
- Yes, that will be all, Ms. Rushman.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.639
Thank you very much.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.319
- I want one.
- No.

00:07:56.764 --> 00:07:59.204
You know, it's Europe.
Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,

00:07:59.284 --> 00:08:00.524
- just go with it.
- Go with it? Go with what?

00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:02.164
- Mr. Stark?
- Hey.

00:08:02.244 --> 00:08:03.404
Hello. How was your flight?

00:08:03.484 --> 00:08:05.044
It was excellent.
Boy, it's nice to see you.

00:08:05.124 --> 00:08:08.044
We have one photographer
from the ACM, if you don't mind.

00:08:08.124 --> 00:08:09.244
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

00:08:09.324 --> 00:08:10.324
When did this happen?

00:08:10.404 --> 00:08:11.404
What? You made me do it.

00:08:11.484 --> 00:08:12.484
I made you do what?

00:08:12.604 --> 00:08:14.044
You quit. Smile.
Look right there.

00:08:14.124 --> 00:08:15.244
Stop acting constipated.

00:08:15.324 --> 00:08:16.844
- Don't flare your nostrils.
- You are so predictable.

00:08:16.924 --> 00:08:18.244
- That's the amazing thing.
- Right this way.

00:08:18.324 --> 00:08:19.724
- You look fantastic.
- Why, thank you very much.

00:08:19.804 --> 00:08:21.684
But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?

00:08:21.764 --> 00:08:23.684
You have a 9:30 dinner.

00:08:23.764 --> 00:08:25.404
- Perfect. I'll be there at 11:00.
- Absolutely.

00:08:25.484 --> 00:08:27.404
- Is this us?
- It can be.

00:08:27.484 --> 00:08:29.164
- Great. Make it us.
- Okay.

00:08:29.284 --> 00:08:30.604
Mr. Musk. How are you?

00:08:30.684 --> 00:08:31.724
Hi, Pepper.

00:08:31.804 --> 00:08:33.684
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

00:08:33.764 --> 00:08:36.044
Elon, how's it going?
Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

00:08:36.124 --> 00:08:38.084
Thank you. Yeah, I've got
an idea for an electric jet.

00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:39.244
- You do?
- Yeah.

00:08:39.324 --> 00:08:41.364
Then we'll make it work.

00:08:41.764 --> 00:08:43.244
- You want a massage?
- Oh, God.

00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:44.724
- No, I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an...

00:08:44.844 --> 00:08:46.244
- I don't want Natalie to do...
- Don't want you tense.

00:08:46.324 --> 00:08:47.524
By the way, I didn't
mean to spring this on you.

00:08:47.604 --> 00:08:48.764
Thank you very much.

00:08:48.844 --> 00:08:50.764
- Green is not your best color.
- Oh, please.

00:08:50.844 --> 00:08:52.204
Anthony! Is that you?

00:08:52.284 --> 00:08:53.764
- Hey, pal.
- My least favorite person on Earth.

00:08:53.844 --> 00:08:55.124
- Justin Hammer.
- How you doing?

00:08:55.204 --> 00:08:58.044
You're not the only rich
guy here with a fancy car.

00:08:58.124 --> 00:09:00.564
You know Christine Everhart
from <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:01.764
- You guys know each other?
- Hi.

00:09:01.844 --> 00:09:03.084
- Yes.
- Yes!

00:09:03.164 --> 00:09:04.284
- Yes, roughly.
- We do.

00:09:04.404 --> 00:09:09.084
BTW, big story. The new CEO of
Stark Industries. Congratulations.

00:09:09.164 --> 00:09:11.084
I know. I know.
My editor will kill me

00:09:11.164 --> 00:09:12.884
if I don't grab a quote for
our Powerful Women issue.

00:09:12.964 --> 00:09:14.604
- Can I?
- Oh! Sure.

00:09:14.684 --> 00:09:17.244
She's actually doing a big
spread on me for <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

00:09:17.324 --> 00:09:19.204
- I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.
- Right.

00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:20.404
- Right?
- Yes.

00:09:20.484 --> 00:09:23.804
Well, she did quite a
spread on Tony last year.

00:09:23.884 --> 00:09:25.244
And she wrote a story as well.

00:09:25.324 --> 00:09:26.324
It was very impressive.

00:09:26.404 --> 00:09:27.404
That was good.

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:29.484
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

00:09:29.564 --> 00:09:31.084
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Don't leave me.

00:09:31.164 --> 00:09:32.604
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
- I'm all right.

00:09:32.724 --> 00:09:33.964
- Looking gorgeous.
- Please, this is tough.

00:09:34.044 --> 00:09:35.324
Can I ask you...
Is this the first time...

00:09:35.404 --> 00:09:36.684
<i>Fromage.</i>

00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:38.284
- Say, "Brie."
- ...that you guys have seen each other?

00:09:38.364 --> 00:09:40.644
God, that's so awful.

00:09:40.724 --> 00:09:43.084
Listen, is it the first time you've
seen each other since the Senate?

00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:44.804
Since he got his
contract revoked...

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:45.964
Actually, it's on hold.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.124
...when you were
attempting to...

00:09:47.204 --> 00:09:49.164
That's not what I heard.
What's the difference between "hold"

00:09:49.244 --> 00:09:51.124
- and "canceled"? The truth?
- Yes, what is?

00:09:51.244 --> 00:09:53.604
No. The truth is...
Why don't we put that away?

00:09:53.684 --> 00:09:57.644
The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.

00:09:57.724 --> 00:10:00.164
Well, if you invent
something that works,

00:10:00.244 --> 00:10:01.644
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

00:10:01.724 --> 00:10:02.804
Mr. Stark?

00:10:02.924 --> 00:10:04.264
- Yes?
- Your corner table is ready.

00:10:04.344 --> 00:10:06.204
I actually have a slot this year.
Yes, I do.

00:10:06.284 --> 00:10:07.524
Hammer needs a slot, Christine.

00:10:07.604 --> 00:10:09.444
We kid, yeah.

00:10:10.364 --> 00:10:11.524
We kid. We're kidders.

00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:35.924
Got any other bad ideas?

00:10:40.124 --> 00:10:41.284
Tony!

00:10:45.124 --> 00:10:47.884
Tony and I... Tony...
I love Tony Stark.

00:10:47.964 --> 00:10:49.404
Tony loves me.
We're not competitors.

00:10:49.484 --> 00:10:52.004
Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:53.364
for Hammer Industries, you know?

00:10:54.604 --> 00:10:56.164
Everything that Tony and I do...

00:10:56.244 --> 00:10:58.004
<i>Well, what's the
use of having...</i>

00:10:58.084 --> 00:10:59.204
...is a healthy...

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.924
<i>...and owning a race car...</i>

00:11:01.004 --> 00:11:02.124
...competition.

00:11:02.284 --> 00:11:03.404
<i>...if you don't drive it?</i>

00:11:05.004 --> 00:11:06.604
Is he driving?

00:11:13.804 --> 00:11:15.524
Natalie. Natalie!

00:11:16.484 --> 00:11:17.684
- Yes, Miss Potts?
- Did you know about this?

00:11:17.764 --> 00:11:19.244
This is the first that
I have known of it.

00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:21.764
This... This cannot happen.

00:11:21.844 --> 00:11:23.564
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?

00:11:23.644 --> 00:11:24.884
- Where's Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

00:11:25.004 --> 00:11:26.804
- Okay, get him. I need Happy.
- Right away.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.724
Tony's... You know, he...

00:11:29.804 --> 00:11:31.684
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

00:11:31.804 --> 00:11:32.884
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

00:11:32.964 --> 00:11:34.404
can you excuse
me just one second?

00:11:34.484 --> 00:11:35.924
Just read me what you wrote.

00:11:36.004 --> 00:11:37.204
- I will. I will, after.
- Just read it back to me.

00:11:37.284 --> 00:11:38.524
But I have to make
one quick phone call.

00:11:38.604 --> 00:11:39.724
- Where are you going?
- This is great.

00:11:39.804 --> 00:11:41.124
- I've got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff.

00:11:41.204 --> 00:11:42.764
- I'll be right back.
- Look!

00:11:42.844 --> 00:11:44.324
That's Stark.

00:13:42.444 --> 00:13:43.924
Go, go!

00:13:47.124 --> 00:13:48.444
Hang on.

00:14:57.364 --> 00:14:59.244
- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.

00:14:59.324 --> 00:15:00.924
- Where's the key?
- It's in my pocket.

00:15:01.004 --> 00:15:02.164
Car!

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:07.244
Oh, my God!

00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:15.724
Are you okay?

00:16:15.804 --> 00:16:16.804
Yeah.

00:16:16.924 --> 00:16:17.964
Were you heading for me or him?

00:16:18.044 --> 00:16:19.044
I was trying to scare him.

00:16:19.124 --> 00:16:20.124
'Cause I can't tell!

00:16:20.404 --> 00:16:21.404
Are you out of your mind?

00:16:21.484 --> 00:16:23.484
- Better security.
- Get in the car right now!

00:16:23.564 --> 00:16:25.284
I was attacked!
We need better security.

00:16:25.364 --> 00:16:26.364
Get in the car!

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:29.444
You're CEO. Better security measures.
God, it's embarrassing.

00:16:30.284 --> 00:16:32.604
First vacation in two years.

00:16:37.244 --> 00:16:38.644
Oh, my God!

00:16:39.724 --> 00:16:40.724
I got him!

00:16:40.804 --> 00:16:42.004
Hit him again. Hit him again.

00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:43.964
Football.

00:16:46.404 --> 00:16:47.404
I got him!

00:16:47.484 --> 00:16:48.484
Take the case! Take it!

00:16:48.564 --> 00:16:50.244
- Take the case!
- Give him the case!

00:16:50.324 --> 00:16:51.684
Stop banging the car!

00:16:55.284 --> 00:16:56.644
Calm down.

00:16:57.564 --> 00:16:59.564
God! God!

00:17:02.164 --> 00:17:04.924
Give me the case!
Please! Come on!

00:18:36.524 --> 00:18:37.564
You...

00:18:37.844 --> 00:18:38.884
You lose.

00:18:45.244 --> 00:18:47.924
You lose. You lose, Stark.

00:19:29.239 --> 00:19:30.559
Thank you.

00:19:30.599 --> 00:19:31.599
Thank you.

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:32.679
You're very welcome.

00:19:41.934 --> 00:19:43.658
<i>Our dearest friend banished,</i>

00:19:43.709 --> 00:19:46.398
Loki on the throne,
Asgard on the brink of war,

00:19:46.448 --> 00:19:50.221
yet you've managed to consume
four wild boar, six pheasant,

00:19:50.271 --> 00:19:53.232
a side of beef,
and two casks of ale.

00:19:53.345 --> 00:19:55.351
Shame on you. Don't you care?

00:19:55.974 --> 00:19:58.014
Do not mistake my
appetite for apathy!

00:19:58.044 --> 00:19:59.884
Stop it, both of you!

00:20:00.204 --> 00:20:01.204
Stop.

00:20:02.564 --> 00:20:03.844
We all know what we have to do.

00:20:03.884 --> 00:20:04.924
We must go.

00:20:07.564 --> 00:20:09.884
We must find Thor.

00:20:11.164 --> 00:20:12.204
It's treason.

00:20:12.284 --> 00:20:14.044
To hell with treason,
it's suicide.

00:20:14.284 --> 00:20:16.284
Thor would do the same for us.

00:20:17.404 --> 00:20:18.724
Now shush.

00:20:20.284 --> 00:20:22.564
Heimdall might be watching.

00:20:27.564 --> 00:20:30.244
Heimdall demands your presence.

00:20:34.764 --> 00:20:36.084
We're doomed.

00:20:36.432 --> 00:20:39.952
You would defy the
commands of Loki, our king,

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.150
break every oath you
have taken as warriors,

00:20:43.214 --> 00:20:45.534
and commit treason
to bring Thor back?

00:20:45.734 --> 00:20:47.214
- Yes.
- Good.

00:20:47.854 --> 00:20:48.974
So you'll help us?

00:20:49.054 --> 00:20:51.454
I am bound by honor to our king.

00:20:51.494 --> 00:20:53.854
I cannot open the bridge to you.

00:20:54.574 --> 00:20:56.454
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

00:20:56.534 --> 00:20:58.174
Now what do we do?

00:20:58.948 --> 00:21:00.228
Look!

00:21:20.214 --> 00:21:21.534
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, sir.

00:21:21.654 --> 00:21:22.934
We got massive energy
readings out of nowhere

00:21:23.054 --> 00:21:24.414
and then they just disappeared.

00:21:24.494 --> 00:21:25.534
Fifteen miles due northwest.

00:21:25.574 --> 00:21:26.934
Let's go take a look.

00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:45.656
Mom?

00:21:53.536 --> 00:21:55.536
Is there a
Renaissance Fair in town?

00:21:55.696 --> 00:21:57.016
Call it in.

00:21:57.696 --> 00:21:58.696
Yeah.

00:22:00.576 --> 00:22:04.176
Base, we've got Xena,
Jackie Chan, and Robin Hood.

00:22:04.736 --> 00:22:07.016
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

00:22:07.736 --> 00:22:09.136
But you won't be
able to convince

00:22:09.216 --> 00:22:11.016
the scientific
community of any of it.

00:22:11.056 --> 00:22:12.416
Not without hard evidence.

00:22:13.376 --> 00:22:14.696
Found you!

00:22:20.696 --> 00:22:22.376
My friends!

00:22:23.856 --> 00:22:26.136
This is good! This is good.

00:22:26.216 --> 00:22:27.416
I don't believe it.

00:22:27.896 --> 00:22:30.856
Oh, excuse me.
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

00:22:33.336 --> 00:22:34.896
My friends,

00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:37.416
I've never been
happier to see anyone.

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:39.336
But you should not have come.

00:22:41.376 --> 00:22:42.896
We're here to take you home.

00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:46.056
You know I can't go home.

00:22:48.164 --> 00:22:49.736
My father

00:22:50.736 --> 00:22:51.896
is dead because of me.

00:22:52.856 --> 00:22:55.056
And I must remain in exile.

00:22:55.216 --> 00:22:56.416
Thor,

00:22:56.776 --> 00:22:58.696
your father still lives.

00:23:12.071 --> 00:23:14.551
Ensure my brother
does not return.

00:23:18.391 --> 00:23:20.071
Destroy everything.

00:23:58.504 --> 00:24:02.184
Pretty decent tech.
Cycles per second were a little low.

00:24:07.944 --> 00:24:10.864
You could have
doubled up your rotations.

00:24:13.504 --> 00:24:16.264
You focused the repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

00:24:16.344 --> 00:24:19.344
It's effective.
Not very efficient.

00:24:20.344 --> 00:24:22.704
But it's a passable knock-off.

00:24:23.624 --> 00:24:24.864
I don't get it.
A little fine tuning,

00:24:24.944 --> 00:24:26.784
you could have made
a solid paycheck.

00:24:26.864 --> 00:24:31.024
You could have sold it to
North Korea, China, Iran,

00:24:31.104 --> 00:24:33.744
or gone right to
the black market.

00:24:33.824 --> 00:24:36.784
You look like you got
friends in low places.

00:24:36.864 --> 00:24:42.384
You come from a family
of thieves and butchers.

00:24:43.784 --> 00:24:46.064
And now, like all guilty men,

00:24:47.024 --> 00:24:49.624
you try to rewrite
your own history.

00:24:50.304 --> 00:24:55.304
And you forget all the lives
the Stark family has destroyed.

00:24:56.464 --> 00:24:59.744
Speaking of thieves, where
did you get this design?

00:24:59.824 --> 00:25:02.744
My father. Anton Vanko.

00:25:03.904 --> 00:25:06.064
Well, I never heard of him.

00:25:07.184 --> 00:25:09.904
My father is the
reason you're alive.

00:25:10.144 --> 00:25:13.784
The reason I'm alive is 'cause you
had a shot, you took it, you missed.

00:25:13.864 --> 00:25:15.064
Did I?

00:25:17.904 --> 00:25:20.104
If you can make God bleed,

00:25:21.064 --> 00:25:23.904
the people will cease
to believe in him.

00:25:25.264 --> 00:25:29.584
And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.

00:25:31.584 --> 00:25:36.024
The truth, all I have to
do is sit here and watch

00:25:36.104 --> 00:25:38.664
as the world will consume you.

00:25:38.744 --> 00:25:40.824
Where will you be watching
the world consume me from?

00:25:40.904 --> 00:25:44.824
That's right. A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

00:25:44.904 --> 00:25:47.184
Hey, Tony. Before you go,

00:25:47.264 --> 00:25:50.624
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

00:26:08.104 --> 00:26:11.544
<i>It's just unbelievable. It proves
that the genie is out of the bottle</i>

00:26:11.624 --> 00:26:14.064
<i>and this man has no
idea what he's doing.</i>

00:26:14.144 --> 00:26:17.904
<i>He thinks of the Iron
Man weapon as a toy.</i>

00:26:17.984 --> 00:26:22.864
<i>I was at a hearing where
Mr. Stark, in fact, was adamant</i>

00:26:22.944 --> 00:26:26.584
<i>that these suits can't
exist anywhere else,</i>

00:26:26.664 --> 00:26:29.184
<i>don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist anywhere else,</i>

00:26:29.264 --> 00:26:30.584
<i>at least for five to 10 years,</i>

00:26:30.664 --> 00:26:32.744
<i>and here we are
in Monaco realizing,</i>

00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:35.304
<i>"Uh-oh. These suits exist now."</i>

00:26:35.424 --> 00:26:36.584
Mute.

00:26:38.824 --> 00:26:42.184
He should be giving me a medal.
That's the truth.

00:26:45.664 --> 00:26:46.744
What is that?

00:26:46.824 --> 00:26:49.504
This is your in-flight meal.

00:26:52.504 --> 00:26:54.664
Did you just make that?

00:26:54.744 --> 00:26:58.184
Yeah. Where do you think
I've been for three hours?

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:00.344
Tony,

00:27:02.504 --> 00:27:04.784
what are you not telling me?

00:27:08.704 --> 00:27:10.184
I don't want to go home.

00:27:10.944 --> 00:27:12.104
At all.

00:27:13.944 --> 00:27:16.624
Let's cancel my
birthday party and...

00:27:16.704 --> 00:27:19.304
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.

00:27:19.384 --> 00:27:20.624
- Remember?
- Oh, yes.

00:27:20.704 --> 00:27:22.544
It's a great place to

00:27:25.024 --> 00:27:26.024
be healthy.

00:27:26.104 --> 00:27:28.224
I don't think this
is the right time.

00:27:28.304 --> 00:27:30.544
We're in kind of a mess.

00:27:30.624 --> 00:27:32.224
Yeah, but maybe that's
why it's the best time.

00:27:32.304 --> 00:27:33.304
'Cause then we...

00:27:33.384 --> 00:27:34.384
Well, I think as the CEO,

00:27:34.464 --> 00:27:35.584
I need to show up.

00:27:35.664 --> 00:27:39.984
As CEO, you are
entitled to a leave.

00:27:40.064 --> 00:27:41.384
- A leave?
- A company retreat.

00:27:41.464 --> 00:27:42.784
A retreat?
During a time like this?

00:27:42.864 --> 00:27:43.984
Just a ride.

00:27:44.064 --> 00:27:47.664
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge
our batteries and figure it all out.

00:27:47.744 --> 00:27:50.504
Not everybody runs
on batteries, Tony.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.620
Yes, but the fundamentals of the
company are still very, very strong

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.620
- despite the events in Monaco.
- Yes, of course.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.020
The AP wants a quote.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.140
Don't tell him. Fax them...

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.740
Where is he?

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.620
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.
- He's downstairs.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.180
<i>- ...what happened in Monaco?</i>
- Yes, but...

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.740
<i>But his continuing
erratic behavior</i>

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.980
<i>may lead many people
to ask themselves,</i>

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.900
<i>"Can this man still protect us?"</i>

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.540
Iron Man never
stopped protecting us.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.260
The events in
Monaco proved that.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.580
<i>Query complete, sir.</i>

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.940
<i>Anton Vanko was
a Soviet physicist</i>

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.020
<i>who defected to the
United States in 1963.</i>

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.260
<i>However, he was accused of
espionage and was deported in 1967.</i>

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.740
<i>His son, Ivan, who
is also a physicist,</i>

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.860
<i>was convicted of
selling Soviet-era</i>

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.580
<i>weapons-grade
plutonium to Pakistan,</i>

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.140
<i>and served 15 years
in Kopeisk prison.</i>

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.340
<i>No further records exist.</i>

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.540
Tony, you gotta get upstairs

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.860
and get on top of
this situation right now.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:00.220
Listen. I've been on the phone
with the National Guard all day,

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.140
trying to talk them out of
rolling tanks up the PCH,

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.100
knocking down your
front door and taking these.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.740
They're gonna take your suits, Tony, okay?
They're sick of the games.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.540
You said nobody else would
possess this technology for 20 years.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.820
Well, guess what?
Somebody else had it yesterday.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.220
It's not theoretical anymore.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.500
Are you listening to me?

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.420
Are you okay?

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.260
Let's go.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.380
Hey, man.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.380
Hey, hey!

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.300
- You all right?
- Yeah, I should get to my desk.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.940
See that cigar box?

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.060
Yeah.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.020
It's palladium.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.500
Is that supposed to be smoking?

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.500
If you must know,
it's neutron damage.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.860
It's from the reactor wall.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.740
You had this in your body?

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.620
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.860
Road rash.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.660
Thank you.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.140
What are you looking at?

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.260
I'm looking at you.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.740
You wanna do this
whole lone gunslinger act

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.860
and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.380
You know, I wish I
could believe that.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.500
I really do.
But you've gotta trust me.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.220
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

00:30:56.481 --> 00:30:58.921
Do you know which watch you'd
like to wear tonight, Mr. Stark?

00:30:59.241 --> 00:31:01.241
I'll give them a look.

00:31:04.161 --> 00:31:05.601
I should cancel the party, huh?

00:31:06.641 --> 00:31:07.641
Probably.

00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:09.521
Yeah. Cause it's, um...

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:10.641
Ill-timed.

00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:12.241
Right, sends the wrong message.

00:31:12.321 --> 00:31:13.841
Inappropriate.

00:31:19.681 --> 00:31:21.961
Is that dirty enough for you?

00:31:22.921 --> 00:31:26.721
Gold face, brown band.
The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.

00:31:27.201 --> 00:31:28.681
Bring them over here.

00:31:31.921 --> 00:31:34.081
I'll take that. Why don't you...

00:31:46.201 --> 00:31:48.521
I gotta say it.
It's hard to get a read on you.

00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:49.761
Where are you from?

00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:51.001
Legal.

00:31:53.761 --> 00:31:55.881
Can I ask you a
question, hypothetically?

00:31:55.961 --> 00:31:57.241
Bit odd.

00:31:57.521 --> 00:32:00.921
If this was your last birthday
party you were ever gonna have,

00:32:01.001 --> 00:32:02.601
how would you celebrate it?

00:32:05.241 --> 00:32:07.361
I'd do whatever I wanted to do

00:32:07.481 --> 00:32:09.441
with whoever I
wanted to do it with.

00:32:41.121 --> 00:32:42.241
Good evening.

00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:45.121
Yes, sir, I understand.

00:32:45.721 --> 00:32:49.481
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

00:32:49.561 --> 00:32:51.881
Sir, I personally guarantee
that within 24 hours,

00:32:51.961 --> 00:32:53.801
Iron Man will be back on watch.

Hey, Pepper.

00:33:02.881 --> 00:33:04.961
I'm...
I'm going to go get some air.

00:33:05.041 --> 00:33:06.481
What's wrong?

00:33:07.281 --> 00:33:08.281
I don't know what to do.

00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:09.561
You gotta be kidding me.

00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:16.801
That's it. I'm making...

00:33:16.881 --> 00:33:18.081
No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

00:33:18.161 --> 00:33:20.401
Pepper. This is ridiculous.
I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

00:33:20.481 --> 00:33:21.761
I know. I know. I get it.

00:33:21.841 --> 00:33:23.081
I'm gonna handle it, okay?
Just let me handle it.

00:33:23.161 --> 00:33:26.081
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

00:33:27.281 --> 00:33:28.961
You know, the question
I get asked most often is,

00:33:29.041 --> 00:33:31.561
"Tony, how do you go to
the bathroom in the suit?"

00:33:34.921 --> 00:33:36.041
Just like that.

00:33:40.001 --> 00:33:42.921
Does this guy know how
to throw a party or what?

00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:47.681
I love you.

00:33:47.761 --> 00:33:50.441
Unbelievable! Thank you so much.

00:33:50.521 --> 00:33:54.481
Tony, we all thank you so
much for such a wonderful night.

00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:56.401
And we're gonna
say good night now,

00:33:57.561 --> 00:33:58.561
and thank you all for coming.

00:33:58.641 --> 00:33:59.881
No, no, no, we can't...
Wait, wait, wait.

00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:01.761
We didn't have the cake.
We didn't blow out the candles.

00:34:01.841 --> 00:34:04.641
You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?

00:34:04.721 --> 00:34:05.721
You're out of control, gorgeous.

00:34:05.801 --> 00:34:06.921
It's time to go to bed.
It's time.

00:34:07.001 --> 00:34:08.161
- Give me another smooch.
- You're not going to be

00:34:08.241 --> 00:34:09.561
- happy about this.
- Come on, you know you want to.

00:34:09.641 --> 00:34:11.001
You just peed the suit.

00:34:11.081 --> 00:34:12.561
- I know. It has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

00:34:12.641 --> 00:34:14.041
You could drink that water.

00:34:14.521 --> 00:34:17.721
Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...

00:34:17.801 --> 00:34:19.561
- If you say so.
- Okay.

00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:21.801
I'll take this, you take that.

00:34:23.241 --> 00:34:24.561
Pepper Potts.

00:34:26.161 --> 00:34:27.681
She's right. The party's over.

00:34:27.761 --> 00:34:30.721
Then again, the party was over
for me, like, an hour and a half ago.

00:34:30.801 --> 00:34:34.321
The after-party
starts in 15 minutes!

00:34:37.921 --> 00:34:42.081
And if anybody, Pepper,
doesn't like it, there's the door.

00:34:48.561 --> 00:34:49.921
Yeah!

00:34:54.281 --> 00:34:55.561
Hit!

00:35:02.721 --> 00:35:03.921
Pull!

00:35:13.201 --> 00:35:14.401
Pull!

00:35:23.361 --> 00:35:25.561
I think she wants the Gallagher!

00:35:34.921 --> 00:35:36.841
I'm only gonna say this once.

00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:41.681
Get out.

00:35:48.201 --> 00:35:51.281
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

00:35:52.841 --> 00:35:54.041
Goldstein.

00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:56.521
Yes, Mr. Stark?

00:35:56.601 --> 00:35:59.841
Give me a phat beat to
beat my buddy's ass to.

00:36:03.641 --> 00:36:05.681
I told you to shut it down.

00:36:16.161 --> 00:36:19.721
Now, put that thing back where
you found it before someone gets hurt.

00:36:26.441 --> 00:36:27.681
Really?

00:36:35.521 --> 00:36:39.081
Sorry, pal, but Iron Man
doesn't have a sidekick.

00:36:39.681 --> 00:36:41.921
Sidekick this!

00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:51.921
Had enough?

00:36:52.881 --> 00:36:54.321
- Natalie!
- Miss Potts.

00:36:54.401 --> 00:36:56.481
Don't you "Miss Potts" me!
I'm on to you.

00:36:56.601 --> 00:36:58.121
You know what?
Ever since you came here...

00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:03.441
Pepper!

00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:06.241
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

00:37:12.561 --> 00:37:14.561
You want it?
Take it!

00:37:56.561 --> 00:37:57.721
Put your hand down.

00:37:57.801 --> 00:38:00.081
You think you got what
it takes to wear that suit?

00:38:00.161 --> 00:38:01.561
We don't have to do this, Tony.

00:38:01.641 --> 00:38:03.401
You wanna be the War
Machine, take your shot.

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:05.321
- Put it down!
- You gonna take a shot?

00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:06.641
- Put it down!
- No!

00:38:06.721 --> 00:38:08.161
- Drop it, Tony!
- Take it!

00:39:19.282 --> 00:39:21.521

00:39:21.601 --> 00:39:26.161

miles east at 5,000 feet...</i>

00:40:09.361 --> 00:40:10.681

00:40:11.601 --> 00:40:12.921

00:40:13.601 --> 00:40:14.801
Wow.

00:40:15.961 --> 00:40:17.281
Yeah.

00:40:19.121 --> 00:40:21.041
Let's take it inside.

00:40:21.121 --> 00:40:22.641
Clear the area.

00:40:41.178 --> 00:40:44.218
Tell me, Loki, how did you
get the Jotuns into Asgard?

00:40:44.298 --> 00:40:47.858
You think the Bifrost is the
only way in and out of this realm?

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:49.458
There are secret paths
between the worlds

00:40:49.578 --> 00:40:52.298
to which even you, with
all your gifts, are blind.

00:40:52.338 --> 00:40:55.498
But I have need of them
no longer, now that I am king.

00:40:55.618 --> 00:40:57.298
And I say, for
your act of treason,

00:40:57.618 --> 00:41:00.298
you are relieved of your
duties as Gatekeeper,

00:41:00.418 --> 00:41:02.138
and no longer citizen of Asgard.

00:41:02.658 --> 00:41:05.258
Then I need no longer obey you.

00:41:25.778 --> 00:41:28.658
Get somebody from
Linguistics down here.

00:41:55.978 --> 00:41:57.698
Was somebody else coming?

00:42:01.858 --> 00:42:02.898
Is that one of Stark's?

00:42:03.058 --> 00:42:06.578
I don't know.
The guy never tells me anything.

00:42:10.559 --> 00:42:11.759
Hello.

00:42:11.879 --> 00:42:14.599
You are using unregistered
weapons technology.

00:42:14.639 --> 00:42:15.799
Identify yourself.

00:42:19.833 --> 00:42:20.833
Here we go.

00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:25.319
Incoming!

00:42:33.079 --> 00:42:34.399
Jane, you have to leave.

00:42:34.479 --> 00:42:35.519
What are you gonna do?

00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:36.599
I'm staying here.

00:42:36.799 --> 00:42:38.479
Thor's going to fight with us!

00:42:38.799 --> 00:42:40.119
My friends,

00:42:40.519 --> 00:42:43.119
I'm just a man.
I'll only be in the way,

00:42:43.159 --> 00:42:44.519
or worse, get one of you killed.

00:42:44.639 --> 00:42:46.679
But I can help get
these people to safety.

00:42:46.959 --> 00:42:48.999
Well, if you're staying,
then so am I.

00:42:49.319 --> 00:42:50.479
We'll need some time.

00:42:50.519 --> 00:42:51.639
You'll have it!

00:42:52.279 --> 00:42:53.759
Okay, move it, people!

00:42:54.639 --> 00:42:56.799
Everybody out!
Use the back door.

00:42:57.439 --> 00:42:58.799
Go, hurry! You can eat later.

00:43:11.479 --> 00:43:13.359
Keep it distracted.

00:43:27.999 --> 00:43:30.519
For Asgard!

00:44:05.879 --> 00:44:06.879
Fall back!

00:44:23.559 --> 00:44:25.119
Go. Now. Run!

00:44:52.879 --> 00:44:55.399
Sif. Sif, you've
done all you can.

00:44:55.719 --> 00:44:57.919
No. I will die
a warrior's death.

00:44:58.239 --> 00:45:00.159
Stories will be
told of this day.

00:45:00.439 --> 00:45:03.159
Live, and tell those
stories yourself.

00:45:05.719 --> 00:45:07.279
Now go.

00:45:14.799 --> 00:45:17.759
You must return to Asgard.
You have to stop Loki.

00:45:17.959 --> 00:45:19.399
What about you?

00:45:19.439 --> 00:45:21.959
Do not worry, my friends.
I have a plan.

00:45:22.759 --> 00:45:23.919
Come on.

00:45:27.959 --> 00:45:30.319
We need to fall back. Come on.

00:45:30.359 --> 00:45:31.359
Come on.

00:45:39.279 --> 00:45:40.439
Wait!

00:45:48.319 --> 00:45:49.479
What's he doing?

00:46:16.359 --> 00:46:19.999
Brother, whatever I
have done to wrong you,

00:46:20.359 --> 00:46:23.359
whatever I have done
to lead you to do this,

00:46:23.679 --> 00:46:25.519
I am truly sorry.

00:46:26.239 --> 00:46:28.719
<i>But these people are innocent.</i>

00:46:29.839 --> 00:46:33.199
Taking their lives
will gain you nothing.

00:46:40.719 --> 00:46:42.199
So take mine

00:46:42.999 --> 00:46:44.239
and end this.

00:46:58.359 --> 00:46:59.359
No.

00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:16.719
It's over.

00:47:17.079 --> 00:47:19.399
No. It's not over.

00:47:20.039 --> 00:47:21.959
I mean, you're safe.

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:24.079
We're safe.

00:47:24.399 --> 00:47:25.759
It's over.

00:47:31.759 --> 00:47:33.039
No.

00:47:51.439 --> 00:47:52.479
No.

00:48:18.359 --> 00:48:19.439
We're spiking.

00:48:19.479 --> 00:48:20.519
Levels increase!

00:48:20.799 --> 00:48:22.479
Whosoever holds this hammer,

00:48:24.999 --> 00:48:25.999
if he be worthy,

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:31.199
shall possess the power of Thor.

00:48:46.962 --> 00:48:47.962
Jane!

00:48:50.639 --> 00:48:52.119
No. No. No!

00:48:52.159 --> 00:48:53.679
Come!

00:50:23.971 --> 00:50:25.371
So, is this how
you normally look?

00:50:26.244 --> 00:50:27.244
More or less.

00:50:28.698 --> 00:50:30.578
We must go to the Bifrost site.

00:50:30.618 --> 00:50:31.778
I would have words
with my brother.

00:50:31.898 --> 00:50:32.938
Excuse me!

00:50:36.898 --> 00:50:38.218
Donald?

00:50:39.258 --> 00:50:40.778
I don't think you've been
completely honest with me.

00:50:40.818 --> 00:50:42.138
Know this,
Son of Coul.

00:50:42.258 --> 00:50:45.258
You and I, we fight for the same
cause, the protection of this world.

00:50:45.378 --> 00:50:47.458
From this day forward, you
can count me as your ally

00:50:47.498 --> 00:50:50.498
if you return the items
you have taken from Jane.

00:50:50.618 --> 00:50:52.258
- Stolen.
- Borrowed.

00:50:53.098 --> 00:50:55.298
Of course, you can have
your equipment back.

00:50:55.338 --> 00:50:57.498
You're gonna need it to
continue your research.

00:50:58.298 --> 00:51:00.618
Would you like to see
the bridge we spoke of?

00:51:01.778 --> 00:51:02.898
Sure.

00:51:04.578 --> 00:51:06.578
Wait, I need to debrief you!

00:51:14.018 --> 00:51:15.178
Welcome to Asgard.

00:51:40.658 --> 00:51:42.818
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.

00:51:50.498 --> 00:51:51.858
Heimdall?

00:51:56.018 --> 00:51:57.338
<i>Heimdall!</i>

00:51:59.498 --> 00:52:00.898
He doesn't answer.

00:52:01.658 --> 00:52:03.178
Then we are stranded.

00:52:03.218 --> 00:52:06.178
Heimdall!
If you can hear me, we need you now!

00:52:07.734 --> 00:52:10.134
<i>Heimdall! We need you now!</i>

00:52:16.258 --> 00:52:17.538
Heimdall!

00:52:32.098 --> 00:52:35.218
I must go back to Asgard,
but I give you my word,

00:52:36.418 --> 00:52:38.778
I will return for you.

00:52:46.378 --> 00:52:47.578
Deal?

00:53:01.138 --> 00:53:02.458
Deal.

00:53:36.064 --> 00:53:39.464
Sir! I'm gonna have to
ask you to exit the donut.

00:53:43.824 --> 00:53:45.984
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

00:53:46.064 --> 00:53:50.584
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

00:53:50.664 --> 00:53:51.784
How's that working out for you?

00:53:51.864 --> 00:53:53.224
It's... It's... It's...

00:53:55.344 --> 00:53:56.704
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.

00:53:56.784 --> 00:53:58.584
Do I look at the
patch or the eye?

00:53:59.664 --> 00:54:00.744
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

00:54:00.824 --> 00:54:03.224
I'm not sure if you're
real or if I'm having...

00:54:03.304 --> 00:54:05.384
I am very real.

00:54:05.464 --> 00:54:07.464
I'm the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

00:54:07.984 --> 00:54:09.544
Just my luck.
Where's the staff here?

00:54:09.624 --> 00:54:11.184
That's not looking so good.

00:54:11.984 --> 00:54:13.984
I've been worse.

00:54:15.624 --> 00:54:16.664
We've secured the perimeter,

00:54:16.784 --> 00:54:19.664
but I don't think we should
hold it for too much longer.

00:54:20.704 --> 00:54:22.104
Huh!

00:54:23.184 --> 00:54:25.104
You're... fired.

00:54:25.184 --> 00:54:26.704
That's not up to you.

00:54:26.784 --> 00:54:29.944
Tony, I want you to
meet Agent Romanoff.

00:54:30.024 --> 00:54:31.184
- Hi.
- I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

00:54:31.304 --> 00:54:33.904
Once we knew you were ill,
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

00:54:33.984 --> 00:54:35.784
I suggest you apologize.

00:54:35.864 --> 00:54:37.464
You've been very busy.

00:54:37.544 --> 00:54:40.784
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

00:54:40.864 --> 00:54:43.864
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

00:54:43.944 --> 00:54:45.304
Now, if I didn't know better...

00:54:45.384 --> 00:54:47.424
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.

00:54:47.504 --> 00:54:50.144
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

00:54:50.224 --> 00:54:53.464
You're Iron Man
and he just took it?

00:54:53.544 --> 00:54:56.304
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

00:54:56.384 --> 00:54:57.624
Is that possible?

00:54:57.704 --> 00:55:00.304
Well, according to Mr. Stark's
database security guidelines,

00:55:00.384 --> 00:55:03.384
there are redundancies to
prevent unauthorized usage.

00:55:06.184 --> 00:55:07.184
What do you want from me?

00:55:07.264 --> 00:55:08.824
What do we want from you?
Uh-uh.

00:55:08.904 --> 00:55:10.824
What do you want from me?

00:55:10.904 --> 00:55:14.584
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

00:55:14.664 --> 00:55:17.904
Contrary to your belief, you
are not the center of my universe.

00:55:17.984 --> 00:55:19.224
I have bigger problems than you

00:55:19.304 --> 00:55:20.984
in the southwest
region to deal with.

00:55:21.064 --> 00:55:22.184
Hit him.

00:55:22.384 --> 00:55:26.544
Oh, God, are you gonna
steal my kidney and sell it?

00:55:27.184 --> 00:55:30.104
Could you please not do
anything awful for five seconds?

00:55:30.664 --> 00:55:31.944
What did she just do to me?

00:55:32.024 --> 00:55:34.304
What did we just do for you?

00:55:34.384 --> 00:55:36.824
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

00:55:36.904 --> 00:55:38.784
We're trying to get
you back to work.

00:55:38.864 --> 00:55:40.944
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

00:55:41.024 --> 00:55:42.944
It's not a cure, it just
abates the symptoms.

00:55:43.024 --> 00:55:45.544
Doesn't look like it's
gonna be an easy fix.

00:55:45.624 --> 00:55:47.824
Trust me, I know.
I'm good at this stuff.

00:55:47.904 --> 00:55:50.264
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

00:55:50.344 --> 00:55:54.784
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

00:55:54.864 --> 00:55:57.944
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.
