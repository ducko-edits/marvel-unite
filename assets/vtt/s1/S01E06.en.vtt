00:00:11.152 --> 00:00:13.726
<i>…somehow equipped
with an undisclosed…</i>

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.701
<i>Stark high-tech powered battle--</i>

00:00:15.784 --> 00:00:17.700
<i>I know that it's confusing.</i>

00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:19.297
<i>It is one thing…</i>

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.095
<i>to question the official story
and another thing…</i>

00:00:21.178 --> 00:00:25.039
<i>entirely to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:30.210
<i>I mean let's face it,
I'm not the heroic type.</i>

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:33.260
<i>A laundry list of character defects…</i>

00:00:33.343 --> 00:00:36.180
<i>all the mistakes I've made,
largely public.</i>

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:37.709
<i>The truth is…</i>

00:00:42.852 --> 00:00:44.255
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:57.082
Ivan.

00:01:02.038 --> 00:01:03.611
Vanya.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.914
<i>My bond is with the people.</i>

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:44.330
<i>And I will serve this great nation…</i>

00:02:44.413 --> 00:02:47.740
<i>at the pleasure of myself.</i>

00:02:48.092 --> 00:02:51.155
<i>Is one thing I've proven
it's that you can count on me…</i>

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:52.831
<i>to pleasure myself.</i>

00:03:56.626 --> 00:03:59.807
The notary's here! Can you please
come sign the transfer paperwork?

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.267
I'm on happy time.

00:04:07.857 --> 00:04:09.108
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:11.670
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:13.743
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

00:04:13.826 --> 00:04:15.394
Alright, put them up. Come on.

00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:23.630
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

00:04:25.082 --> 00:04:27.327
I need you to initial each box.

00:04:28.044 --> 00:04:28.766
Lesson one.

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.632
Never take your eye off…

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.300
That's it. I'm done.

00:04:34.383 --> 00:04:35.251
What's your name, lady?

00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:36.725
Rushman. Natalie Rushman.

00:04:36.808 --> 00:04:38.471
Front and centre.
Come into the church.

00:04:38.554 --> 00:04:39.991
No. You're seriously not gonna ask…

00:04:40.074 --> 00:04:42.350
If it pleases the court, which it does.

00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:45.834
- It's no problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

00:04:59.262 --> 00:05:00.456
What?

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:05.520
Can you give her a lesson?

00:05:05.603 --> 00:05:06.842
No problem.

00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:08.271
Pepper.

00:05:08.372 --> 00:05:09.488
What?

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:11.128
Who is she?

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:12.559
She is from legal.

00:05:12.642 --> 00:05:17.191
And she is potentially a very expensive
sexual harassment lawsuit…

00:05:17.274 --> 00:05:19.036
- …if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need a new assistant, boss.

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:20.373
- Yes, and I've got three…
- I need a new assistant.

00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:21.925
…excellent potential candidates.

00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:23.558
They're lined up and ready to meet you.

00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:25.535
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now.

00:05:25.618 --> 00:05:26.519
I feel like it's her.

00:05:26.602 --> 00:05:27.656
No, it's not.

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:29.564
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

00:05:29.647 --> 00:05:30.644
What, like, the Tae Bo?

00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:31.593
Booty Boot Camp?

00:05:31.676 --> 00:05:33.302
Crunch? Something like that?

00:05:33.692 --> 00:05:35.293
How do I spell your name, Natalie?

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:37.447
R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.131
What, are you gonna Google her now?

00:05:39.342 --> 00:05:41.016
I thought I was ogling her.

00:05:43.152 --> 00:05:44.756
Very, very impressive individual.

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.144
- She's fluent in French…
- You're so predictable, you know that?

00:05:46.227 --> 00:05:47.988
…Italian, Russian, Latin.

00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:50.262
- Who speaks Latin?
- No one speaks Latin.

00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:52.140
- No one speaks Latin?
- It's a dead language.

00:05:52.378 --> 00:05:54.416
You can read Latin
or you can write Latin…

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:55.637
- …but you can't speak Latin.
- Did you model in Tokyo?

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.675
Because she modeled in Tokyo.

00:05:57.758 --> 00:05:59.437
I need her.
She's got everything that I need.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.880
Rule number one,
never take your eye off your opponent.

00:06:04.056 --> 00:06:05.848
Oh, my God!

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:09.070
Happy!

00:06:09.153 --> 00:06:10.480
That's what I'm talking about.

00:06:10.563 --> 00:06:11.898
- I just slipped.
- You did?

00:06:11.981 --> 00:06:14.615
- Yeah.
- Looks like a TKO to me.

00:06:16.652 --> 00:06:17.298
Just…

00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:18.863
I need your impression.

00:06:18.946 --> 00:06:20.471
You have a quiet reserve.

00:06:20.554 --> 00:06:21.576
I don't know, you have an old soul.

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.391
I meant your fingerprint.

00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:24.530
Right.

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:28.761
- So, how are we doing?
- Great. Just…

00:06:28.844 --> 00:06:30.330
wrapping up. Hey.

00:06:31.876 --> 00:06:33.164
You're the boss.

00:06:33.788 --> 00:06:35.088
Will that be all, Mr Stark?

00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:37.049
- No.
- Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.

00:06:37.132 --> 00:06:38.691
Thank you very much.

00:06:42.052 --> 00:06:43.525
- I want one.
- No.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.102
You know, it's Europe.
Whatever happens the next 20 minutes…

00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:21.646
- …just go with it. Like that.
- Go with it? Go with what?

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:23.052
- Mr Stark?
- Hey.

00:07:23.135 --> 00:07:24.262
Hello. How was your flight?

00:07:24.345 --> 00:07:25.920
It was excellent.
Boy, it's nice to see you.

00:07:26.003 --> 00:07:28.711
We have one photographer from
the ACM, if you don't mind.

00:07:28.937 --> 00:07:29.942
Ok?

00:07:30.184 --> 00:07:32.270
- When did this happen? When?
- What? You made me do it.

00:07:32.353 --> 00:07:33.534
- I made you do what?
- You quit. Smile.

00:07:33.617 --> 00:07:34.897
Look right there.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.107
Stop acting constipated.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.650
- Don't flare your nostrils.
- You are so predictable.

00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:38.776
- That's the amazing thing.
- Right this way.

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:40.701
- You look fantastic…
- Why, thank you very much.

00:07:40.784 --> 00:07:42.399
…but that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?

00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:44.450
You have a 9:30 dinner.

00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:46.062
Perfect. I'll be there at 11:00. Is this us?

00:07:46.145 --> 00:07:46.699
Absolutely.

00:07:46.782 --> 00:07:48.244
It can be.

00:07:48.327 --> 00:07:49.377
Great. Make it us.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:49.996
Ok.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.364
Mr Musk.

00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:52.540
How are you?
Hi, Pepper.

00:07:52.623 --> 00:07:54.500
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

00:07:54.583 --> 00:07:56.797
Elon, how's it going?
Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.607
Thank you. Yeah…

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.011
I've got an idea for an electric jet.

00:07:59.094 --> 00:08:00.038
You do?
Yeah.

00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:01.676
Then we'll make it work.

00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:04.051
- You want a massage?
- Oh, God. No…

00:08:04.134 --> 00:08:05.284
- I'll have Natalie make an appointment.
- I don't want a massage.

00:08:05.367 --> 00:08:06.602
- I don't want you to be tense.
- I do not want Natalie to do anything.

00:08:06.685 --> 00:08:07.771
By the way, I didn't mean
to spring this on you.

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:09.279
Thank you very much.

00:08:09.546 --> 00:08:11.601
- Green is not your best colour.
- Oh, please.

00:08:11.684 --> 00:08:13.227
Anthony! Is that you?

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.604
- My least favourite person on Earth.
- Hey, pal.

00:08:14.687 --> 00:08:15.925
- Justin Hammer.
- How you doing?

00:08:16.008 --> 00:08:18.858
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:21.341
You know Christine Everhart
from Vanity Fair.

00:08:21.424 --> 00:08:22.572
- You guys know each other?
- Hi.

00:08:22.655 --> 00:08:23.920
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:25.156
- Yes, roughly.
- We do.

00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:27.420
BTW, big story.

00:08:27.503 --> 00:08:29.285
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

00:08:29.368 --> 00:08:30.709
- I know. I know.
- Congratulations.

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:34.207
My editor will kill me if I don't grab
a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.458
- Can I?
- Sure.

00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:38.044
She's actually doing a big spread
on me for Vanity Fair.

00:08:38.127 --> 00:08:40.046
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

00:08:40.129 --> 00:08:41.214
- Right. Yes.
- Right?

00:08:41.297 --> 00:08:44.721
Well, she did quite a spread
on Tony last year.

00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:46.303
And she wrote a story as well.

00:08:46.386 --> 00:08:48.221
- It was very impressive.
- That was good.

00:08:48.304 --> 00:08:50.348
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:51.830
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Don't leave me.

00:08:51.913 --> 00:08:53.531
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
- I'm alright.

00:08:53.614 --> 00:08:54.810
- Looking gorgeous.
- Please, this is tough.

00:08:54.893 --> 00:08:57.387
- Can I ask you is this, the first time…
- Fromage.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.099
- …that you guys have seen each other?
- Say, Brie.

00:08:59.182 --> 00:09:01.090
Oh God, that's so awful.

00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:03.918
Listen, is it the first time you've seen
each other since the Senate?

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:05.655
Since he got his contract revoked…

00:09:05.738 --> 00:09:07.949
- When you were attempting to--
- Actually, it's on hold.

00:09:08.032 --> 00:09:09.971
That's not what I heard.
What's the difference between hold…

00:09:10.054 --> 00:09:10.816
and cancelled?

00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:11.953
- Yes, what is?
- The truth?

00:09:12.036 --> 00:09:14.701
- No. The truth is…
- Why don't we put that away?

00:09:14.784 --> 00:09:18.501
The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.

00:09:18.584 --> 00:09:20.852
Well, if you invent something that works…

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.463
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:23.806
- Mr Stark?
- Yes.

00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:24.812
Your corner table is ready.

00:09:24.895 --> 00:09:27.051
- I actually have a slot this year.
- Yes, I do.

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:29.727
- Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
- We kid, yeah.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.647
We kid. We're kidders.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.463
You are failing!

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.118
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet…

00:12:21.201 --> 00:12:25.634
yet we are continually delayed because
you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield.

00:12:25.717 --> 00:12:27.687
This is hardly my area of expertise.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.311
I. I merely developed the weapons.

00:12:30.394 --> 00:12:32.223
I cannot fire them.

00:12:32.802 --> 00:12:36.722
Finish your mission, Doctor,
before the American finishes his.

00:12:36.907 --> 00:12:37.927
Sir.

00:12:40.006 --> 00:12:41.464
I am sorry, Herr Schmidt.

00:12:42.952 --> 00:12:44.819
We fought to the last man.

00:12:47.852 --> 00:12:49.920
Evidently not.

00:13:13.473 --> 00:13:15.173
Got any other bad ideas?

00:13:19.729 --> 00:13:21.196
Tony!

00:13:24.734 --> 00:13:25.709
Tony and I…

00:13:25.792 --> 00:13:27.589
Tony… I love Tony Stark.

00:13:27.672 --> 00:13:29.031
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

00:13:29.114 --> 00:13:31.534
Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities…

00:13:31.617 --> 00:13:33.658
for Hammer Industries, you know?

00:13:34.244 --> 00:13:35.829
Every. Everything that Tony and I…

00:13:35.912 --> 00:13:37.581
<i>- Well, what's the use of having…</i>
- …do is a healthy…

00:13:37.664 --> 00:13:39.844
<i>- …and owning a race car…</i>
- …is a healthy…

00:13:40.625 --> 00:13:41.587
…competition.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.053
<i>…if you don't drive it?</i>

00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:46.166
Is he driving?

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.135
Natalie. Natalie!

00:13:56.057 --> 00:13:57.758
- Yes, Ms Potts?
- Did you know about this?

00:13:57.841 --> 00:13:59.200
This is the first that I have known of it.

00:14:00.228 --> 00:14:01.419
This… This cannot happen.

00:14:01.502 --> 00:14:03.138
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?

00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:04.519
- Where's Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

00:14:04.602 --> 00:14:06.456
- Ok, get him. I need Happy.
- Right away.

00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:08.971
Tony is, we're, you know, he…

00:14:09.404 --> 00:14:11.281
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

00:14:11.364 --> 00:14:12.367
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know…

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.494
- …can you excuse me just one second?
- Just read me what you wrote.

00:14:15.577 --> 00:14:17.127
- I will after but I have…
- Just read it back to me.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.122
…to make one quick phone call.

00:14:18.205 --> 00:14:18.801
- Where are you going?
- This is great.

00:14:18.884 --> 00:14:20.567
- I've got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:21.967
- I'll be right back.
- Look!

00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:23.808
That's Stark.

00:16:21.911 --> 00:16:23.016
Go, go!

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.043
Hang on.

00:17:36.986 --> 00:17:38.701
- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.

00:17:38.905 --> 00:17:40.490
- Where's the key?
- It's in my pocket.

00:17:40.573 --> 00:17:41.647
Car!

00:18:45.388 --> 00:18:47.105
Oh, my God!

00:18:53.396 --> 00:18:54.782
Are you ok?

00:18:55.505 --> 00:18:56.480
Yeah.

00:18:56.563 --> 00:18:58.975
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I was trying to scare him.

00:18:59.058 --> 00:18:59.749
Because I can't tell!

00:18:59.832 --> 00:19:01.091
Are you out of your mind?

00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:03.747
- Better security. I was attacked!
- Get in the car right now!

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.972
- We need better security.
- You're a jerk!

00:19:05.055 --> 00:19:07.244
- Get in the car!
- You're CEO. Better security measures.

00:19:07.327 --> 00:19:09.191
God, it's embarrassing.

00:19:09.913 --> 00:19:12.464
First vacation in two years.

00:19:16.836 --> 00:19:18.553
Oh, my God!

00:19:19.339 --> 00:19:21.940
- I got him!
- Hit him again. Hit him again.

00:19:22.126 --> 00:19:23.126
Football.

00:19:26.012 --> 00:19:28.056
- I got him!
- Take the case! Take it!

00:19:28.139 --> 00:19:29.725
- Take the case!
- Give him the case!

00:19:29.808 --> 00:19:31.942
Stop banging the car!

00:19:34.854 --> 00:19:36.530
Calm down.

00:19:38.506 --> 00:19:40.807
God! God!

00:19:41.736 --> 00:19:43.469
Give me the case! Please!

00:19:43.552 --> 00:19:44.657
Come on!

00:21:16.873 --> 00:21:18.840
You… You lose.

00:21:24.881 --> 00:21:26.024
You lose.

00:21:26.107 --> 00:21:27.892
You lose, Stark.

00:21:56.696 --> 00:21:59.689
Remember when I made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney Island?

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.723
Yeah, and I threw up?

00:22:02.962 --> 00:22:04.298
This isn't payback, is it?

00:22:04.381 --> 00:22:06.102
Now why would I do that?

00:22:06.185 --> 00:22:08.887
We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.

00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:12.142
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.

00:22:12.802 --> 00:22:15.050
Wherever he's going,
they must need him bad.

00:22:21.902 --> 00:22:24.453
Let's get going because
they're moving like the devil.

00:22:24.807 --> 00:22:26.536
We only got about
a 10 second window.

00:22:26.619 --> 00:22:28.058
You miss that window…

00:22:28.144 --> 00:22:29.704
we're bugs on a windshield.

00:22:29.787 --> 00:22:30.672
Mind the gap.

00:22:30.755 --> 00:22:32.709
Better get moving, bugs.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.285
Now!

00:22:40.621 --> 00:22:41.687
Go!

00:23:40.535 --> 00:23:41.535
Stop him.

00:23:41.917 --> 00:23:43.339
Fire again.

00:24:35.335 --> 00:24:37.914
- I had him on the ropes.
- I know you did.

00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:39.615
Get down.

00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:43.147
Fire again.

00:24:43.663 --> 00:24:45.381
<i>Kill him. Now.</i>

00:24:52.854 --> 00:24:54.089
Bucky!

00:24:57.544 --> 00:24:59.121
Hang on.

00:25:00.947 --> 00:25:02.345
Grab my hand.

00:25:02.796 --> 00:25:03.796
Now!

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.877
Sit down.

00:26:15.054 --> 00:26:16.341
What is this?

00:26:16.424 --> 00:26:17.723
Steak.

00:26:18.353 --> 00:26:19.972
What is in it?

00:26:20.716 --> 00:26:21.752
Cow.

00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:28.269
Doctor, do you realize
how difficult it is…

00:26:28.352 --> 00:26:31.166
to get ahold of a prime cut
like that out here?

00:26:32.578 --> 00:26:34.277
I don't eat meat.

00:26:34.882 --> 00:26:36.034
Why not?

00:26:36.117 --> 00:26:37.711
It disagrees with me.

00:26:37.794 --> 00:26:41.328
How about cyanide?
Does that give you the rumbly tummy, too?

00:26:43.822 --> 00:26:47.158
Every Hydra agent that
we have tried to take alive…

00:26:47.241 --> 00:26:50.325
has crunched a little pill
before we can stop him.

00:26:50.699 --> 00:26:51.995
But not you.

00:26:52.747 --> 00:26:53.771
So…

00:26:54.292 --> 00:26:56.105
here is my brilliant theory.

00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:59.378
You want to live.

00:27:00.673 --> 00:27:03.132
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

00:27:03.437 --> 00:27:04.954
I bought you dinner.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.602
Given the valuable information
he has provided…

00:27:13.931 --> 00:27:17.641
and in exchange
for his full cooperation…

00:27:17.838 --> 00:27:20.953
Dr. Zola is being remanded
to Switzerland?

00:27:21.036 --> 00:27:23.401
I sent that message
to Washington this morning…

00:27:23.783 --> 00:27:25.462
of course it was encoded.

00:27:25.571 --> 00:27:27.809
You guys haven't broken
those codes, have you?

00:27:28.056 --> 00:27:29.144
That would be awkward.

00:27:29.227 --> 00:27:31.351
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

00:27:31.434 --> 00:27:33.041
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.

00:27:33.366 --> 00:27:35.044
You're a liability.

00:27:35.368 --> 00:27:37.469
You know more about
Schmidt than anyone.

00:27:37.877 --> 00:27:38.991
And…

00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:42.826
the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend…

00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:45.753
so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.

00:27:46.674 --> 00:27:49.270
It's you or Schmidt.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.101
It's just the hand you have been dealt.

00:27:54.387 --> 00:27:58.167
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

00:27:59.402 --> 00:28:02.475
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

00:28:02.558 --> 00:28:04.459
You do realize that's nuts, don't you?

00:28:04.634 --> 00:28:05.634
What?

00:28:06.718 --> 00:28:08.949
The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.

00:28:09.032 --> 00:28:11.451
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it.

00:28:11.727 --> 00:28:13.324
What's his target?

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.864
His target…

00:28:18.077 --> 00:28:20.166
is everywhere.

00:28:40.036 --> 00:28:41.639
Tomorrow...

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.865
Hydra will stand master of the world…

00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:50.047
borne to victory
on the wings of the Valkyrie.

00:28:50.278 --> 00:28:54.429
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:59.901
If they shoot down one plane,
hundreds more will rain fire upon them.

00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:06.539
If they cut off one head…

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.840
two more shall take its place.

00:29:10.432 --> 00:29:11.821
Hail Hydra.

00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:13.332
Hail Hydra!

00:29:13.555 --> 00:29:16.554
Hail Hydra!
Hail Hydra!

00:29:16.715 --> 00:29:19.218
Hail Hydra!
Hail Hydra!

00:29:19.301 --> 00:29:22.118
Hail Hydra!
Hail Hydra!

00:29:22.201 --> 00:29:23.437
Mr Stark…

00:29:39.719 --> 00:29:41.444
Five minutes. We're watching you.

00:29:57.471 --> 00:29:59.064
Pretty decent tech.

00:29:59.406 --> 00:30:01.208
Cycles per second were a little low.

00:30:06.897 --> 00:30:08.814
You could have doubled up
your rotations.

00:30:12.528 --> 00:30:15.281
You focused the repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

00:30:15.364 --> 00:30:16.754
It's effective.

00:30:17.432 --> 00:30:18.892
Not very efficient.

00:30:19.591 --> 00:30:21.170
But it's a passable knock-off.

00:30:22.579 --> 00:30:24.568
I don't get it. With a little fine tuning
you could've…

00:30:24.651 --> 00:30:25.750
made a solid paycheck.

00:30:25.833 --> 00:30:29.368
You could have sold it
to North Korea, China, Iran…

00:30:30.087 --> 00:30:32.027
or gone right to the black market.

00:30:32.798 --> 00:30:34.783
You look like you got friends
in low places.

00:30:35.843 --> 00:30:37.460
You come from a…

00:30:38.035 --> 00:30:41.690
family of thieves and butchers.

00:30:42.766 --> 00:30:44.793
And now, like all guilty men…

00:30:45.978 --> 00:30:48.518
you try to rewrite your own history.

00:30:49.273 --> 00:30:50.674
And you forget…

00:30:50.889 --> 00:30:54.459
all the lives,
the Stark family has destroyed.

00:30:55.445 --> 00:30:57.616
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

00:30:58.782 --> 00:31:00.034
My father.

00:31:00.251 --> 00:31:02.047
Anton Vanko.

00:31:02.848 --> 00:31:04.253
Well, I never heard of him.

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:08.787
My father is the reason you're alive.

00:31:09.126 --> 00:31:12.206
The reason I'm alive is because you
had a shot, you took it, you missed.

00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:13.987
Did I?

00:31:16.925 --> 00:31:19.228
If you can make God bleed…

00:31:20.053 --> 00:31:22.479
the people will cease to believe in him.

00:31:24.266 --> 00:31:26.700
And there will be blood in the water.

00:31:26.839 --> 00:31:28.853
And the sharks will come.

00:31:30.606 --> 00:31:34.198
The truth, all I have to do is
sit here and watch…

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.458
as the world will consume you.

00:31:37.664 --> 00:31:39.782
Where will you be watching
the world consume me from?

00:31:39.865 --> 00:31:40.996
That's right.

00:31:41.196 --> 00:31:43.660
A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

00:31:43.822 --> 00:31:44.805
Hey, Tony.

00:31:44.888 --> 00:31:46.116
Before you go…

00:31:46.199 --> 00:31:47.901
palladium in the chest…

00:31:48.196 --> 00:31:50.083
painful way to die.

00:31:57.211 --> 00:31:58.268
Alright.

00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:08.481
<i>It's just unbelievable.</i>

00:32:08.564 --> 00:32:10.484
<i>It proves that the genie
is out of the bottle…</i>

00:32:10.567 --> 00:32:13.065
<i>and this man has no idea
what he's doing.</i>

00:32:13.148 --> 00:32:14.997
<i>He thinks of the Iron Man…</i>

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.902
<i>weapon as a toy.</i>

00:32:16.985 --> 00:32:19.138
<i>I was at a hearing where Mr Stark…</i>

00:32:19.221 --> 00:32:21.792
<i>in fact, was adamant…</i>

00:32:21.907 --> 00:32:22.945
<i>that…</i>

00:32:23.028 --> 00:32:25.536
<i>these suits can't exist anywhere else…</i>

00:32:25.619 --> 00:32:28.163
<i>don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist anywhere else…</i>

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:29.582
<i>at least for five to 10 years…</i>

00:32:29.665 --> 00:32:32.108
<i>and here we are in Monaco realising…</i>

00:32:32.775 --> 00:32:34.295
<i>these suits exist now.</i>

00:32:34.378 --> 00:32:35.378
Mute.

00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:39.206
He should be giving me a medal.

00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:40.667
That's the truth.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.499
What is that?

00:32:45.582 --> 00:32:47.139
This is your…

00:32:47.552 --> 00:32:48.915
in-flight meal.

00:32:51.478 --> 00:32:53.191
Did you just make that?

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.001
Yeah. Where do you think
I've been for three hours?

00:32:58.151 --> 00:32:59.278
Tony…

00:33:01.488 --> 00:33:03.362
what are you not telling me?

00:33:07.661 --> 00:33:09.044
I don't want to go home.

00:33:09.938 --> 00:33:11.288
At all.

00:33:12.916 --> 00:33:15.370
Let's cancel my birthday party and, and…

00:33:15.711 --> 00:33:17.968
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.590
- Remember?
- Oh, yes.

00:33:19.673 --> 00:33:21.614
It's a great place to…

00:33:24.052 --> 00:33:26.845
- …be healthy.
- I don't think this is the right time.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.516
We're in kind of a mess.

00:33:29.599 --> 00:33:31.222
Yeah, but maybe that's why
it's the best time.

00:33:31.305 --> 00:33:32.430
- Well…
- Because then we--

00:33:32.513 --> 00:33:34.563
…I think as the CEO I need to show up.

00:33:34.646 --> 00:33:38.943
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

00:33:39.026 --> 00:33:40.361
A leave?
A company retreat.

00:33:40.444 --> 00:33:42.988
- A retreat? During a time like this?
- Just a ride.

00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:46.182
Well, I'm just saying to recharge
our batteries and figure it all out.

00:33:46.742 --> 00:33:49.566
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

00:34:00.576 --> 00:34:02.712
Our dearest friend banished…

00:34:02.795 --> 00:34:05.239
Loki on the throne,
Asgard on the brink of war…

00:34:05.322 --> 00:34:07.083
yet you've managed to consume…

00:34:07.166 --> 00:34:10.331
four wild boar,
six pheasant, a side of beef…

00:34:10.414 --> 00:34:11.877
and two casks of ale.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.278
Shame on you. Don't you care?

00:34:14.488 --> 00:34:16.997
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.818
Stop it, both of you!

00:34:19.095 --> 00:34:20.396
Stop.

00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:22.927
We all know what we have to do.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:24.201
We must go.

00:34:26.771 --> 00:34:28.817
We must find Thor.

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:31.208
It's treason.

00:34:31.291 --> 00:34:33.109
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

00:34:33.192 --> 00:34:35.418
Thor would do the same for us.

00:34:36.279 --> 00:34:37.817
Now shush.

00:34:39.385 --> 00:34:41.751
Heimdall might be watching.

00:34:46.759 --> 00:34:49.176
Heimdall demands your presence.

00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:55.139
We're doomed.

00:34:55.276 --> 00:34:59.080
You would defy the commands of Loki,
our king…

00:34:59.532 --> 00:35:01.874
break every oath you
have taken as warriors…

00:35:01.957 --> 00:35:04.580
and commit treason
to bring Thor back?

00:35:04.663 --> 00:35:06.109
- Yes.
- Good.

00:35:06.878 --> 00:35:08.058
So you'll help us?

00:35:08.141 --> 00:35:10.315
I am bound by honor to our king.

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:12.788
I cannot open the bridge to you.

00:35:13.318 --> 00:35:15.091
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

00:35:15.174 --> 00:35:16.656
Now what do we do?

00:35:18.204 --> 00:35:19.204
Look!

00:35:38.883 --> 00:35:39.709
What the hell was that?

00:35:39.792 --> 00:35:41.802
I don't know, sir. We got massive
energy readings out of nowhere…

00:35:41.885 --> 00:35:44.336
and then they just disappeared.
15 miles due northwest.

00:35:44.419 --> 00:35:45.723
Let's go take a look.

00:36:10.581 --> 00:36:11.833
Thank you.

00:36:11.916 --> 00:36:13.934
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:22.172
<i>Base to Team 2…</i>

00:36:22.255 --> 00:36:23.686
<i>we've got activity outside the town.</i>

00:36:23.769 --> 00:36:25.095
<i>Stay on your target.</i>

00:36:26.223 --> 00:36:27.719
<i>Query complete, sir.</i>

00:36:28.285 --> 00:36:30.603
<i>Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist…</i>

00:36:30.686 --> 00:36:33.741
<i>who defected to the United States
in 1963.</i>

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:37.944
<i>However, he was accused of espionage
and was deported in 1967.</i>

00:36:38.027 --> 00:36:40.446
<i>His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist…</i>

00:36:40.529 --> 00:36:45.097
<i>was convicted of selling Soviet-era
weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan…</i>

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.829
<i>and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.</i>

00:36:47.912 --> 00:36:50.171
<i>No further records exist.</i>

00:36:54.585 --> 00:36:55.411
Tony…

00:36:55.494 --> 00:36:58.366
you got to get upstairs and get
on top of this situation right now.

00:36:58.631 --> 00:36:59.696
Listen.

00:36:59.824 --> 00:37:02.886
I've been on the phone with
the National Guard all day…

00:37:02.969 --> 00:37:05.805
trying to talk them out
of rolling tanks up the PCH…

00:37:05.888 --> 00:37:08.808
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

00:37:08.891 --> 00:37:10.894
They're gonna take your suits, Tony, ok?

00:37:10.977 --> 00:37:12.433
They're sick of the games.

00:37:12.979 --> 00:37:16.158
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for 20 years.

00:37:16.241 --> 00:37:19.485
Well, guess what?
Somebody else had it yesterday.

00:37:19.568 --> 00:37:21.582
It's not theoretical any more.

00:37:23.114 --> 00:37:24.504
Are you listening to me?

00:37:27.284 --> 00:37:28.538
Are you ok?

00:37:29.834 --> 00:37:30.929
Let's go.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:34.494
Hey, man.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.050
Hey, hey!

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:40.383
- You alright?
- Yeah, I should get to my desk.

00:37:41.632 --> 00:37:43.236
- See that cigar box?
- Yeah.

00:37:44.135 --> 00:37:45.499
It's palladium.

00:37:52.768 --> 00:37:54.228
Is that supposed to be smoking?

00:37:54.311 --> 00:37:56.075
If you must know, it's neutron damage.

00:37:56.158 --> 00:37:58.165
It's from the reactor wall.

00:38:02.319 --> 00:38:04.020
You had this in your body?

00:38:09.285 --> 00:38:12.005
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

00:38:13.111 --> 00:38:14.325
Road rash.

00:38:18.002 --> 00:38:19.386
Thank you.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:31.879
What are you looking at?

00:38:31.962 --> 00:38:33.474
I'm looking at you.

00:38:34.277 --> 00:38:35.759
You wanna do this whole…

00:38:35.842 --> 00:38:38.355
lone gunslinger act
and it's unnecessary.

00:38:38.438 --> 00:38:39.449
You don't have to do this alone.

00:38:39.532 --> 00:38:40.778
You know, I wish I could believe that.

00:38:40.861 --> 00:38:41.785
I really do.

00:38:41.868 --> 00:38:43.580
But you've got to trust me.

00:38:44.204 --> 00:38:47.227
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

00:38:55.974 --> 00:38:58.950
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

00:38:59.033 --> 00:39:01.171
<i>Please wait for the all-clear.</i>

00:39:01.471 --> 00:39:02.892
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

00:39:03.321 --> 00:39:06.822
<i>All citizens shall remain
indoors until further notice.</i>

00:39:07.058 --> 00:39:10.418
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

00:39:18.072 --> 00:39:20.161
Dr. Erskine said that…

00:39:20.593 --> 00:39:23.043
the serum wouldn't
just affect my muscles…

00:39:23.126 --> 00:39:25.181
it would affect my cells.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:30.069
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

00:39:30.169 --> 00:39:31.497
Which means…

00:39:33.842 --> 00:39:35.590
I can't get drunk.

00:39:37.279 --> 00:39:38.729
Did you know that?

00:39:39.033 --> 00:39:43.469
Your metabolism burns four times
faster than the average person.

00:39:45.324 --> 00:39:47.529
He thought it could be
one of the side effects.

00:39:52.879 --> 00:39:54.646
It wasn't your fault.

00:39:56.122 --> 00:39:57.093
Did you read the report?

00:39:57.176 --> 00:39:58.359
Yes.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.221
Then you know that's not true.

00:40:00.304 --> 00:40:02.158
You did everything you could.

00:40:05.379 --> 00:40:07.387
Did you believe in your friend?

00:40:07.674 --> 00:40:09.306
Did you respect him?

00:40:10.597 --> 00:40:12.515
Then stop blaming yourself.

00:40:12.671 --> 00:40:15.132
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

00:40:15.328 --> 00:40:17.394
He damn well must have thought
you were worth it.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.526
I am going after Schmidt.

00:40:22.939 --> 00:40:26.191
I am not going to stop until all
of Hydra is dead or captured.

00:40:28.216 --> 00:40:29.796
You won't be alone.

00:40:43.851 --> 00:40:45.178
Mom?

00:40:53.404 --> 00:40:55.296
Is there a Renaissance Fair in town?

00:40:55.451 --> 00:40:56.692
Call it in.

00:40:57.156 --> 00:40:58.221
Yeah.

00:41:00.427 --> 00:41:02.190
Base, we've got Xena…

00:41:02.273 --> 00:41:04.013
Jackie Chan, and Robin Hood.

00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:06.496
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.424
But you won't be able to convince
the scientific community of any of it.

00:41:10.507 --> 00:41:12.150
Not without hard evidence.

00:41:13.131 --> 00:41:14.614
Found you!

00:41:20.351 --> 00:41:22.019
My friends!

00:41:23.307 --> 00:41:24.719
This is good!

00:41:24.802 --> 00:41:25.699
This is good.

00:41:25.782 --> 00:41:27.054
I don't believe it.

00:41:27.137 --> 00:41:28.321
Oh, excuse me.

00:41:28.404 --> 00:41:30.572
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

00:41:32.817 --> 00:41:34.155
My friends…

00:41:34.444 --> 00:41:37.039
I've never been happier to see anyone.

00:41:37.321 --> 00:41:39.123
But you should not have come.

00:41:41.032 --> 00:41:42.549
We're here to take you home.

00:41:43.778 --> 00:41:45.847
You know I can't go home.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.948
My father is…

00:41:50.369 --> 00:41:51.846
dead because of me.

00:41:52.336 --> 00:41:54.310
And I must remain in exile.

00:41:54.773 --> 00:41:55.773
Thor…

00:41:56.361 --> 00:41:58.491
your father still lives.

00:42:11.668 --> 00:42:14.471
Ensure my brother does not return.

00:42:18.008 --> 00:42:19.806
Destroy everything.

00:42:28.885 --> 00:42:31.322
Do you know which watch
you'd like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?

00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:32.819
I'll give them a look.

00:42:36.559 --> 00:42:38.228
I should cancel the party?

00:42:39.103 --> 00:42:40.355
Probably.
Yeah.

00:42:40.438 --> 00:42:41.703
Because it's…

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:42.990
I'll timed.

00:42:43.073 --> 00:42:44.588
Right, sends the wrong message.

00:42:44.671 --> 00:42:46.141
Inappropriate.

00:42:52.034 --> 00:42:53.691
Is that dirty enough for you?

00:42:55.291 --> 00:42:57.124
Gold face, brown band.

00:42:57.207 --> 00:42:59.345
The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.

00:42:59.584 --> 00:43:00.971
Bring them over here.

00:43:04.378 --> 00:43:05.429
I'll take that.

00:43:05.512 --> 00:43:06.966
Why don't you…

00:43:18.491 --> 00:43:21.021
I got to say it.
It's hard to get a read on you.

00:43:21.104 --> 00:43:22.259
Where are you from?

00:43:22.342 --> 00:43:23.581
Legal.

00:43:26.108 --> 00:43:28.005
Can I ask you a question,
hypothetically?

00:43:28.147 --> 00:43:29.207
Bit odd.

00:43:29.904 --> 00:43:31.575
If this was your last…

00:43:31.863 --> 00:43:34.979
birthday party you were ever gonna
have how would you celebrate it?

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.411
I'd do whatever I wanted to do…

00:43:39.839 --> 00:43:41.741
with whoever I wanted to do it with.

00:44:12.446 --> 00:44:13.568
Good evening.

00:44:13.715 --> 00:44:15.060
Good evening.

00:44:15.533 --> 00:44:17.239
Yes, sir, I understand.

00:44:17.939 --> 00:44:21.132
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

00:44:21.838 --> 00:44:24.233
Sir, I personally guarantee
that within 24 hours…

00:44:24.316 --> 00:44:26.038
Iron Man will be back on watch.

00:44:33.388 --> 00:44:34.670
Hey, Pepper.

00:44:35.178 --> 00:44:37.388
I'm. I'm. I'm going to go
get some air.

00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:38.562
What's wrong?

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.159
- I don't know what to do.
- You got to be kidding me.

00:44:48.149 --> 00:44:49.663
- That's it. I'm making--
- No, no, no.

00:44:49.746 --> 00:44:50.777
- Pepper…
- Don't call anyone.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:51.537
This is ridiculous.

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:52.921
- I just stuck my neck out for this guy.
- I know. I know.

00:44:53.004 --> 00:44:53.994
I know. I get it.

00:44:54.077 --> 00:44:55.567
I'm gonna handle it, ok?
Just let me handle it.

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:56.664
Handle it…

00:44:56.747 --> 00:44:58.423
or I'm gonna have to.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.310
You know, the question
I get asked most often is…

00:45:01.393 --> 00:45:03.355
Tony, how do you go
to the bathroom in the suit?

00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:08.412
Just like that.

00:45:12.381 --> 00:45:15.642
Does this guy know
how to throw a party or what?

00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:20.308
I love you.

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:21.738
Unbelievable!

00:45:21.821 --> 00:45:22.809
Thank you so much.

00:45:22.892 --> 00:45:26.854
Tony, we all thank you so much
for such a wonderful night.

00:45:26.937 --> 00:45:30.686
And we're gonna say good night now,
and thank you all for coming.

00:45:30.769 --> 00:45:32.277
No, no, no, we can't…
Wait, wait, wait.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.422
We didn't have the cake.
We didn't blow out the candles.

00:45:34.505 --> 00:45:36.828
You're out of control, ok?
Trust me on this one, ok?

00:45:36.911 --> 00:45:39.387
- You're out of control, gorgeous.
- It's time to go to bed. It's time.

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:40.648
- Give me another smooch.
- You're not going to be happy about this.

00:45:40.731 --> 00:45:41.870
Come on, you know you want to.

00:45:41.953 --> 00:45:43.371
You just peed the suit.

00:45:43.454 --> 00:45:45.112
- I know. It has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

00:45:45.195 --> 00:45:46.552
You could drink that water.

00:45:46.874 --> 00:45:49.682
Just send everybody home, ok?
It's time to.

00:45:50.211 --> 00:45:51.957
- If you say so.
- Ok.

00:45:52.046 --> 00:45:54.514
I'll take this, you take that.

00:45:55.505 --> 00:45:56.899
Pepper Potts.

00:45:58.552 --> 00:46:00.054
She's right. The party's over.

00:46:00.137 --> 00:46:03.141
Then again the party was over for me,
like an hour and a half ago.

00:46:03.224 --> 00:46:06.922
The after party starts in 15 minutes.

00:46:10.272 --> 00:46:11.310
And if anybody…

00:46:11.393 --> 00:46:13.304
Pepper, doesn't like it…

00:46:13.387 --> 00:46:14.893
there is the door.

00:46:20.908 --> 00:46:22.583
Yeah!

00:46:26.664 --> 00:46:28.000
Hit!

00:46:34.956 --> 00:46:36.196
Pull!

00:46:55.776 --> 00:46:58.244
I think she wants the Gallagher!

00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:09.109
I'm only gonna say this once.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.080
Get out.

00:47:20.551 --> 00:47:22.295
You don't deserve
to wear one of these.

00:47:22.378 --> 00:47:23.685
Shut it down!

00:47:25.264 --> 00:47:26.509
Goldstein.

00:47:27.683 --> 00:47:28.893
Yes, Mr Stark?

00:47:28.976 --> 00:47:31.972
Give me a phat beat
to beat my buddy's ass to.

00:47:36.025 --> 00:47:38.157
I told you to shut it down.

00:47:48.537 --> 00:47:52.031
Now, put that thing back where
you found it before someone gets hurt.

00:47:58.839 --> 00:48:00.071
Really?

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:08.912
Sorry pal…

00:48:08.995 --> 00:48:11.692
but Iron Man
doesn't have a sidekick.

00:48:12.061 --> 00:48:13.775
Sidekick…

00:48:13.858 --> 00:48:14.858
this!

00:48:22.822 --> 00:48:24.145
Had enough?

00:48:25.241 --> 00:48:26.513
- Natalie!
- Miss Potts.

00:48:26.596 --> 00:48:28.911
Don't you Miss Potts me!
I'm on to you.

00:48:28.994 --> 00:48:30.978
You know what?
Ever since you came here…

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:35.893
Pepper!

00:48:37.336 --> 00:48:38.970
Get out of here. Get out of here.

00:48:44.927 --> 00:48:46.055
You want it?

00:48:46.381 --> 00:48:47.496
Take it!

00:49:28.929 --> 00:49:30.139
Put your hand down.

00:49:30.222 --> 00:49:32.350
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

00:49:32.516 --> 00:49:33.955
We don't have to do this, Tony.

00:49:34.038 --> 00:49:35.802
You wanna be the War Machine,
take your shot.

00:49:35.885 --> 00:49:37.606
Put it down!
You gonna take a shot?

00:49:37.689 --> 00:49:39.023
Put it down!
No!

00:49:39.106 --> 00:49:40.865
- Drop it, Tony!
- Take it.

00:50:51.595 --> 00:50:54.015
Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant
Colonel James Rhodes…

00:50:54.098 --> 00:50:57.293
inbound from three miles east
at 5,000 feet…

00:51:41.494 --> 00:51:42.672
Colonel.

00:51:43.819 --> 00:51:45.153
Major.

00:51:48.258 --> 00:51:49.492
Yeah.

00:51:51.488 --> 00:51:52.981
Let's take it inside.

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:54.894
Clear the area.

00:52:17.765 --> 00:52:18.819
Sir!

00:52:19.058 --> 00:52:21.678
I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the doughnut.

00:52:25.423 --> 00:52:28.010
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

00:52:28.484 --> 00:52:32.175
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

00:52:32.283 --> 00:52:33.514
How's that working out for you?

00:52:33.597 --> 00:52:35.533
It's… It's… It's…

00:52:36.974 --> 00:52:38.437
I'm sorry. I don't wanna
get off on the wrong foot.

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.162
Do I look at the patch or the eye?

00:52:41.413 --> 00:52:42.481
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

00:52:42.564 --> 00:52:44.917
I'm not sure if you're real
or if I'm having…

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.023
I am very real.

00:52:47.106 --> 00:52:49.407
I'm the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

00:52:49.671 --> 00:52:51.437
Just my luck.
Where's the staff here?

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.248
That's not looking so good.

00:52:53.714 --> 00:52:55.790
I've been worse.

00:52:57.346 --> 00:52:58.389
We've secured the perimeter…

00:52:58.472 --> 00:53:00.823
but I don't think we should
hold it for too much longer.

00:53:04.937 --> 00:53:06.679
You're fired.

00:53:06.802 --> 00:53:08.251
That's not up to you.

00:53:08.482 --> 00:53:09.530
Tony…

00:53:10.381 --> 00:53:11.694
I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.

00:53:11.777 --> 00:53:13.016
- Hi.
- I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

00:53:13.099 --> 00:53:15.694
Once we knew you were ill,
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

00:53:15.777 --> 00:53:17.441
I suggest you apologise.

00:53:17.616 --> 00:53:19.065
You've been very busy.

00:53:19.243 --> 00:53:22.496
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

00:53:22.579 --> 00:53:25.583
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

00:53:25.666 --> 00:53:27.043
Now, if I didn't know better…

00:53:27.126 --> 00:53:29.746
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.

00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:31.881
He took it?

00:53:31.964 --> 00:53:35.176
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

00:53:35.259 --> 00:53:38.136
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

00:53:38.219 --> 00:53:39.353
Is that possible?

00:53:39.436 --> 00:53:42.058
Well, according to Mr Stark's
database security guidelines…

00:53:42.141 --> 00:53:45.228
there are redundancies
to prevent unauthorised usage.

00:53:47.883 --> 00:53:50.503
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you? No, no, no…

00:53:50.586 --> 00:53:52.526
What do you want from me?

00:53:52.609 --> 00:53:56.280
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

00:53:56.363 --> 00:53:57.255
Contrary to your belief…

00:53:57.338 --> 00:53:59.617
- …you are not the center of my universe.
- Yeah I know.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.674
I have bigger problems than you
in the southwest region to deal with.

00:54:02.757 --> 00:54:03.788
Hit him.

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.510
Oh God, are you gonna…

00:54:06.617 --> 00:54:08.571
steal my kidney and sell it?

00:54:08.876 --> 00:54:10.278
Could you please not do anything…

00:54:10.361 --> 00:54:12.134
awful for five seconds?

00:54:12.379 --> 00:54:13.478
What did she just do to me?

00:54:13.561 --> 00:54:15.976
What did we just do for you?

00:54:16.091 --> 00:54:17.418
That's lithium dioxide.

00:54:17.501 --> 00:54:18.440
It's gonna take the edge off.

00:54:18.523 --> 00:54:20.340
We're trying to get you back to work.

00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:22.650
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

00:54:22.733 --> 00:54:24.570
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms.

00:54:24.653 --> 00:54:26.995
Doesn't look like it's gonna be
an easy fix.

00:54:27.311 --> 00:54:29.477
Trust me, I know.
I'm good at this stuff.

00:54:29.605 --> 00:54:31.982
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

00:54:32.065 --> 00:54:33.743
I've tried every combination…

00:54:33.826 --> 00:54:36.330
every permutation
of every known element.

00:54:36.413 --> 00:54:37.772
Well, I'm here to tell you…

00:54:37.855 --> 00:54:39.617
you haven't tried them all.

00:54:51.686 --> 00:54:55.023
Tell me Loki,
how did you get the Jotuns into Asgarol?

00:54:55.106 --> 00:54:58.289
You think the Bifrost is the only way
in and out of this realm?

00:54:58.372 --> 00:54:59.986
There are secret paths
between the worlds…

00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:02.703
to which even you, with all your gifts,
are blind.

00:55:02.786 --> 00:55:06.034
But I have need of them no longer,
now that I am king.

00:55:06.117 --> 00:55:07.994
And I say, for your act of treason…

00:55:08.077 --> 00:55:10.830
you are relieved of your duties
as Gatekeeper…

00:55:10.913 --> 00:55:12.965
and no longer citizen of Asgard.

00:55:13.061 --> 00:55:15.508
Then I need no longer obey you.

00:55:36.365 --> 00:55:38.508
Get somebody from Linguistics
down here.

00:56:06.469 --> 00:56:08.331
Was somebody else coming?

00:56:12.391 --> 00:56:13.435
Is that one of Stark's?

00:56:13.518 --> 00:56:14.740
I don't know.

00:56:14.823 --> 00:56:17.179
The guy never tells me anything.

00:56:20.816 --> 00:56:22.055
Hello.

00:56:22.151 --> 00:56:25.011
You are using
unregistered weapons technology.

00:56:25.094 --> 00:56:26.676
Identify yourself

00:56:30.195 --> 00:56:31.496
Here we go.

00:56:34.455 --> 00:56:35.927
Incoming!
