00:00:49.147 --> 00:00:50.707
Are you the guys
from Washington?

00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:52.627
You get many other
visitors out here?

00:00:52.707 --> 00:00:54.267
How long you been on-site?

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.747
Since this morning.

00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:58.507
A Russian oil team called
it in about 18 hours ago.

00:00:58.707 --> 00:01:01.067
How come nobody
spotted it before?

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:02.867
It's really not that surprising.

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:05.507
This landscape's
changing all the time.

00:01:05.547 --> 00:01:07.427
You got any idea what
this thing is exactly?

00:01:07.507 --> 00:01:09.587
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:11.067
I don't think so.

00:01:11.107 --> 00:01:13.187
You know, we don't have the
equipment for a job like this.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:15.907
How long before we
can start craning it out?

00:01:16.187 --> 00:01:17.907
I don't think you
quite understand.

00:01:18.227 --> 00:01:20.947
You guys are gonna
need one hell of a crane.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.427
Base, we're in.

00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:16.867
What is this?

00:02:32.147 --> 00:02:33.307
Careful.

00:02:54.147 --> 00:02:55.507
Lieutenant!

00:02:58.587 --> 00:02:59.907
What is it?

00:03:00.227 --> 00:03:01.587
My God.

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:04.347
Base, get me a
line to the Colonel.

00:03:05.027 --> 00:03:06.507
It's 3:00 a.m., sir.

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:11.187
I don't care what time it is.
This one's waited long enough.

00:03:54.024 --> 00:03:56.624
Hey, there he is.
It's the bird man.

00:03:58.584 --> 00:04:01.304
Now you like the bird.
Is that right?

00:04:01.384 --> 00:04:03.824
Is that your bird?
I'm confused.

00:04:04.784 --> 00:04:08.144
You said it wasn't, but now it
looks like you're best of pals.

00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:10.344
You love that bird, don't you?

00:04:10.424 --> 00:04:12.304
You know what?
Take the bird.

00:04:13.824 --> 00:04:15.064
Hey!

00:04:17.144 --> 00:04:19.824
Take his pillows, too.
Both of them.

00:04:21.064 --> 00:04:23.024
And his shoes.
Take his shoes.

00:04:27.064 --> 00:04:30.464
I took your stuff.
How does that make you feel?

00:04:31.064 --> 00:04:33.904
Do you feel bad?
Good.

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.944
'Cause that's how I feel!

00:04:37.384 --> 00:04:39.264
We had a contract!

00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:41.664
I saved your life

00:04:42.424 --> 00:04:44.424
and you give me suits.

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:48.864
That was our deal.
And you did not deliver.

00:04:49.704 --> 00:04:54.184
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.

00:04:56.544 --> 00:04:59.864
Something really, really
great fell into my lap.

00:05:00.464 --> 00:05:03.704
And if it hadn't, I'd be
at your mercy tonight.

00:05:03.944 --> 00:05:07.744
Now I have a piece of Stark
tech that I pimped out myself.

00:05:07.984 --> 00:05:09.744
And now your
overpriced paperweights

00:05:09.824 --> 00:05:12.424
are gonna look like a
backdrop to my demonstration.

00:05:12.904 --> 00:05:14.864
Do you dig what
I'm getting at here?

00:05:17.144 --> 00:05:18.984
I don't know if you know this,

00:05:19.064 --> 00:05:21.624
but I don't speak Russian!

00:05:25.064 --> 00:05:26.944
I'm gonna leave now.

00:05:27.024 --> 00:05:30.104
I'm gonna go to the Expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:32.704
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.

00:05:32.864 --> 00:05:35.344
They are not to be trifled with.

00:05:35.744 --> 00:05:40.064
When I get back, we're gonna
renegotiate the terms of our agreement.

00:05:40.624 --> 00:05:42.704
And you're gonna make
good on our arrangement

00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:44.344
because if you don't,

00:05:44.464 --> 00:05:46.864
you're gonna be exactly what
you were when I found you,

00:05:46.944 --> 00:05:48.624
a dead man.

00:05:48.704 --> 00:05:50.104
You got that?

00:05:51.064 --> 00:05:53.424
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

00:06:02.784 --> 00:06:04.384
Dummy, you, can we
clean up this mess?

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:06.184
You're killing me.
You know I don't...

00:06:06.264 --> 00:06:08.544
<i>Incoming call with a
blocked number, sir.</i>

00:06:08.624 --> 00:06:11.864
My phone privilege
is reinstated. Lovely.

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:13.384
Coulson. How's the
Land of Enchantment?

00:06:13.464 --> 00:06:17.304
<i>Hey, Tony, how you doing?</i>

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:18.744
<i>I double cycle.</i>

00:06:18.824 --> 00:06:19.824
You what?

00:06:20.824 --> 00:06:24.664
You told me double cycle's more power.
Good advice.

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:26.704
You sound pretty
sprightly for a dead guy.

00:06:26.784 --> 00:06:28.984
<i>You, too.</i>

00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:32.184
- Trace him.
<i>- Sir.</i>

00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:36.024
Now, the true history of
Stark name will be written.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:37.184
Jarvis, where is he?

00:06:37.264 --> 00:06:39.824
<i>Accessing the Oracle grid.</i>

00:06:39.904 --> 00:06:41.424
<i>Eastern Seaboard.</i>

00:06:41.504 --> 00:06:45.624
What your father did to
my family over 40 years,

00:06:46.464 --> 00:06:49.104
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:51.184
Sounds good.
Let's get together and hash it out.

00:06:51.504 --> 00:06:55.184
<i>Tri-State area.
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.</i>

00:06:55.264 --> 00:06:57.184
I hope you're ready.

00:06:59.944 --> 00:07:01.944
<i>Call trace incomplete.</i>

00:07:12.504 --> 00:07:13.504
<i>Sir...</i>

00:07:13.584 --> 00:07:15.144
You want to run
some tests, run them.

00:07:16.184 --> 00:07:18.144
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.

00:07:18.224 --> 00:07:19.384
<i>We are unclear
as to the effects...</i>

00:07:19.464 --> 00:07:20.624
I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

00:07:25.064 --> 00:07:27.144
That tastes like coconut.

00:07:27.224 --> 00:07:28.904
And metal.

00:07:29.224 --> 00:07:30.824
Oh, wow, yeah!

00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:36.121
<i>Heimdall!</i>

00:07:36.965 --> 00:07:40.238
<i>Heimdall!
If you can hear me, we need you now!</i>

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:43.349
<i>Heimdall! We need you now!</i>

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.510
Heimdall!

00:08:03.214 --> 00:08:05.294
Get him to the healing room!

00:08:06.734 --> 00:08:08.294
Leave my brother to me.

00:08:33.134 --> 00:08:34.654
It's said

00:08:34.974 --> 00:08:39.654
you can still hear and see
what transpires around you.

00:08:40.974 --> 00:08:43.174
I hope it's true,

00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:47.174
so that you may know

00:08:48.174 --> 00:08:52.134
your death came at the hand

00:08:53.014 --> 00:08:54.334
of Laufey.

00:09:03.454 --> 00:09:05.974
And your death came
by the son of Odin.

00:09:11.854 --> 00:09:13.254
Loki!

00:09:13.294 --> 00:09:14.814
You saved him!

00:09:19.334 --> 00:09:21.614
I swear to you, Mother,

00:09:21.654 --> 00:09:24.174
that they will pay for
what they've done today.

00:09:24.494 --> 00:09:25.534
Loki.

00:09:26.334 --> 00:09:27.374
Thor!

00:09:28.374 --> 00:09:30.334
I knew you'd return to us.

00:09:35.854 --> 00:09:37.334
Why don't you tell her

00:09:37.534 --> 00:09:41.054
how you sent the Destroyer
to kill our friends, to kill me?

00:09:41.174 --> 00:09:42.174
What?

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:44.694
Why, it must have been
enforcing Father's last command.

00:09:44.734 --> 00:09:47.654
You're a talented liar, Brother.
Always have been.

00:09:48.214 --> 00:09:49.534
It's good to have you back.

00:09:49.894 --> 00:09:53.534
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to destroy Jotunheim.

00:10:35.054 --> 00:10:36.414
You can't stop it.

00:10:36.534 --> 00:10:39.854
The Bifrost will build until
it rips Jotunheim apart.

00:11:01.768 --> 00:11:02.968
Jane?

00:11:13.877 --> 00:11:15.757
I'll keep the car
down here, all right?

00:11:15.837 --> 00:11:17.157
Thank you, Happy.

00:11:17.237 --> 00:11:18.397
<i>...Justin Hammer.</i>

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:21.997
<i>His presentation will begin
shortly in the main pavilion.</i>

00:11:40.437 --> 00:11:41.717
Yeah!

00:11:42.837 --> 00:11:46.197
That's what I'm talking about.
Thanks for coming.

00:11:46.757 --> 00:11:48.757
Ladies and gentlemen,
for far too long,

00:11:48.837 --> 00:11:53.397
this country has had to place its
brave men and women in harm's way,

00:11:53.557 --> 00:11:55.197
but then the Iron Man arrived,

00:11:55.277 --> 00:11:58.957
and we thought the days of
losing lives were behind us.

00:11:59.757 --> 00:12:02.517
Sadly, that technology
was kept out of reach.

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:04.917
That's not fair.
That's not right.

00:12:04.997 --> 00:12:06.117
And it's just too bad.

00:12:06.197 --> 00:12:07.237
Oh, Lord.

00:12:07.317 --> 00:12:09.397
Regardless, it was an
impressive innovation,

00:12:09.477 --> 00:12:12.437
one that grabbed
headlines the world over.

00:12:12.797 --> 00:12:14.397
Well, today, my friends,

00:12:14.517 --> 00:12:17.957
the press is faced with
quite a different problem.

00:12:18.477 --> 00:12:20.957
They are about
to run out of ink.

00:12:26.517 --> 00:12:27.597
Get that out of here.

00:12:29.477 --> 00:12:31.317
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:12:32.357 --> 00:12:34.877
today I present to you

00:12:34.997 --> 00:12:38.197
the new face of the
United States military.

00:12:39.597 --> 00:12:40.837
The Hammer drone!

00:12:43.437 --> 00:12:44.837
Army!

00:12:57.997 --> 00:12:59.117
Navy!

00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:10.517
Air Force!

00:13:18.677 --> 00:13:20.037
Marines!

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:35.317
Yeah! Yeah!
Whoo!

00:13:37.997 --> 00:13:40.877
That's a hell of a lot better than
some cheerleaders, let me tell you.

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:45.117
But as revolutionary
as this technology is,

00:13:45.197 --> 00:13:46.717
there will always
be a need for man

00:13:46.797 --> 00:13:48.877
to be present in
the theater of war.

00:13:49.517 --> 00:13:52.517
Ladies and gentlemen, today
I am proud to present to you

00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:57.757
the very first prototype in the
Variable Threat Response Battle Suit

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:01.677
and its pilot, Air Force
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.

00:14:03.237 --> 00:14:04.437
What?

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:28.637
For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries is reporting for...

00:14:45.597 --> 00:14:47.317
We got trouble.

00:14:47.397 --> 00:14:49.077
Tony, there are
civilians present.

00:14:49.157 --> 00:14:51.837
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

00:14:51.917 --> 00:14:53.197
Give them a wave.

00:14:53.277 --> 00:14:55.357
Hey, all right! Yeah!

00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:56.437
All these people are in danger.

00:14:56.517 --> 00:14:57.517
We gotta get them out of here.

00:14:57.637 --> 00:14:59.677
You gotta trust me for
the next five minutes.

00:14:59.757 --> 00:15:01.837
Yeah, I tried that.
I got tossed around your house, remember?

00:15:01.917 --> 00:15:03.917
Listen, I think he's
working with Vanko.

00:15:03.997 --> 00:15:05.637
Vanko's alive?

00:15:05.997 --> 00:15:07.997
Huh? Yeah!

00:15:08.077 --> 00:15:09.317
Where is he?

00:15:09.717 --> 00:15:10.717
What?

00:15:10.797 --> 00:15:11.797
Where's Vanko?

00:15:12.157 --> 00:15:14.037
- Who?
- Tell me.

00:15:14.117 --> 00:15:16.117
What are you doing here, man?

00:15:16.197 --> 00:15:17.837
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:15:22.117 --> 00:15:23.117
Is that you?

00:15:23.197 --> 00:15:24.637
- No, I'm not doing that.
- That's not me.

00:15:25.757 --> 00:15:28.437
I can't move.
I'm locked up. I'm locked up!

00:15:29.197 --> 00:15:31.357
Get out of here. Go!
This whole system's been compromised.

00:15:32.757 --> 00:15:34.677
Let's take it outside.

00:15:46.837 --> 00:15:48.037
No. No!

00:15:57.997 --> 00:15:59.757
Jarvis, break in.
I need to own him.

00:15:59.837 --> 00:16:01.277
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:16:03.117 --> 00:16:06.037
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

00:16:06.117 --> 00:16:07.717
- On what?
- On you!

00:16:12.757 --> 00:16:14.597
Tony, on your six!

00:16:31.917 --> 00:16:32.997
What's going on?
What's happening?

00:16:33.077 --> 00:16:34.277
The software's been overridden.

00:16:34.397 --> 00:16:35.637
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

00:16:35.717 --> 00:16:36.997
What does that mean?
I think he slaved the drones.

00:16:37.077 --> 00:16:38.797
That's impossible.
Call the guards.

00:16:38.877 --> 00:16:39.957
All the phones are down, sir.

00:16:40.037 --> 00:16:42.197
- Well, then call their...
- Call their cells.

00:16:42.277 --> 00:16:43.797
Their cell phones are
not working, either, sir.

00:16:43.877 --> 00:16:45.117
He's locked us out
of the mainframe.

00:16:45.197 --> 00:16:46.397
Who's locked you
out of the mainframe?

00:16:46.477 --> 00:16:48.037
Please, please, go away.
Go away.

00:16:48.117 --> 00:16:49.477
- I've got this handled.
- Have you now?

00:16:49.557 --> 00:16:50.637
Yes, I do.

00:16:50.717 --> 00:16:53.197
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up,
this wouldn't be happening.

00:16:53.277 --> 00:16:55.637
So please, now go away.
Thank you.

00:16:56.077 --> 00:16:58.397
Listen, we got to get
these bitches out of here.

00:16:58.557 --> 00:17:00.037
What?

00:17:00.117 --> 00:17:03.477
You tell me who's behind this.
Who's behind this?

00:17:03.557 --> 00:17:06.077
Ivan.
Ivan Vanko.

00:17:06.517 --> 00:17:07.477
Where is he?

00:17:07.597 --> 00:17:09.077
He's at my facility.

00:17:12.437 --> 00:17:14.077
- I need NYPD, please.
- No, no, no!

00:17:14.157 --> 00:17:15.357
- Command Central.
- No, no, honey.

00:17:15.437 --> 00:17:17.357
- Don't call the authorities.
- Okay. Right away. Right away.

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:19.477
Step aside.
Step aside.

00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:21.944
Tell me everything
you know. Go.

00:17:28.292 --> 00:17:29.772
Why have you done this?

00:17:30.052 --> 00:17:33.772
To prove to Father
that I am the worthy son.

00:17:33.892 --> 00:17:36.732
When he wakes, I
will have saved his life.

00:17:36.772 --> 00:17:39.532
I will have destroyed
that race of monsters.

00:17:39.572 --> 00:17:42.012
And I will be true
heir to the throne!

00:17:42.092 --> 00:17:44.092
You can't kill an entire race!

00:17:44.212 --> 00:17:45.532
Why not?

00:17:48.292 --> 00:17:51.572
And what is this newfound
love for the Frost Giants?

00:17:52.612 --> 00:17:55.972
You could have killed them
all with your bare hands.

00:17:56.092 --> 00:17:57.092
I've changed.

00:17:57.172 --> 00:17:58.212
So have I.

00:17:59.932 --> 00:18:01.452
Now fight me.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.292
I never wanted the throne!

00:18:07.612 --> 00:18:09.572
I only ever wanted
to be your equal.

00:18:10.292 --> 00:18:12.292
I will not fight you, Brother!

00:18:12.332 --> 00:18:13.772
I'm not your brother.

00:18:14.492 --> 00:18:15.772
I never was.

00:18:15.892 --> 00:18:17.412
Loki, this is madness.

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:19.612
Is it madness?

00:18:20.452 --> 00:18:21.612
Is it?

00:18:23.012 --> 00:18:24.292
Is it?

00:18:25.332 --> 00:18:29.332
Come on. What happened to you
on Earth that turned you so soft?

00:18:29.897 --> 00:18:32.617
Don't tell me it was that woman.

00:18:32.928 --> 00:18:34.088
Oh!

00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:36.029
It was!

00:18:36.132 --> 00:18:40.732
Well, maybe, when we're finished
here, I'll pay her a visit myself!

00:19:22.409 --> 00:19:24.289
Thor!

00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:32.741
Brother, please.

00:19:43.878 --> 00:19:45.038
Enough!

00:20:29.134 --> 00:20:30.294
Look at you,

00:20:32.924 --> 00:20:34.244
the Mighty Thor,

00:20:37.364 --> 00:20:39.564
with all your strength,

00:20:40.336 --> 00:20:43.016
and what good does
it do you now, huh?

00:20:44.204 --> 00:20:47.964
Do you hear me, Brother?
There's nothing you can do!

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:07.284
What are you doing?

00:21:08.964 --> 00:21:12.324
If you destroy the bridge,
you'll never see her again!

00:21:21.964 --> 00:21:23.644
Forgive me, Jane.

00:22:02.164 --> 00:22:04.164
I could have done it, Father!

00:22:05.164 --> 00:22:07.004
I could have done it!

00:22:07.404 --> 00:22:08.724
For you!

00:22:09.484 --> 00:22:10.964
For all of us!

00:22:13.164 --> 00:22:14.484
No, Loki.

00:22:23.204 --> 00:22:24.204
Loki, no.

00:22:25.484 --> 00:22:27.644
No!

00:22:31.884 --> 00:22:33.044
No.

00:22:51.849 --> 00:22:53.009
How are we doing, Jarvis?

00:22:53.089 --> 00:22:54.849
<i>Remote reboot unsuccessful.</i>

00:23:12.329 --> 00:23:13.849
This way.

00:23:14.489 --> 00:23:16.369
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?

00:23:16.449 --> 00:23:18.729
Get in the car.
Take me to Hammer Industries.

00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:19.969
I'm not taking you anywhere.

00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:21.209
Fine. You want me to drive?

00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:23.809
No, I'm driving.
Get in the car.

00:24:22.289 --> 00:24:23.449
Nice work, kid.

00:24:25.517 --> 00:24:27.197
<i>You got multiples
coming in on you.</i>

00:24:27.277 --> 00:24:28.877
Let's get this away
from the Expo.

00:24:34.314 --> 00:24:36.754
When we arrive, I need
you to watch the perimeter.

00:24:36.834 --> 00:24:40.474
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

00:24:42.754 --> 00:24:44.314
Watch the road.
I got it. I got it.

00:25:15.794 --> 00:25:17.714
Listen, listen.
A pack just peeled off.

00:25:17.794 --> 00:25:18.954
They're headed back to the Expo.

00:25:19.034 --> 00:25:20.394
Got it.

00:25:24.154 --> 00:25:25.674
I'm closing on you.

00:25:25.754 --> 00:25:28.114
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony.
Watch it.

00:25:43.994 --> 00:25:45.114
Stay in the car.

00:25:45.194 --> 00:25:46.674
I'm not staying in the car.

00:25:46.754 --> 00:25:48.314
I said, stay in the car.

00:25:48.474 --> 00:25:50.474
What are you wearing?

00:25:51.754 --> 00:25:53.314
Look, I'm not letting
you go in there alone.

00:25:54.474 --> 00:25:55.554
You want to help?
Keep the car running.

00:25:55.634 --> 00:25:56.714
Okay.

00:26:00.434 --> 00:26:01.914
Hey, hey, hey.
You can't come in here.

00:26:03.154 --> 00:26:04.714
Hold on. Hey!

00:26:49.434 --> 00:26:51.354
Each set of drones
is communicating

00:26:51.474 --> 00:26:52.474
in its own unique language.

00:26:52.554 --> 00:26:54.194
Well, choose one
and focus on that.

00:26:54.314 --> 00:26:56.314
Have you tried Russian?
Why don't you try Russian?

00:26:59.754 --> 00:27:02.314
<i>Attention. We have
intrusion on Grid W.</i>

00:27:02.394 --> 00:27:04.674
- We got it.
- We're on our way.

00:27:45.034 --> 00:27:47.154
I got him!

00:28:02.354 --> 00:28:03.354
Rhodey, you still locked on?

00:28:03.434 --> 00:28:04.434
Yeah.

00:28:04.514 --> 00:28:06.234
Drop your socks
and grab your Crocs.

00:28:06.314 --> 00:28:07.994
We're about to
get wet on this ride.

00:28:10.154 --> 00:28:11.274
Wait, wait, wait!

00:28:30.874 --> 00:28:32.714
He's gone.

00:28:36.394 --> 00:28:38.434
I'm sorry, buddy.
Had to thin out the herd.

00:28:39.234 --> 00:28:40.394
What's your 20?

00:28:52.674 --> 00:28:53.754
What are you doing?

00:28:53.834 --> 00:28:55.514
I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

00:29:01.914 --> 00:29:02.954
Tony!

00:29:19.474 --> 00:29:23.554
Reboot complete.
You got your best friend back.

00:29:23.634 --> 00:29:25.594
<i>Thank you very
much, Agent Romanoff.</i>

00:29:25.674 --> 00:29:27.034
Well done with the
new chest piece.

00:29:27.114 --> 00:29:28.754
I am reading
significantly higher output

00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:30.794
and your vitals
all look promising.

00:29:30.874 --> 00:29:33.594
<i>Yes, for the moment,
I'm not dying. Thank you.</i>

00:29:33.674 --> 00:29:34.674
<i>What do you mean
you're not dying?</i>

00:29:34.754 --> 00:29:35.794
<i>Did you just say you're dying?</i>

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:38.114
<i>Is that you? No, I'm not.
Not anymore.</i>

00:29:38.194 --> 00:29:39.434
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:29:39.514 --> 00:29:41.074
<i>I was going to tell you.
I didn't want to alarm you.</i>

00:29:41.154 --> 00:29:42.674
<i>You were gonna tell me?
You really were dying?</i>

00:29:42.754 --> 00:29:44.514
<i>- You didn't let me.
- Why didn't you tell me that?</i>

00:29:44.594 --> 00:29:47.354
<i>I was gonna make you
an omelet and tell you.</i>

00:29:47.434 --> 00:29:50.394
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

00:29:50.474 --> 00:29:52.074
Looks like the
fight's coming to you.

00:29:52.154 --> 00:29:53.994
<i>- Great. Pepper?</i>
<i>- Are you okay now?</i>

00:29:54.074 --> 00:29:55.274
<i>I am fine. Don't be mad.</i>

00:29:55.354 --> 00:29:56.954
<i>- I will formally apologize...
- I am mad!</i>

00:29:57.034 --> 00:29:59.994
<i>...when I'm not fending
off a Hammeroid attack.</i>

00:30:00.074 --> 00:30:01.674
<i>- Fine.
- We could have been in Venice.</i>

00:30:01.754 --> 00:30:02.914
<i>Oh, please.</i>

00:30:05.634 --> 00:30:07.074
Rhodes?

00:30:07.794 --> 00:30:09.594
Snap out of it, buddy.
I need you.

00:30:11.234 --> 00:30:12.474
They're coming.
Come on, let's roll.

00:30:12.554 --> 00:30:13.714
Get up.

00:30:16.834 --> 00:30:18.954
Oh, man.
You can have your suit back.

00:30:22.474 --> 00:30:23.794
You okay?

00:30:23.954 --> 00:30:25.554
Yeah, thanks.

00:30:27.074 --> 00:30:28.394
Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?

00:30:28.474 --> 00:30:29.514
Don't be.

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:30.794
No. I should have
trusted you more.

00:30:30.874 --> 00:30:32.474
I'm the one who put you
in this position. Forget it.

00:30:32.554 --> 00:30:34.874
No. It's your fault.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

00:30:34.954 --> 00:30:37.034
Thank you.
That's all I wanted to hear.

00:30:37.114 --> 00:30:38.434
Partner.

00:30:38.514 --> 00:30:42.114
They're coming in hot, any second.
What's the play?

00:30:42.714 --> 00:30:44.354
Well, we want to take
the high ground, okay?

00:30:44.434 --> 00:30:46.034
So let's put the biggest
gun up on that ridge.

00:30:46.114 --> 00:30:47.394
Got you.

00:30:48.234 --> 00:30:49.314
- Where do you want to be?
- Where are you going?

00:30:49.394 --> 00:30:51.034
- What're you talking about?
- I meant me.

00:30:51.114 --> 00:30:53.114
You have a big gun.
You are not the big gun.

00:30:53.194 --> 00:30:54.554
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No. It's subtle,

00:30:54.674 --> 00:30:55.834
all the bells and whistles.

00:30:55.914 --> 00:30:57.074
Yeah. It's called
being a badass.

00:30:57.154 --> 00:30:58.394
Fine.

00:30:59.114 --> 00:31:02.514
All right. You go up top.
I'll draw them in.

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:04.474
Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.

00:31:04.554 --> 00:31:05.794
Okay, you got a spot.
Where's mine?

00:31:05.874 --> 00:31:08.794
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.

00:31:58.514 --> 00:31:59.994
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah, nice.

00:32:08.314 --> 00:32:09.554
Rhodey?

00:32:10.914 --> 00:32:12.394
Get down.

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:25.114
Wow. I think you should
lead with that next time.

00:32:25.194 --> 00:32:28.554
Yeah. Sorry, boss.
I can only use it once. It's a one-off.

00:32:30.954 --> 00:32:33.114
I told you that
five minutes ago.

00:32:34.434 --> 00:32:35.834
That's your guy here.

00:32:37.114 --> 00:32:38.154
Excuse me?

00:32:38.234 --> 00:32:39.234
You're being
placed under arrest.

00:32:39.314 --> 00:32:40.714
- Are you kidding me?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

00:32:40.794 --> 00:32:42.434
I'm trying to help here.

00:32:45.034 --> 00:32:48.194
I get it.
I see what you're doing.

00:32:48.274 --> 00:32:51.754
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?
That's good. That's good.

00:32:51.874 --> 00:32:53.434
You're starting to
think like a CEO,

00:32:53.514 --> 00:32:55.914
taking out the
competition. I like that.

00:32:55.994 --> 00:32:57.354
You think you're making
a problem for me?

00:32:57.434 --> 00:32:58.554
I'm gonna make
a problem for you.

00:32:58.634 --> 00:33:01.634
I'm gonna be seeing
you again real soon.

00:33:05.834 --> 00:33:07.354
When they get here,
I think you should station them

00:33:07.434 --> 00:33:10.194
at the south, east
and both west exits.

00:33:10.314 --> 00:33:12.434
We shut down the 7 train in
and out of Willets Point already.

00:33:12.514 --> 00:33:15.314
Well, have city buses there to
ferry people to operating lines.

00:33:15.394 --> 00:33:16.874
Yeah.
Are you coming with us?

00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:18.874
No, I'm gonna stay
till the park is clear.

00:33:18.954 --> 00:33:20.434
Okay.

00:33:22.234 --> 00:33:24.714
Heads up.
You got one more drone incoming.

00:33:24.834 --> 00:33:26.194
This one looks different.

00:33:26.594 --> 00:33:29.034
<i>The repulsor signature
is significantly higher.</i>

00:33:40.114 --> 00:33:41.794
Good to be back.

00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:43.874
Oh, this ain't gonna be good.

00:33:47.354 --> 00:33:49.474
I got something
special for this guy.

00:33:49.554 --> 00:33:51.674
I'm gonna bust his
bunker with the Ex-Wife.

00:33:51.754 --> 00:33:53.194
With the what?

00:34:03.594 --> 00:34:05.234
Hammer tech?

00:34:05.314 --> 00:34:06.314
Yeah.

00:34:07.914 --> 00:34:09.474
I got this.

00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:04.434
Rhodes. I got an idea.

00:35:04.834 --> 00:35:06.194
You want to be a hero?

00:35:06.274 --> 00:35:07.314
What?

00:35:07.634 --> 00:35:10.634
I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.

00:35:10.714 --> 00:35:12.776
- This is your idea?
- Yep.

00:35:13.274 --> 00:35:15.874
- I'm ready. I'm ready!
- Go, go, go!

00:35:19.634 --> 00:35:20.714
Take it!

00:35:49.314 --> 00:35:50.754
You lose.

00:35:58.234 --> 00:35:59.634
All these drones
are rigged to blow.

00:35:59.714 --> 00:36:01.034
We gotta get out of here, man.

00:36:01.554 --> 00:36:02.754
Pepper?

00:36:42.954 --> 00:36:44.714
Oh, my God!
I can't take this anymore.

00:36:44.794 --> 00:36:46.714
- You can't? Look at me!
- I can't take this.

00:36:46.794 --> 00:36:49.034
My body, literally,
cannot handle the stress.

00:36:49.154 --> 00:36:53.634
I never know if you're gonna kill
yourself or wreck the whole company.

00:36:53.714 --> 00:36:55.714
I think I did okay.

00:36:55.914 --> 00:36:57.954
I quit. I'm resigning.

00:36:58.554 --> 00:36:59.954
That's it.

00:37:00.474 --> 00:37:03.114
What did you just say?
You're done?

00:37:04.394 --> 00:37:07.914
That's surprising.
No, it's not surprising. I get it.

00:37:08.314 --> 00:37:09.514
You don't have to
make any excuses.

00:37:09.634 --> 00:37:11.594
I'm... I'm...
I'm not making any excuses.

00:37:11.674 --> 00:37:12.834
You actually were
just making excuses.

00:37:12.914 --> 00:37:14.394
- But you don't have to.
- No, I wasn't making an excuse.

00:37:14.514 --> 00:37:15.834
- I'm actually very justified.
- Listen. Hey, hey.

00:37:15.914 --> 00:37:17.034
You deserve better.

00:37:17.114 --> 00:37:18.234
Well...

00:37:18.314 --> 00:37:20.874
You've taken such
good care of me.

00:37:21.794 --> 00:37:24.234
I've been in a tough spot,
but you got me through it, so...

00:37:24.314 --> 00:37:25.554
Right?

00:37:25.634 --> 00:37:26.834
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:37:27.634 --> 00:37:28.634
Thank you for understanding.

00:37:28.714 --> 00:37:30.594
Yeah, yeah.
 Let's talk clean-up.

00:37:30.674 --> 00:37:31.914
I'll handle the transition.
It'll be smooth.

00:37:31.994 --> 00:37:33.394
Okay. What about the press?

00:37:33.474 --> 00:37:35.274
Because you only had the job for a week.
That's gonna seem...

00:37:35.354 --> 00:37:37.114
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

00:37:37.194 --> 00:37:38.554
I mean, it's like
the Presidency...

00:37:51.674 --> 00:37:52.874
Weird.

00:37:52.954 --> 00:37:53.954
No, it's not weird.

00:37:54.034 --> 00:37:55.234
- It's okay, right?
- Yeah.

00:37:55.314 --> 00:37:56.634
Run that by me again.

00:37:56.714 --> 00:37:58.594
I think it was weird.

00:37:59.034 --> 00:38:01.994
You guys look like two
seals fighting over a grape.

00:38:02.554 --> 00:38:03.874
I had just quit, actually.

00:38:03.954 --> 00:38:04.954
Yeah, so we're not...

00:38:05.034 --> 00:38:07.554
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

00:38:07.634 --> 00:38:08.634
You should get lost.

00:38:08.714 --> 00:38:10.154
I was here first.
Get a roof.

00:38:11.474 --> 00:38:12.474
I thought you were
out of one-liners.

00:38:12.554 --> 00:38:13.994
That's the last one.

00:38:14.114 --> 00:38:15.394
You kicked ass back
there, by the way.

00:38:15.474 --> 00:38:16.754
Thank you. You, too.

00:38:16.834 --> 00:38:19.314
Listen, my car got taken
out in the explosion,

00:38:19.394 --> 00:38:22.594
so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, okay?

00:38:22.674 --> 00:38:24.394
Not okay.
Not okay with that.

00:38:25.034 --> 00:38:26.234
It wasn't a question.

00:38:31.874 --> 00:38:34.034
How are you gonna resign

00:38:34.114 --> 00:38:35.274
if I don't accept?

00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:37.194
Hmm?

00:38:50.516 --> 00:38:51.836
It's gone.

00:40:04.521 --> 00:40:07.361
And then, with a mighty bellow,

00:40:07.561 --> 00:40:11.721
I flew into the giant metal
creature and laid him low!

00:40:11.881 --> 00:40:15.401
Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?

00:40:15.561 --> 00:40:17.321
As a matter of fact,

00:40:17.361 --> 00:40:21.561
falling was a tactic
lulling the Destroyer...

00:40:35.721 --> 00:40:38.561
My Queen, I'm so
sorry for your loss.

00:41:02.338 --> 00:41:04.058
You'll be a wise king.

00:41:08.369 --> 00:41:10.729
There will never be
a wiser king than you.

00:41:12.209 --> 00:41:13.849
Or a better father.

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:27.975
I have much to learn.

00:41:29.959 --> 00:41:31.439
I know that now.

00:41:36.581 --> 00:41:38.581
Someday, perhaps,

00:41:39.689 --> 00:41:41.569
I shall make you proud.

00:41:49.249 --> 00:41:51.409
You've already made me proud.

00:42:05.703 --> 00:42:07.703
So Earth is lost to us.

00:42:08.992 --> 00:42:09.992
No.

00:42:11.289 --> 00:42:13.289
There is always hope.

00:42:17.289 --> 00:42:18.809
Can you see her?

00:42:21.675 --> 00:42:22.995
<i>Yes.</i>

00:42:26.769 --> 00:42:28.649
I have the particle detectors!

00:42:28.769 --> 00:42:30.809
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite codes?

00:42:30.929 --> 00:42:32.969
Yeah. Have you seen my taser?

00:42:33.129 --> 00:42:34.489
<i>How is she?</i>

00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:36.649
In the car. Come on, Jane!

00:42:37.009 --> 00:42:39.129
<i>She searches for you.</i>

00:43:04.758 --> 00:43:07.638
I don't think I want
you looking at that.

00:43:07.838 --> 00:43:10.038
I'm not sure it pertains
to you anymore.

00:43:10.118 --> 00:43:15.318
Now this, on the other hand, is
Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

00:43:16.638 --> 00:43:17.638
Read it.

00:43:17.718 --> 00:43:18.718
Uh...

00:43:19.638 --> 00:43:23.598
"Personality overview.
Mr. Stark displays compulsive behavior."

00:43:23.678 --> 00:43:25.838
In my own defense,
that was last week.

00:43:27.878 --> 00:43:30.718
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies."
I was dying.

00:43:30.838 --> 00:43:33.478
I mean, please.
And aren't we all?

00:43:33.838 --> 00:43:36.678
"Textbook narcissism"?

00:43:38.678 --> 00:43:39.798
Agreed.

00:43:40.838 --> 00:43:42.278
Okay, here it is. Uh...

00:43:42.358 --> 00:43:45.638
"Recruitment assessment for
Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

00:43:45.718 --> 00:43:46.758
I gotta think about it.

00:43:46.838 --> 00:43:48.318
Read on.

00:43:50.878 --> 00:43:52.398
"Tony Stark not...

00:43:52.478 --> 00:43:54.038
"Not recommended"?

00:43:55.198 --> 00:43:56.438
That doesn't make any sense.

00:43:56.518 --> 00:43:59.398
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

00:44:00.078 --> 00:44:01.518
I got a new ticker.

00:44:01.598 --> 00:44:04.598
I'm trying to do
right by Pepper.

00:44:05.198 --> 00:44:08.078
I'm in a stable-ish
relationship.

00:44:08.918 --> 00:44:10.798
Which leads us to
believe at this juncture

00:44:10.878 --> 00:44:14.038
we'd only like to use
you as a consultant.

00:44:21.038 --> 00:44:22.918
You can't afford me.

00:44:25.238 --> 00:44:27.478
Then again, I will waive
my customary retainer

00:44:27.558 --> 00:44:30.398
in exchange for a small favor.

00:44:31.398 --> 00:44:36.278
Rhodey and I are being honored in
Washington and we need a presenter.

00:44:38.118 --> 00:44:39.638
I'll see what I can do.

00:44:41.398 --> 00:44:43.758
It is my honor to be here today

00:44:43.838 --> 00:44:46.158
to present these
distinguished awards

00:44:46.278 --> 00:44:50.318
to Lieutenant Colonel James
Rhodes and Mr. Tony Stark,

00:44:50.398 --> 00:44:53.718
who is, of course,
a national treasure.

00:44:55.878 --> 00:44:57.198
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

00:44:57.278 --> 00:44:59.638
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

00:44:59.958 --> 00:45:00.918
You deserve this.

00:45:01.038 --> 00:45:02.038
Thank you, sir.

00:45:03.638 --> 00:45:05.878
Mr. Stark. Thank you

00:45:05.958 --> 00:45:09.158
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

00:45:09.238 --> 00:45:10.918
You deserve this.

00:45:11.158 --> 00:45:12.238
Ow!

00:45:12.318 --> 00:45:13.838
Oh, sorry.

00:45:14.918 --> 00:45:18.278
Funny how annoying
a little prick can be, isn't it?

00:45:19.798 --> 00:45:21.598
Let's get a photo.

00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:39.191
<i>Curve ball, high and
outside for ball one.</i>

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:43.231
<i>So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.</i>

00:45:44.031 --> 00:45:46.471
<i>And the crowd well knows
that with one swing of his bat,</i>

00:45:46.551 --> 00:45:49.431
<i>this fellow's capable of making
it a brand-new game again.</i>

00:45:50.871 --> 00:45:54.071
<i>Just an absolutely gorgeous
day here at Ebbets Field.</i>

00:45:54.871 --> 00:45:58.071
<i>The Phillies have
managed to tie it up at 4-4.</i>

00:45:58.911 --> 00:46:01.231
<i>But the Dodgers
have three men on.</i>

00:46:05.711 --> 00:46:08.551
<i>Pearson beaned Reiser
in Philadelphia last month.</i>

00:46:08.671 --> 00:46:11.831
<i>Wouldn't the youngster like
a hit here to return the favor?</i>

00:46:12.231 --> 00:46:14.391
<i>Pete leans in. Here's the pitch.</i>

00:46:14.751 --> 00:46:17.831
<i>Swung on. A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.</i>

00:46:19.751 --> 00:46:21.071
<i>Three runs will score.</i>

00:46:21.431 --> 00:46:24.911
<i>Reiser heads to third.
Durocher's going to wave him in.</i>

00:46:25.911 --> 00:46:28.271
<i>Here comes the relay,
but they won't get him.</i>

00:46:29.671 --> 00:46:30.671
Good morning.

00:46:32.671 --> 00:46:34.431
Or should I say afternoon?

00:46:35.511 --> 00:46:36.591
Where am I?

00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:39.391
You're in a recovery
room in New York City.

00:46:41.271 --> 00:46:44.751
<i>- The Dodgers take the lead, - 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers!</i>

00:46:45.111 --> 00:46:46.951
<i>Everyone is on their feet.</i>

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:50.591
<i>What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.</i>

00:46:50.711 --> 00:46:51.951
Where am I really?

00:46:53.271 --> 00:46:55.271
I'm afraid I don't understand.

00:46:56.031 --> 00:46:57.351
The game.

00:46:57.551 --> 00:47:00.471
It's from May 1941.
I know, 'cause I was there.

00:47:04.471 --> 00:47:06.471
Now, I'm going to ask you again.

00:47:06.951 --> 00:47:07.951
Where am I?

00:47:09.311 --> 00:47:10.631
- Captain Rogers...
- Who are you?

00:47:18.271 --> 00:47:19.951
Captain Rogers, wait!

00:47:21.711 --> 00:47:23.471
All agents, code 13!

00:47:23.951 --> 00:47:26.831
<i>I repeat.
All agents, code 13!</i>

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:48.991
At ease, soldier!

00:47:57.511 --> 00:48:00.471
Look, I'm sorry about
that little show back there,

00:48:01.751 --> 00:48:04.751
but we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

00:48:04.951 --> 00:48:06.271
Break what?

00:48:08.671 --> 00:48:10.351
You've been asleep, Cap.

00:48:10.831 --> 00:48:12.871
For almost 70 years.

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:28.711
You gonna be okay?

00:48:29.705 --> 00:48:30.785
Yeah.

00:48:31.129 --> 00:48:32.449
Yeah, I just...

00:48:35.637 --> 00:48:37.247
I had a date.
