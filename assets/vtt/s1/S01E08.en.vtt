00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.617
Are you the guys from Washington?

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.573
You get many other visitors out here?

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:03.179
How long you been on-site?

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:04.683
Since this morning.

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.630
A Russian oil team called
it in about 18 hours ago.

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:10.109
How come nobody spotted it before?

00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:12.038
It's really not that surprising.

00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:14.481
This landscape's changing all the time.

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:16.301
You got any idea
what this thing is exactly?

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:18.453
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:19.708
I don't think so.

00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:22.290
You know, we don't have
the equipment for a job like this.

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:24.969
How long before
we can start craning it out?

00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:27.113
I don't think you quite understand.

00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:30.293
You guys are going to need
one hell of a crane.

00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:18.403
<i>Base, we're in.</i>

00:02:24.326 --> 00:02:25.717
<i>What is this?</i>

00:02:40.943 --> 00:02:42.369
<i>Careful.</i>

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:04.474
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

00:03:07.582 --> 00:03:08.757
<i>What is it?</i>

00:03:09.037 --> 00:03:10.556
<i>My God.</i>

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.407
<i>Base, get me a line to the Colonel.</i>

00:03:13.842 --> 00:03:15.192
<i>It's 3:00 a.m., sir.</i>

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:17.533
<i>I don't care what time it is.</i>

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:20.033
<i>This one's waited long enough.</i>

00:03:58.593 --> 00:04:01.421
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.

00:04:03.182 --> 00:04:04.780
Now you like the bird.

00:04:04.863 --> 00:04:05.897
Is that right?

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.033
Is that your bird?

00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:08.677
I'm confused.

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:10.452
You said it wasn't…

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:12.733
but now it looks like you're best of pals.

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:14.478
You love that bird, don't you?

00:04:14.974 --> 00:04:16.782
You know what? Take the bird.

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:19.685
Hey!

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.476
Take his pillows, too.

00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:24.710
Both of them.

00:04:25.568 --> 00:04:27.226
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

00:04:31.668 --> 00:04:33.063
I took your stuff.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.066
How does that make you feel?

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.821
Do you feel bad?

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.340
Good.

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:40.336
Because that's how I feel!

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:43.800
We had a contract.

00:04:44.263 --> 00:04:46.233
I saved your life…

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:49.172
and you give me suits.

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.209
That was our deal.

00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:53.426
And you did not deliver.

00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:58.673
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:04.069
Something really, really great
fell into my lap.

00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:06.186
And if it hadn't…

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:08.153
I'd be at your mercy tonight.

00:05:08.444 --> 00:05:10.586
Now I have a piece of Stark tech…

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.459
that I pimped out myself.

00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:14.212
And now your overpriced paperweights…

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:17.180
are gonna look like a backdrop
to my demonstration.

00:05:17.464 --> 00:05:19.484
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

00:05:19.567 --> 00:05:21.623
You talk too much.

00:05:21.927 --> 00:05:23.378
I don't know if you noticed…

00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:26.248
but I don't speak Russian!

00:05:29.601 --> 00:05:31.163
I'm gonna leave now.

00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:33.106
I'm gonna go to the Expo.

00:05:33.382 --> 00:05:34.888
Maybe I'll even get laid.

00:05:35.398 --> 00:05:37.317
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.260
They are not to be trifled with.

00:05:40.294 --> 00:05:42.217
When I get back,
we're gonna renegotiate…

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.232
the terms of our agreement.

00:05:45.205 --> 00:05:47.632
And you're gonna make good
on our arrangement…

00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:48.730
because if you don't…

00:05:48.813 --> 00:05:51.373
you're gonna be exactly what you were
when I found you…

00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:52.904
a dead man.

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:54.563
You got that?

00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:57.756
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:09.283
Dummy, you, can we
clean up this mess?

00:06:09.377 --> 00:06:10.534
You're killing me.
You know I don't...

00:06:10.617 --> 00:06:13.061
<i>Incoming call with
a blocked number, sir.</i>

00:06:13.144 --> 00:06:14.849
My phone privilege is reinstated.

00:06:15.177 --> 00:06:16.198
Lovely.

00:06:16.282 --> 00:06:18.228
Coulson.
How's the Land of Enchantment?

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:21.034
<i>Hey Tony, how you doing?</i>

00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:23.399
<i>I double cycle.</i>

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:24.714
You what?

00:06:25.323 --> 00:06:28.001
You told me double
cycle's more power.

00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:29.453
Good advice.

00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:31.204
You sound pretty sprightly
for a dead guy.

00:06:31.287 --> 00:06:32.563
<i>You, too.</i>

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:36.710
Trace him.
Sir.

00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:37.515
<i>Now…</i>

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:40.547
the true history of Stark
name will be written.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.633
Jarvis, where is he?

00:06:41.716 --> 00:06:43.834
<i>Accessing the Oracle grid.</i>

00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:45.834
<i>Eastern Seaboard.</i>

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:50.169
What your father did
to my family over 40 years…

00:06:50.974 --> 00:06:53.727
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.633
Sounds good.
Let's get together and hash it out.

00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:57.235
<i>Tri-State area.</i>

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.592
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

00:06:59.675 --> 00:07:01.505
I hope you're ready.

00:07:04.487 --> 00:07:06.296
<i>Call trace incomplete.</i>

00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:19.819
<i>- Sir...</i>
- You want to run some tests, run them.

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:22.896
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:25.487
<i>- We are unclear as to the effects--</i>
- I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:31.075
That tastes like coconut.

00:07:31.675 --> 00:07:32.826
And metal.

00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:35.842
Oh, wow, yeah!

00:07:44.843 --> 00:07:46.928
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.

00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:55.964
Heimdall?

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:05.667
Welcome to Asgard.

00:08:22.347 --> 00:08:23.764
He doesn't answer.

00:08:24.474 --> 00:08:26.017
Then we are stranded.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.472
Heimdall!

00:08:27.555 --> 00:08:29.621
If you can hear me, we need you now!

00:08:30.438 --> 00:08:32.767
Heimdall! We need you now!

00:08:39.183 --> 00:08:40.532
Heimdall!

00:08:54.963 --> 00:08:57.994
I must go back to Asgard,
but I give you my word…

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.658
I will return for you.

00:09:09.227 --> 00:09:10.502
Deal?

00:09:23.992 --> 00:09:25.287
Deal.

00:09:41.718 --> 00:09:43.521
Get him to the healing room!

00:09:45.263 --> 00:09:46.994
Leave my brother to me.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.146
I'll keep the car down here, alright?

00:09:58.229 --> 00:09:59.522
Thank you, Happy.

00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:04.701
Justin Hammer. His presentation
will begin shortly in the main pavilion.

00:10:22.837 --> 00:10:24.098
Yeah.

00:10:25.256 --> 00:10:26.879
That's what I'm talking about.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.332
Thanks for coming.

00:10:29.177 --> 00:10:32.452
Ladies and gentlemen,
for far too long this country…

00:10:32.553 --> 00:10:35.850
has had to place its brave
men and women in harm's way…

00:10:35.933 --> 00:10:37.560
but then the Iron Man arrived…

00:10:37.643 --> 00:10:41.164
and we thought the days
of losing lives were behind us.

00:10:42.148 --> 00:10:44.901
Sadly, that technology
was kept out of reach.

00:10:44.984 --> 00:10:47.320
That's not fair. That's not right.

00:10:47.403 --> 00:10:48.628
And it's just too bad.

00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:49.656
Oh, Lord.

00:10:49.739 --> 00:10:51.825
Regardless, it was
an impressive innovation…

00:10:51.908 --> 00:10:54.739
one that grabbed headlines
the world over.

00:10:55.203 --> 00:10:56.734
Well today my friends…

00:10:56.913 --> 00:11:00.100
the press is faced
with quite a different problem.

00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:03.676
They are about to run out of ink.

00:11:08.925 --> 00:11:10.516
Get that out of here.

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.388
Ladies and gentlemen…

00:11:14.764 --> 00:11:17.042
today I present to you…

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.408
the new face…

00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:20.930
of the United States military.

00:11:21.752 --> 00:11:23.344
The Hammer drone.

00:11:25.816 --> 00:11:27.189
Army!

00:11:40.373 --> 00:11:41.840
Navy!

00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:53.518
Air Force!

00:12:01.102 --> 00:12:02.694
Marines!

00:12:14.165 --> 00:12:16.937
Yeah! Yeah!

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.399
That's a hell of a lot better than
some cheerleaders, let me tell you.

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:27.421
But as revolutionary
as this technology is…

00:12:27.504 --> 00:12:31.516
there will always be a need for man
to be present in the theatre of war.

00:12:31.882 --> 00:12:34.845
Ladies and gentlemen,
today I am proud to present to you…

00:12:34.928 --> 00:12:36.763
the very first prototype in…

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:40.141
the Variable Threat Response
Battle Suit…

00:12:40.224 --> 00:12:44.148
and its pilot, Air Force
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.

00:12:45.604 --> 00:12:46.604
What?

00:13:07.596 --> 00:13:09.397
For America and its allies…

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.344
Hammer Industries is reporting for…

00:13:28.064 --> 00:13:29.383
We got trouble.

00:13:29.815 --> 00:13:31.443
Tony, there are civilians present.

00:13:31.526 --> 00:13:34.123
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

00:13:34.226 --> 00:13:35.613
Give them a wave.

00:13:35.696 --> 00:13:37.794
Hey, alright. Yeah.

00:13:37.877 --> 00:13:39.993
All these people are in danger.
We got to get them out of here.

00:13:40.076 --> 00:13:42.078
You got to trust me
for the next five minutes.

00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:44.260
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed
around your house, remember?

00:13:44.343 --> 00:13:46.047
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.

00:13:46.457 --> 00:13:47.853
Vanko's alive?

00:13:50.544 --> 00:13:51.667
Where is he?

00:13:52.171 --> 00:13:52.936
What?

00:13:53.019 --> 00:13:54.305
Where's Vanko?

00:13:54.632 --> 00:13:55.327
Who?

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.396
Tell me.

00:13:56.479 --> 00:13:58.585
What are you doing here, man?

00:14:04.565 --> 00:14:05.630
Is that you?

00:14:05.713 --> 00:14:07.703
<i>No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.</i>

00:14:08.187 --> 00:14:11.024
<i>I can't move. I'm locked up.
I'm locked up!</i>

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:14.130
Get out of here. Go! This whole
system's been compromised.

00:14:14.975 --> 00:14:16.565
Let's take it outside.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.800
No. No!

00:14:40.469 --> 00:14:42.210
Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.

00:14:42.293 --> 00:14:43.539
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:14:45.516 --> 00:14:48.381
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

00:14:48.464 --> 00:14:50.317
On what?
On you.

00:14:55.192 --> 00:14:56.898
Tony, on your six!

00:15:14.378 --> 00:15:15.479
What's going on? What's happening?

00:15:15.562 --> 00:15:16.632
The software's been overridden.

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:18.123
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

00:15:18.206 --> 00:15:19.467
What does that mean?
I think he slaved the drones.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.492
That's impossible.

00:15:20.575 --> 00:15:22.454
- Call the guards.
- All the phones are down, sir.

00:15:22.537 --> 00:15:24.506
Well, then call their… Call their cells.

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:26.163
Their cell phones
are not working, either, sir.

00:15:26.246 --> 00:15:27.505
He's locked us out of the mainframe.

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:28.810
Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

00:15:28.893 --> 00:15:30.396
Please, please, go away. Go away.

00:15:30.479 --> 00:15:31.958
- I've got this handled.
- Have you now?

00:15:32.041 --> 00:15:32.902
Yes, I do.

00:15:32.985 --> 00:15:35.504
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up,
this wouldn't be happening.

00:15:35.587 --> 00:15:38.221
So please, now go away. Thank you.

00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:40.541
Listen, we got to get
these bitches out of here.

00:15:41.038 --> 00:15:42.038
What?

00:15:42.573 --> 00:15:43.908
You tell me who's behind this.

00:15:43.991 --> 00:15:45.415
Who's behind this?

00:15:45.923 --> 00:15:47.254
Ivan. Iv…

00:15:47.337 --> 00:15:48.830
Ivan Vanko.

00:15:48.913 --> 00:15:49.797
Where is he?

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.893
He's at my facility.

00:15:54.877 --> 00:15:56.422
- I need NYPD, please.
- No, no, no, no!

00:15:56.505 --> 00:15:57.752
- Command Central.
- No, no, honey.

00:15:57.835 --> 00:15:59.582
- Don't call the authorities.
- Ok. Right away. Right away.

00:15:59.665 --> 00:16:02.167
Step aside. Step aside.

00:16:02.791 --> 00:16:04.758
Tell me everything you know. Go.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.897
It's said…

00:16:31.205 --> 00:16:36.181
you can still hear and see
what transpires around you.

00:16:37.211 --> 00:16:39.440
I hope it's true…

00:16:41.215 --> 00:16:43.382
so that you may know…

00:16:44.385 --> 00:16:46.433
your death came…

00:16:46.729 --> 00:16:48.683
at the hand…

00:16:49.346 --> 00:16:50.989
of Laufey.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.499
And your death came
by the son of Odin.

00:17:08.075 --> 00:17:09.452
Loki!

00:17:09.535 --> 00:17:11.015
You saved him!

00:17:15.499 --> 00:17:17.377
I swear to you, Mother…

00:17:17.822 --> 00:17:20.591
that they will pay for what
they've done today.

00:17:20.713 --> 00:17:21.830
Loki.

00:17:22.419 --> 00:17:23.437
Thor!

00:17:24.482 --> 00:17:26.521
I knew you'd return to us.

00:17:32.099 --> 00:17:33.685
Why don't you tell her…

00:17:33.768 --> 00:17:37.272
how you sent the Destroyer
to kill our friends, to kill me?

00:17:37.355 --> 00:17:38.356
What?

00:17:38.439 --> 00:17:41.162
Why, it must have been enforcing
Father's last command.

00:17:41.324 --> 00:17:44.246
You're a talented liar, Brother.
Always have been.

00:17:44.523 --> 00:17:46.030
It's good to have you back.

00:17:46.113 --> 00:17:47.520
Now if you'll excuse me…

00:17:47.603 --> 00:17:49.613
I have to destroy Jotunheim.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.186
How are we doing, Jarvis?
<i>Remote reboot unsuccessful.</i>

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.935
Go. This way.

00:18:27.699 --> 00:18:29.589
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?

00:18:29.672 --> 00:18:31.870
Get in the car.
Take me to Hammer Industries.

00:18:31.953 --> 00:18:34.326
- I'm not taking you anywhere.
- Fine. You want me to drive?

00:18:34.409 --> 00:18:36.732
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

00:19:35.433 --> 00:19:36.664
Nice work, kid.

00:19:38.895 --> 00:19:42.314
- You got multiples coming in on you.
- Let's get this away from the Expo.

00:19:47.612 --> 00:19:49.827
When we arrive,
I need you to watch the perimeter.

00:19:50.115 --> 00:19:52.584
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:57.869
Watch the road.
I got it. I got it.

00:20:29.112 --> 00:20:30.197
Listen, listen.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.421
A pack just peeled off.
They're headed back to the Expo.

00:20:32.504 --> 00:20:33.504
Got it.

00:20:37.495 --> 00:20:38.955
I'm closing on you.

00:20:39.038 --> 00:20:41.549
Ordinance coming in hot, Tony.
Watch it.

00:20:57.307 --> 00:20:58.334
Stay in the car.

00:20:58.417 --> 00:20:59.976
I'm not staying in the car.

00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:01.665
I said, stay in the car.

00:21:01.748 --> 00:21:03.119
What are you wearing?

00:21:05.064 --> 00:21:07.065
Look, I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

00:21:07.484 --> 00:21:08.985
You want to help?
Keep the car running.

00:21:09.068 --> 00:21:10.068
Ok.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.801
Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.

00:21:16.422 --> 00:21:17.930
Hold on. Hey!

00:22:02.747 --> 00:22:05.651
Each set of drones is communicating
in its own unique language.

00:22:05.734 --> 00:22:07.291
Well, choose one and focus on that.

00:22:07.374 --> 00:22:09.675
Have you tried Russian?
Why don't you try Russian?

00:22:13.258 --> 00:22:15.635
<i>Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.</i>

00:22:15.718 --> 00:22:17.341
<i>We got it. We're on our way.</i>

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.593
I got him!

00:23:38.544 --> 00:23:40.175
You can't stop it.

00:23:40.258 --> 00:23:43.715
The Bifrost will build until
it rips Jotunheim apart.

00:24:05.154 --> 00:24:06.626
Jane?

00:24:08.282 --> 00:24:09.951
Why have you done this?

00:24:10.034 --> 00:24:13.595
To prove to Father
that I am the worthy son.

00:24:13.871 --> 00:24:16.708
When he wakes,
I will have saved his life.

00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:19.502
I will have destroyed that
race of monsters.

00:24:19.585 --> 00:24:22.129
And I will be true heir to the throne!

00:24:22.212 --> 00:24:24.166
You can't kill an entire race!

00:24:24.249 --> 00:24:25.606
Why not?

00:24:28.673 --> 00:24:32.063
And what is this newfound love
for the Frost Giants?

00:24:32.708 --> 00:24:33.760
You…

00:24:33.873 --> 00:24:35.977
could have killed them
all with your bare hands.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.454
- I've changed.
- So have I.

00:24:39.897 --> 00:24:41.399
Now fight me.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.577
I never wanted the throne!

00:24:47.712 --> 00:24:49.968
I only ever wanted to be your equal.

00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:52.164
I will not fight you, Brother!

00:24:52.247 --> 00:24:53.969
I'm not your brother.

00:24:54.495 --> 00:24:55.890
I never was.

00:24:55.973 --> 00:24:57.853
Loki, this is madness.

00:24:57.957 --> 00:24:59.489
Is it madness?

00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:01.789
Is it?

00:25:03.191 --> 00:25:04.342
Is it?

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.135
Come on. What happened to you
on Earth that turned you so soft?

00:25:10.136 --> 00:25:12.049
Don't tell me it was that woman.

00:25:14.849 --> 00:25:16.011
It was!

00:25:16.346 --> 00:25:18.726
Well, maybe,
when we're finished here…

00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:20.756
I'll pay her a visit myself!

00:26:02.605 --> 00:26:03.680
Thor!

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.968
Brother, please.

00:26:24.293 --> 00:26:25.655
Enough!

00:27:09.255 --> 00:27:10.727
Look at you…

00:27:13.092 --> 00:27:14.620
the Mighty Thor…

00:27:17.513 --> 00:27:19.776
with all your strength…

00:27:20.349 --> 00:27:22.979
and what good does it do you now?

00:27:24.401 --> 00:27:26.046
Do you hear me, Brother?

00:27:26.129 --> 00:27:28.164
There's nothing you can do!

00:27:46.125 --> 00:27:47.722
What are you doing?

00:27:49.128 --> 00:27:52.583
If you destroy the bridge,
you'll never see her again!

00:28:02.141 --> 00:28:03.717
Forgive me, Jane.

00:28:15.075 --> 00:28:16.215
Rhodey, you still locked on?

00:28:16.298 --> 00:28:17.119
Yeah.

00:28:17.202 --> 00:28:20.818
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs.
We're about to get wet on this ride.

00:28:22.874 --> 00:28:24.300
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:28:43.484 --> 00:28:44.644
He's gone.

00:28:49.067 --> 00:28:51.410
I'm sorry, buddy.
Had to thin out the herd.

00:28:51.848 --> 00:28:53.145
What's your 20?

00:29:05.375 --> 00:29:06.240
What are you doing?

00:29:06.323 --> 00:29:08.380
I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

00:29:14.593 --> 00:29:15.934
Tony!

00:29:32.065 --> 00:29:33.777
Reboot complete.

00:29:34.488 --> 00:29:36.240
You got your best friend back.

00:29:36.323 --> 00:29:37.989
<i>Thank you very much,
Agent Romanoff.</i>

00:29:38.072 --> 00:29:39.702
Well done with the new chest piece.

00:29:39.785 --> 00:29:43.455
I am reading significantly higher output
and your vitals all look promising.

00:29:43.538 --> 00:29:46.292
<i>Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying.
Thank you.</i>

00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:48.464
<i>What do you mean you're not dying?
Did you just say you're dying?</i>

00:29:48.547 --> 00:29:50.296
<i>Is that you? No, I'm not.</i>

00:29:50.379 --> 00:29:51.922
<i>Not any more.
What's going on?</i>

00:29:52.005 --> 00:29:53.675
<i>I was going to tell you.
I didn't want to alarm you.</i>

00:29:53.758 --> 00:29:55.449
<i>You were gonna tell me?
You really were dying?</i>

00:29:55.532 --> 00:29:57.194
<i>- You didn't let me.
- Why didn't you tell me that?</i>

00:29:57.277 --> 00:29:59.921
<i>I was gonna make you an omelette
and tell you.</i>

00:30:00.004 --> 00:30:03.058
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

00:30:03.141 --> 00:30:04.649
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

00:30:04.732 --> 00:30:06.645
<i>- Great. Pepper?
- Are you ok now?</i>

00:30:06.728 --> 00:30:07.938
<i>I am fine. Don't be mad.</i>

00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:09.606
<i>- I will formally apologise…
- I am mad!</i>

00:30:09.689 --> 00:30:12.489
<i>…when I'm not fending off
a Hammeroid attack.</i>

00:30:12.734 --> 00:30:14.195
<i>Fine.
We could have been in Venice.</i>

00:30:14.278 --> 00:30:15.619
<i>Oh, please.</i>

00:30:18.212 --> 00:30:19.561
Rhodes?

00:30:20.468 --> 00:30:22.426
Snap out of it, buddy. I need you.

00:30:23.912 --> 00:30:25.800
They're coming.
Come on, let's roll. Get up.

00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:31.549
Oh, man. You can have your suit back.

00:30:35.173 --> 00:30:36.256
You ok?

00:30:36.597 --> 00:30:38.000
Yeah, thanks.

00:30:39.761 --> 00:30:41.205
Tony, look, I'm sorry.

00:30:41.288 --> 00:30:42.181
Ok?
Don't be.

00:30:42.264 --> 00:30:43.474
No. I should have trusted you more.

00:30:43.557 --> 00:30:45.282
I'm the one who put you in this position.
Forget it.

00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:47.462
No. It's your fault.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:49.273
Thank you.
That's all I wanted to hear.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.060
Partner.

00:30:51.189 --> 00:30:52.457
They're coming in hot…

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.833
any second. What's the play?

00:30:55.402 --> 00:30:57.053
Well, we want to take
the high ground, ok?

00:30:57.136 --> 00:30:58.918
So let's put the biggest gun up on that ridge.

00:30:59.001 --> 00:31:00.188
Got you.

00:31:00.907 --> 00:31:01.992
- Where do you want to be?
- Where are you going?

00:31:02.075 --> 00:31:03.702
- What're you talking about?
- I meant me.

00:31:03.785 --> 00:31:05.705
You have a big gun.
You are not the big gun.

00:31:05.788 --> 00:31:06.756
Tony, don't be jealous.

00:31:06.839 --> 00:31:08.278
No. It's subtle, all the bells and whistles.

00:31:08.361 --> 00:31:10.732
- Yeah, it's called being a badass.
- Fine.

00:31:11.793 --> 00:31:12.793
Alright.

00:31:12.944 --> 00:31:15.172
You go up top. I'll draw them in.

00:31:15.255 --> 00:31:17.214
Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.

00:31:17.297 --> 00:31:18.616
Ok, you got a spot.
Where's mine?

00:31:18.699 --> 00:31:21.399
It's the kill box, Tony. Ok?
This is where you go to die.

00:32:11.214 --> 00:32:12.983
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah, nice.

00:32:20.987 --> 00:32:22.403
Rhodey?

00:32:23.615 --> 00:32:24.659
Get down.

00:32:36.028 --> 00:32:37.714
I think you should lead with that next time.

00:32:37.797 --> 00:32:39.886
Yeah. Sorry, boss. I can only use it once.

00:32:39.969 --> 00:32:41.434
It's a one-off.

00:32:43.635 --> 00:32:45.529
I told you that five minutes ago.

00:32:47.052 --> 00:32:48.626
That's your guy here.

00:32:49.849 --> 00:32:51.831
- Excuse me?
- You're being placed under arrest.

00:32:51.977 --> 00:32:53.628
- Are you kidding me?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

00:32:53.711 --> 00:32:55.235
I'm trying to help here.

00:32:59.234 --> 00:33:00.986
I get it. I see what you're doing.

00:33:01.069 --> 00:33:02.779
You're trying to pin this on me?

00:33:02.862 --> 00:33:04.448
That's good. That's good.

00:33:04.531 --> 00:33:06.096
You're starting to think like a CEO…

00:33:06.179 --> 00:33:07.576
taking out the competition.

00:33:07.659 --> 00:33:08.469
I like that.

00:33:08.552 --> 00:33:09.976
You think you're making a problem for me?

00:33:10.059 --> 00:33:11.298
I'm gonna make a problem for you.

00:33:11.381 --> 00:33:13.784
I'm gonna be seeing you again
real soon.

00:33:18.503 --> 00:33:20.516
When they get here, I think
you should station them at the south…

00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:22.454
east and both west exits.

00:33:22.984 --> 00:33:25.122
We shut down the 7 train
in and out of Willets Point already.

00:33:25.205 --> 00:33:27.971
Well, have city buses there
to ferry people to operating lines.

00:33:28.054 --> 00:33:29.598
Yeah. Are you coming with us?

00:33:29.681 --> 00:33:31.523
No, I'm gonna stay till the park is clear.

00:33:31.606 --> 00:33:32.656
Ok.

00:33:34.823 --> 00:33:37.439
Heads up.
You got one more drone incoming.

00:33:37.522 --> 00:33:39.156
This one looks different.

00:33:39.316 --> 00:33:41.767
<i>The repulsor signature
is significantly higher.</i>

00:33:52.787 --> 00:33:54.453
Good to be back.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.715
This ain't gonna be good.

00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:02.130
I got something special for this guy.

00:34:02.213 --> 00:34:04.259
I'm gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.

00:34:04.342 --> 00:34:05.779
With the what?

00:34:16.269 --> 00:34:17.414
Hammer tech?

00:34:17.904 --> 00:34:19.072
Yeah.

00:34:20.607 --> 00:34:21.925
I got this.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.269
Rhodes. I got an idea.

00:35:17.497 --> 00:35:18.881
You want to be a hero?

00:35:18.964 --> 00:35:19.913
What?

00:35:19.996 --> 00:35:21.988
I could really use a sidekick.

00:35:22.071 --> 00:35:23.295
Put your hand up.

00:35:23.378 --> 00:35:24.667
This is your idea?

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:25.781
Yep.

00:35:25.964 --> 00:35:28.395
I'm ready. I'm ready.
Go, go, go!

00:35:32.345 --> 00:35:33.589
Take it.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.717
You lose.

00:36:10.967 --> 00:36:14.019
All these drones are rigged to blow.
We got to get out of here, man.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.455
Pepper?

00:36:55.637 --> 00:36:57.334
Oh, my God! I can't take this any more.

00:36:57.417 --> 00:36:58.672
You can't?
I can't take this.

00:36:58.755 --> 00:36:59.396
Well, look at me.

00:36:59.479 --> 00:37:01.726
My body literally
cannot handle the stress.

00:37:01.809 --> 00:37:03.139
I never know if you're gonna…

00:37:03.222 --> 00:37:06.031
kill yourself or wreck the whole company.

00:37:06.114 --> 00:37:08.220
I think I did ok.

00:37:08.417 --> 00:37:10.634
I quit. I'm resigning.

00:37:11.236 --> 00:37:12.486
That's it.

00:37:13.196 --> 00:37:14.246
What did you just say?

00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:15.531
You're done?

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:19.211
That's surprising.
No, it's not surprising.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.681
I get it.

00:37:20.995 --> 00:37:22.246
You don't have to make any excuses.

00:37:22.329 --> 00:37:24.291
I'm… I'm… I'm not making any excuses.

00:37:24.374 --> 00:37:25.500
You actually were just making excuses…

00:37:25.583 --> 00:37:27.003
- …but you don't have to.
- No, I wasn't making an excuse.

00:37:27.086 --> 00:37:28.638
- I'm actually very justified.
- Listen. Hey, hey.

00:37:28.721 --> 00:37:30.788
- You deserve better.
- Well…

00:37:30.871 --> 00:37:32.945
You've taken such good care of me.

00:37:34.467 --> 00:37:37.073
I've been in a tough spot,
but you got me through it, so…

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:38.221
Right?

00:37:38.304 --> 00:37:39.681
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:41.196
Thank you for understanding.

00:37:41.279 --> 00:37:43.310
Yeah, yeah. Let's. Let's talk.
Let's talk clean-up.

00:37:43.393 --> 00:37:44.444
I'll handle the transition.

00:37:44.527 --> 00:37:45.981
- It'll be smooth.
- Ok. What about the press?

00:37:46.064 --> 00:37:47.139
Because you only had the job for a week.

00:37:47.222 --> 00:37:47.860
That's gonna seem…

00:37:47.943 --> 00:37:49.716
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

00:37:49.799 --> 00:37:51.499
I mean, it's like the Presidency…

00:38:04.212 --> 00:38:05.399
Weird.

00:38:05.722 --> 00:38:07.241
- No, it's not weird.
- It's ok, right?

00:38:07.324 --> 00:38:09.249
- Yeah.
- Run that by me again.

00:38:09.419 --> 00:38:11.012
I think it was weird.

00:38:11.713 --> 00:38:12.633
You guys look like…

00:38:12.716 --> 00:38:14.744
two seals fighting over a grape.

00:38:15.216 --> 00:38:17.595
- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not…

00:38:17.678 --> 00:38:20.263
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

00:38:20.346 --> 00:38:23.234
- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.

00:38:24.183 --> 00:38:26.352
- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.

00:38:26.811 --> 00:38:28.139
You kicked ass back there, by the way.

00:38:28.222 --> 00:38:29.439
Thank you. You, too.

00:38:29.522 --> 00:38:31.947
Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion…

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:35.055
so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, ok?

00:38:35.361 --> 00:38:37.412
Not ok. Not ok with that.

00:38:37.697 --> 00:38:39.117
It wasn't a question.

00:38:44.537 --> 00:38:45.804
How are you gonna resign…

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:47.997
if I don't accept?

00:39:19.755 --> 00:39:21.385
I could have done it, Father!

00:39:22.703 --> 00:39:24.486
I could have done it!

00:39:25.158 --> 00:39:26.425
For you!

00:39:27.194 --> 00:39:28.577
For all of us!

00:39:30.669 --> 00:39:31.983
No, Loki.

00:39:40.763 --> 00:39:42.064
Loki, no.

00:39:43.015 --> 00:39:45.038
No!

00:39:49.438 --> 00:39:50.718
No.

00:40:06.956 --> 00:40:08.177
It's gone.

00:41:20.821 --> 00:41:23.825
<i>And then, with a mighty bellow…</i>

00:41:23.908 --> 00:41:28.079
<i>I flew into the giant metal creature
and laid him low!</i>

00:41:28.162 --> 00:41:31.749
<i>Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?</i>

00:41:31.832 --> 00:41:33.374
<i>As a matter of fact…</i>

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:37.740
<i>falling was a tactic
of lulling the Destroyer...</i>

00:41:52.019 --> 00:41:54.792
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

00:42:00.694 --> 00:42:02.006
How is he?

00:42:04.365 --> 00:42:06.368
He mourns for his brother.

00:42:07.794 --> 00:42:08.803
And...

00:42:10.218 --> 00:42:11.455
He misses her.

00:42:12.623 --> 00:42:14.062
The mortal.

00:42:30.516 --> 00:42:32.183
You'll be a wise king.

00:42:36.564 --> 00:42:38.966
There will never be
a wiser king than you.

00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:41.953
Or a better father.

00:42:53.105 --> 00:42:54.618
I have…

00:42:54.835 --> 00:42:56.567
much to learn.

00:42:58.127 --> 00:42:59.772
I know that now.

00:43:04.798 --> 00:43:06.465
Someday, perhaps…

00:43:07.886 --> 00:43:09.864
I shall make you proud.

00:43:17.438 --> 00:43:19.230
You've already made me proud.

00:43:34.117 --> 00:43:35.960
So Earth is lost to us.

00:43:37.377 --> 00:43:38.380
No.

00:43:39.543 --> 00:43:41.177
There is always hope.

00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:46.966
Can you see her?

00:43:49.977 --> 00:43:51.024
Yes.

00:43:54.928 --> 00:43:56.894
I have the particle detectors!

00:43:56.977 --> 00:43:59.000
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite codes?

00:43:59.083 --> 00:44:01.232
Yeah. Have you seen my taser?

00:44:01.315 --> 00:44:02.631
How is she?

00:44:02.714 --> 00:44:03.734
In the car.

00:44:03.817 --> 00:44:05.152
Come on, Jane!

00:44:05.235 --> 00:44:07.320
She searches for you.

00:44:29.297 --> 00:44:31.289
I don't think I want you looking at that.

00:44:32.243 --> 00:44:34.624
I'm not sure it pertains to you any more.

00:44:34.707 --> 00:44:36.561
Now this, on the other hand…

00:44:36.896 --> 00:44:40.262
is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

00:44:41.213 --> 00:44:42.400
Read it.

00:44:44.216 --> 00:44:47.786
Personality overview. Mr Stark displays
compulsive behaviour.

00:44:48.209 --> 00:44:50.409
In my own defence, that was last week.

00:44:52.516 --> 00:44:55.308
Prone to self-destructive tendencies.
I was dying.

00:44:55.391 --> 00:44:57.946
I mean, please. And aren't we all?

00:44:58.439 --> 00:45:01.159
Textbook narcissism?

00:45:03.318 --> 00:45:04.608
Agreed.

00:45:05.487 --> 00:45:06.677
Ok, here it is.

00:45:06.947 --> 00:45:09.006
Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative.

00:45:09.089 --> 00:45:10.221
Iron Man? Yes.

00:45:10.304 --> 00:45:12.329
I got to think about it.
Read on.

00:45:15.338 --> 00:45:16.802
Tony Stark not…

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.822
Not recommended?

00:45:19.835 --> 00:45:21.045
That doesn't make any sense.

00:45:21.128 --> 00:45:24.347
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

00:45:24.715 --> 00:45:26.133
I got a new ticker.

00:45:26.216 --> 00:45:29.689
I'm trying to do right by Pepper.

00:45:29.803 --> 00:45:33.022
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

00:45:33.557 --> 00:45:35.434
Which leads us to believe at this juncture…

00:45:35.517 --> 00:45:38.479
we'd only like to use you as a consultant.

00:45:45.611 --> 00:45:47.094
You can't afford me.

00:45:49.823 --> 00:45:53.713
Then again, I will waive my
customary retainer in exchange for…

00:45:54.161 --> 00:45:55.500
a small favour.

00:45:55.996 --> 00:45:59.557
Rhodey and I are being
honoured in Washington and…

00:45:59.938 --> 00:46:01.374
we need a presenter.

00:46:02.753 --> 00:46:04.169
I'll see what I can do.

00:46:05.964 --> 00:46:08.306
It is my honour to be here today…

00:46:08.389 --> 00:46:10.722
to present these distinguished awards…

00:46:10.805 --> 00:46:14.706
to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
and Mr Tony Stark…

00:46:14.973 --> 00:46:18.424
who is, of course,
a national treasure.

00:46:20.479 --> 00:46:21.569
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel…

00:46:21.652 --> 00:46:24.328
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

00:46:24.566 --> 00:46:26.538
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

00:46:28.278 --> 00:46:29.572
Mr Stark.

00:46:29.655 --> 00:46:33.743
Thank you for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

00:46:33.826 --> 00:46:35.510
You deserve this.

00:46:36.954 --> 00:46:38.578
Oh, sorry.

00:46:39.545 --> 00:46:43.264
Funny how annoying
a little prick can be, isn't it?

00:46:44.292 --> 00:46:46.055
Let's get a photo.

00:47:06.255 --> 00:47:09.691
<i>Curve ball,
high and outside for ball one.</i>

00:47:09.842 --> 00:47:12.838
<i>So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.</i>

00:47:13.446 --> 00:47:16.041
<i>And the crowd well knows that
with one swing of his bat…</i>

00:47:16.124 --> 00:47:19.123
<i>this fellow's capable of making it
a brand-new game again.</i>

00:47:20.455 --> 00:47:23.573
<i>Just an absolutely gorgeous day
here at Ebbets Field.</i>

00:47:24.625 --> 00:47:27.403
<i>The Phillies have managed
to tie it up at 4-4.</i>

00:47:28.448 --> 00:47:30.646
<i>But the Dodgers have three men on.</i>

00:47:35.504 --> 00:47:38.112
<i>Pearson beaned Reiser
in Philadelphia last month.</i>

00:47:38.195 --> 00:47:40.873
<i>Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here
to return the favor?</i>

00:47:41.872 --> 00:47:42.945
<i>Pete leans in.</i>

00:47:43.028 --> 00:47:44.121
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

00:47:44.204 --> 00:47:45.062
<i>Swung on.</i>

00:47:45.145 --> 00:47:47.748
<i>A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.</i>

00:47:49.115 --> 00:47:50.712
<i>Three runs will score.</i>

00:47:50.915 --> 00:47:52.484
<i>Reiser heads to third.</i>

00:47:52.732 --> 00:47:54.648
<i>Durocher's going to wave him in.</i>

00:47:55.288 --> 00:47:57.886
<i>Here comes the relay,
but they won't get him.</i>

00:47:59.378 --> 00:48:00.581
Good morning.

00:48:02.146 --> 00:48:04.141
Or should I say afternoon?

00:48:05.091 --> 00:48:06.415
Where am I?

00:48:07.114 --> 00:48:09.263
You're in a recovery room
in New York City.

00:48:10.636 --> 00:48:14.394
<i>The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers.</i>

00:48:14.637 --> 00:48:16.734
<i>Everyone is on their feet.</i>

00:48:16.992 --> 00:48:20.353
<i>What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.</i>

00:48:20.436 --> 00:48:21.876
Where am I really?

00:48:22.994 --> 00:48:24.774
I am afraid I don't understand.

00:48:25.566 --> 00:48:26.739
The game.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.106
It's from May 1941.
I know, because I was there.

00:48:33.826 --> 00:48:36.094
Now, I am going to ask you again.

00:48:36.828 --> 00:48:38.095
Where am I?

00:48:38.698 --> 00:48:40.651
Captain Rogers.
Who are you?

00:48:47.718 --> 00:48:49.523
Captain Rogers, wait.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:53.245
All agents, code 13.

00:48:53.694 --> 00:48:56.445
<i>I repeat.
All agents, code 13.</i>

00:49:16.802 --> 00:49:18.626
At ease, soldier.

00:49:27.142 --> 00:49:30.189
Look, I am sorry about that
little show back there but…

00:49:31.406 --> 00:49:34.163
we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

00:49:34.539 --> 00:49:35.808
Break what?

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.824
You have been asleep, Cap.

00:49:40.504 --> 00:49:42.372
For almost 70 years.

00:49:56.983 --> 00:49:58.477
You going to be ok?

00:49:59.232 --> 00:50:00.389
Yeah.

00:50:00.704 --> 00:50:02.021
Yeah, I just…

00:50:05.317 --> 00:50:06.839
I had a date.
