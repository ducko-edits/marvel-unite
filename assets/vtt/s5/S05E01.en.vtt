00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:19.886
<i>This is the Asgardian</i>

00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:22.498
<i>refugee vessel</i> Statesman.

00:00:23.605 --> 00:00:26.245
<i>Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.</i>

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:27.805
<i>We have very few soldiers here.</i>

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:29.885
<i>This is not a warcraft.</i>

00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:31.965
<i>I repeat, this is
not a warcraft.</i>

00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:48.445
Hear me and rejoice.

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:54.485
You have had the privilege

00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:57.245
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:02.405
You may think this is suffering.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:04.605
No.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:08.005
It is salvation.

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:15.565
Universal scales
tip toward balance

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:17.405
because of your sacrifice.

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.445
Smile.

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:23.805
For even in death,

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:26.325
you have become
Children of Thanos.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:43.805
I know what it's like to lose.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.965
To feel so desperately
that you're right...

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.445
yet to fail, nonetheless.

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.165
It's frightening.

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:05.485
Turns the legs to jelly.

00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:09.725
But I ask you, to what end?

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:13.725
Dread it,
run from it...

00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:17.325
destiny arrives all the same.

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:20.365
And now, it's here.

00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:22.765
Or should I say...

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:25.645
I am.

00:02:31.045 --> 00:02:32.405
You talk too much.

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:35.125
The Tesseract.

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:37.645
Or your brother's head.

00:02:42.325 --> 00:02:44.725
I assume you have a preference.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.245
Oh, I do.

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:50.685
Kill away.

00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:07.085
All right, stop!

00:03:10.645 --> 00:03:12.605
We don't have the Tesseract.

00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:14.565
It was destroyed on Asgard.

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:28.245
You really are
the worst brother.

00:03:33.325 --> 00:03:35.205
I assure you, brother...

00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:37.405
the sun will shine on us again.

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:42.285
Your optimism is
misplaced, Asgardian.

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:46.405
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

00:03:46.765 --> 00:03:47.765
And for another...

00:03:50.245 --> 00:03:51.445
we have a Hulk.

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:05.485
Let him have his fun.

00:04:57.805 --> 00:04:59.245
Allfathers...

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:04.405
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

00:05:05.245 --> 00:05:06.325
time.

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:22.605
That was a mistake.

00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:30.165
No!

00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:41.925
You're going to die for that.

00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:46.285
Shh.

00:05:53.205 --> 00:05:54.925
My humble personage...

00:05:56.365 --> 00:05:58.645
bows before your grandeur.

00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:05.165
No other being has
ever had the might...

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.245
nay, the nobility...

00:06:07.645 --> 00:06:12.325
to wield not one, but
two Infinity Stones.

00:06:15.805 --> 00:06:20.205
The universe lies
within your grasp.

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:02.205
There are two more
stones on Earth.

00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:07.165
Find them, my children, and
bring them to me on Titan.

00:07:07.485 --> 00:07:08.885
Father, we will not fail you.

00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:10.565
If I might interject.

00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:15.005
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

00:07:15.925 --> 00:07:18.605
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.

00:07:18.725 --> 00:07:20.925
If you consider
failure experience.

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:23.885
I consider experience
experience.

00:07:25.085 --> 00:07:26.565
Almighty Thanos...

00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:31.525
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:36.525
Odinson...

00:07:40.445 --> 00:07:42.365
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...

00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:44.885
god of mischief...

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:47.245
do hereby pledge to you...

00:07:48.685 --> 00:07:52.565
my undying fidelity.

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:04.605
Undying?

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:11.045
You should choose
your words more carefully.

00:08:32.605 --> 00:08:33.605
You...

00:08:34.725 --> 00:08:36.325
will never be...

00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:40.165
a god.

00:08:50.445 --> 00:08:51.445
No!

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.925
No resurrections this time.

00:09:32.525 --> 00:09:34.685
No. Loki.

00:10:13.485 --> 00:10:16.405
<i>Seriously, you don't
have any money?</i>

00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:19.645
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

00:10:19.805 --> 00:10:21.085
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:23.125
Maybe they'll make you a
metaphysical ham on rye.

00:10:23.285 --> 00:10:25.125
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.

00:10:25.285 --> 00:10:26.285
Dollars?

00:10:26.445 --> 00:10:27.805
- Rupees.
- Which is?

00:10:28.365 --> 00:10:29.805
Uh, buck and a half.

00:10:29.965 --> 00:10:31.165
What do you want?

00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:33.965
I wouldn't say
no to a tuna melt.

00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:48.405
Thanos is coming.

00:10:48.925 --> 00:10:50.205
He's coming.

00:10:54.365 --> 00:10:55.645
Who?

00:12:23.395 --> 00:12:26.395
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?

00:12:28.755 --> 00:12:31.235
Hello?
Do you copy?

00:13:00.755 --> 00:13:02.595
Hi. I'm Vers.
Kree Starforce.

00:13:02.755 --> 00:13:03.955
Is this C-53?

00:13:06.515 --> 00:13:09.075
Do you understand me?
Is my universal translator working?

00:13:09.235 --> 00:13:11.235
Yeah. I understand you.

00:13:11.555 --> 00:13:12.755
Oh, good.

00:13:12.915 --> 00:13:14.715
Are you in charge of
security for this district?

00:13:16.435 --> 00:13:19.275
Sort of. Uh, the movie
theater has its own guy.

00:13:20.755 --> 00:13:22.635
Where can I find
communications equipment?

00:13:29.755 --> 00:13:30.875
Thank you.

00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:46.179
<i>Vers?</i>

00:13:46.337 --> 00:13:47.393
<i>- Come in! Vers?
- We're sorry.</i>

00:13:47.483 --> 00:13:49.462
<i>A long-distance
company access code</i>

00:13:49.592 --> 00:13:50.592
<i>is required--</i>

00:13:58.157 --> 00:14:01.037
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

00:14:08.157 --> 00:14:09.677
Did you call this in?

00:14:24.642 --> 00:14:25.779
<i>Beacon activated.</i>

00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:30.157
Excuse me, miss.

00:14:30.317 --> 00:14:32.717
You know anything about
a lady blowing a hole...

00:14:32.877 --> 00:14:35.712
through the roof of that
Blockbuster over there?

00:14:35.816 --> 00:14:38.837
Witness says she was
dressed for laser tag.

00:14:40.237 --> 00:14:41.357
Oh.

00:14:41.717 --> 00:14:43.677
Yeah, I think she went that way.

00:14:44.135 --> 00:14:47.215
Uh, I'd like to ask
you some questions.

00:14:47.717 --> 00:14:51.557
Maybe give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

00:14:52.117 --> 00:14:53.717
Could I see some
identification, please?

00:14:54.117 --> 00:14:55.637
Vers. Kree Starforce.

00:14:55.757 --> 00:14:56.797
We don't carry
our identification

00:14:56.877 --> 00:14:57.877
on little cards.

00:14:57.957 --> 00:14:58.957
Vers?

00:14:59.797 --> 00:15:01.597
Starforce?

00:15:02.997 --> 00:15:04.357
How long you plan to be in town?

00:15:04.557 --> 00:15:05.597
Oh, I'll be out of your hair...

00:15:05.757 --> 00:15:06.997
as soon as I track
down the Skrulls

00:15:07.077 --> 00:15:08.797
that are infiltrating
your planet.

00:15:09.837 --> 00:15:10.997
Skrulls?

00:15:11.517 --> 00:15:12.597
Shapeshifters?

00:15:12.757 --> 00:15:15.797
They can transform into
any life-form down to the DNA.

00:15:17.277 --> 00:15:18.877
Oh, boy. You guys don't
have any clue, do you?

00:15:19.397 --> 00:15:21.277
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

00:15:22.277 --> 00:15:27.557
How do we know you're not
one of those shapeshifters?

00:15:27.717 --> 00:15:29.517
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

00:15:29.677 --> 00:15:31.597
You have finally asked
a relevant question.

00:15:31.757 --> 00:15:34.717
No! Congratulations
to you, Starforce lady.

00:15:34.917 --> 00:15:36.997
You're under arrest.

00:15:44.837 --> 00:15:46.037
Rook!

00:15:46.917 --> 00:15:48.157
Rook, let's roll!

00:15:57.877 --> 00:15:58.997
Did you see her weapon?

00:15:59.157 --> 00:16:01.397
I did not.

00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:11.357
Watch it!

00:16:43.957 --> 00:16:46.397
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

00:17:07.437 --> 00:17:10.197
"Trust me, true believer."
"Trust me."

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:17.357
"Trust me, true believer."

00:18:03.517 --> 00:18:04.517
Get off!

00:19:00.237 --> 00:19:01.997
Train's heading for
a tunnel up ahead.

00:19:05.037 --> 00:19:06.997
Let's greet them at the station.

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:20.557
<i>Mr. Fury, this is Agent Coulson.</i>

00:19:21.677 --> 00:19:23.597
Uh, I'm still here
at the Blockbuster.

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:26.917
And, uh, where'd everybody go?

00:19:27.437 --> 00:19:29.437
<i>I finished collecting
evidence...</i>

00:20:57.677 --> 00:20:58.917
We need an ambulance!

00:20:59.117 --> 00:21:00.277
Someone call 911!

00:21:00.437 --> 00:21:01.917
Hey! You all right?

00:21:02.117 --> 00:21:03.917
Oh, my gosh! Is everyone okay?

00:21:04.117 --> 00:21:05.117
Anyone else see that?

00:21:05.277 --> 00:21:08.197
Official S.H.I.E.L.D. activity.
Stay back.

00:21:13.209 --> 00:21:15.169
<i>Okay.
We're in.</i>

00:21:18.329 --> 00:21:20.449
Oh, this place is a maze.

00:21:20.609 --> 00:21:22.489
Where's that map?

00:21:25.529 --> 00:21:27.089
We're definitely close.

00:21:27.249 --> 00:21:29.049
- You ready?
- I'm ready, Daddy.

00:21:29.209 --> 00:21:30.929
Are you sure?
'Cause once we're inside,

00:21:31.009 --> 00:21:33.209
you show any hesitation
or fear, we're done.

00:21:33.369 --> 00:21:35.329
I eat fear for breakfast.

00:21:35.489 --> 00:21:37.969
Wow. That is super cool.

00:21:38.129 --> 00:21:39.209
Come on.

00:21:43.529 --> 00:21:46.649
Look! It's Anton.
He'll show us the way.

00:21:46.809 --> 00:21:48.689
Anton, which way do we go?

00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:53.369
Anton, which way do we go?

00:22:01.329 --> 00:22:02.489
Thanks, Anton!

00:22:04.249 --> 00:22:07.129
Look, the ants have
burrowed into the tech facility.

00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:09.009
Oh no, lasers!

00:22:11.049 --> 00:22:13.169
Oh! I think I got lased!

00:22:15.449 --> 00:22:17.649
The secret vault.

00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:20.609
Tell me you brought
the contact lens.

00:22:20.769 --> 00:22:22.449
Yup.

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:26.489
Perfect!
Right there.

00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:32.849
There! It's the micro-treasure!

00:22:33.009 --> 00:22:34.649
My trophy?

00:22:35.209 --> 00:22:36.329
It looks like treasure.

00:22:36.489 --> 00:22:37.769
Oh, it is to me.

00:22:37.929 --> 00:22:39.329
I want to take it
to show-and-tell.

00:22:39.489 --> 00:22:40.529
Oh, no, you can't do that.

00:22:40.689 --> 00:22:43.809
You can't. It never leaves the house.
It's too important.

00:22:44.009 --> 00:22:46.049
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

00:22:46.209 --> 00:22:47.209
I'm so touched you think

00:22:47.289 --> 00:22:49.129
I'm the world's
greatest grandma.

00:22:49.303 --> 00:22:50.983
It makes me want
to knit you a sweater.

00:22:53.069 --> 00:22:54.433
Oh, no, the fuzz!

00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:55.463
Hey, Scotty...

00:22:55.623 --> 00:22:56.663
I was looking at the schematics

00:22:56.743 --> 00:22:58.183
for the Karapetyan buildings...

00:22:58.343 --> 00:22:59.423
and I think we have

00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:00.783
way too many security
cameras, don't we?

00:23:00.943 --> 00:23:02.183
No, no, not at all.

00:23:02.343 --> 00:23:03.743
I mean, 'cause it's a
lot of security cameras.

00:23:03.943 --> 00:23:05.063
I know what he needs.

00:23:05.143 --> 00:23:06.943
Who's the security
expert in our business?

00:23:07.103 --> 00:23:07.903
You are, but I'm running
the company, right?

00:23:07.983 --> 00:23:08.943
And if we overquote him...

00:23:09.103 --> 00:23:10.103
he's gonna go somewhere else.

00:23:10.183 --> 00:23:10.903
I mean, we gotta land this bird.

00:23:11.063 --> 00:23:12.263
He ain't goin' anywhere.

00:23:12.343 --> 00:23:13.503
And the expression
is "land this fish."

00:23:13.703 --> 00:23:15.103
No, it's "land the bird."

00:23:15.263 --> 00:23:16.343
Just like you land the plane.

00:23:16.423 --> 00:23:17.503
You gotta land the
plane to be in business.

00:23:17.703 --> 00:23:18.983
I know it's silly to get hung up

00:23:19.063 --> 00:23:20.583
on these kinds
of things, but I do.

00:23:20.743 --> 00:23:21.903
How am I gonna land a fish?

00:23:22.063 --> 00:23:23.943
It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore...

00:23:24.063 --> 00:23:26.303
and it battled a hawk,
who's gonna win?

00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:29.463
You've really turned
me around on this thing.

00:23:29.623 --> 00:23:31.543
It's okay.
We're gonna land Karapetyan.

00:23:31.703 --> 00:23:32.943
Now, if you just excuse me...

00:23:33.103 --> 00:23:33.703
I'm in the middle of trying to

00:23:33.783 --> 00:23:34.463
steal something
with my daughter.

00:23:34.623 --> 00:23:35.663
I'm gonna go recheck it.

00:23:35.943 --> 00:23:38.383
To the escape ant!

00:23:39.463 --> 00:23:42.303
Let's bounce before
the po-po come back!

00:23:42.463 --> 00:23:45.383
The po-po?
How do you even know that?

00:23:45.543 --> 00:23:47.543
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

00:23:58.663 --> 00:23:59.783
Crash landing!

00:24:00.143 --> 00:24:01.503
Whoo!

00:24:03.783 --> 00:24:05.223
I wish we could shrink for real.

00:24:05.343 --> 00:24:06.903
Oh. That is pretty cool.

00:24:07.503 --> 00:24:08.623
Hey, I'm headed
to the office, Scotty.

00:24:09.263 --> 00:24:10.463
And sorry about freaking
out earlier, you know.

00:24:10.543 --> 00:24:11.703
But I feel like I'm way better.

00:24:11.863 --> 00:24:13.983
My heart is definitely
beating way too hard and stuff.

00:24:14.143 --> 00:24:15.223
And my hands are shaking.

00:24:15.303 --> 00:24:16.343
But I think it's
unrelated, you know?

00:24:16.703 --> 00:24:17.823
It's gonna be great, Luis!

00:24:17.903 --> 00:24:19.023
You got nothing to worry about!

00:24:19.223 --> 00:24:21.703
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

00:24:21.863 --> 00:24:23.063
I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:23.183 --> 00:24:24.623
Daddy!

00:24:30.183 --> 00:24:32.823
Come on, Woo!
I've got three days left.

00:24:32.903 --> 00:24:34.103
Why would I try to escape?

00:24:34.263 --> 00:24:35.983
Sorry, Scott, but
rules are rules.

00:24:36.143 --> 00:24:37.663
You trip the perimeter
alarm, we search the place.

00:24:37.823 --> 00:24:39.463
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

00:24:39.703 --> 00:24:41.223
Thank you.

00:24:41.383 --> 00:24:43.503
It was an accident.
My foot went through the fence.

00:24:43.663 --> 00:24:44.943
Our flying ant crashed.

00:24:45.823 --> 00:24:47.303
Hey, you try and
entertain a 10-year-old

00:24:47.423 --> 00:24:48.423
when you can't leave the house.

00:24:48.623 --> 00:24:50.863
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

00:24:52.063 --> 00:24:53.703
Close-up magic.

00:24:56.623 --> 00:24:57.783
I learned that.

00:24:58.463 --> 00:25:00.343
Why can't you just
leave my daddy alone?

00:25:01.783 --> 00:25:03.503
Oh, Cassie.

00:25:03.663 --> 00:25:05.863
This must all seem
like a bunch of confusing

00:25:05.983 --> 00:25:07.463
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

00:25:07.623 --> 00:25:09.303
Well, think of it this way.

00:25:09.463 --> 00:25:11.183
Your school has rules, right?

00:25:11.263 --> 00:25:13.183
Like, you can't
draw on the walls.

00:25:13.343 --> 00:25:15.263
Well, your daddy went to Germany

00:25:15.343 --> 00:25:17.303
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

00:25:17.463 --> 00:25:19.823
And that was a
violation of Article 16,

00:25:19.903 --> 00:25:22.023
Paragraph Three of
the Sokovia Accords.

00:25:22.183 --> 00:25:23.943
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

00:25:24.103 --> 00:25:26.343
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

00:25:26.543 --> 00:25:28.223
he was allowed to
return to the U.S...

00:25:28.383 --> 00:25:30.703
provided he serve two
years under house arrest...

00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:32.583
followed by three
years of probation.

00:25:32.743 --> 00:25:35.543
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...

00:25:35.703 --> 00:25:37.823
or contact with any former
associates who were...

00:25:37.983 --> 00:25:41.223
or currently are in
violation of said Accords.

00:25:41.383 --> 00:25:42.783
Or any related statutes.

00:25:42.943 --> 00:25:44.223
Okay, sweetie?

00:25:45.303 --> 00:25:47.703
Wow.
You're really great with kids.

00:25:47.903 --> 00:25:49.743
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

00:25:50.343 --> 00:25:52.503
Anyway, not to be
a Johnny ask-a-lot...

00:25:52.663 --> 00:25:53.983
but you haven't had any contact

00:25:54.063 --> 00:25:55.743
with Hank Pym or Hope
Van Dyne, have you?

00:25:55.903 --> 00:25:57.343
- No.
- You sure?

00:25:57.503 --> 00:25:59.383
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get 'em.

00:25:59.543 --> 00:26:02.063
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

00:26:02.223 --> 00:26:05.063
And associating with
them breaks your deal.

00:26:05.223 --> 00:26:07.343
And, uh, I don't
need to remind you...

00:26:07.543 --> 00:26:09.223
that any violation
of your agreement

00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:11.023
means 20 years in prison.
Minimum.

00:26:11.183 --> 00:26:13.663
I haven't talked to
Hank or Hope in forever.

00:26:13.823 --> 00:26:14.943
They hate his guts.

00:26:15.103 --> 00:26:15.823
Thanks, peanut.

00:26:17.623 --> 00:26:18.943
How'd you do it, Scott?

00:26:19.663 --> 00:26:20.703
Do what?

00:26:21.903 --> 00:26:23.823
The card trick.

00:26:24.303 --> 00:26:25.463
Seriously?

00:26:25.863 --> 00:26:27.623
Oh, my God!

00:26:27.783 --> 00:26:30.103
You people can't
just show up here

00:26:30.183 --> 00:26:31.743
whenever you want
and search the place.

00:26:31.943 --> 00:26:32.943
Actually, they can.

00:26:33.103 --> 00:26:33.903
You need a warrant.

00:26:34.063 --> 00:26:35.103
Actually, they don't.

00:26:35.263 --> 00:26:36.783
Really? Wow.

00:26:37.383 --> 00:26:39.023
Did you pack your soccer shoes?

00:26:39.183 --> 00:26:41.303
- Yeah.
- All right.

00:26:41.863 --> 00:26:44.183
Next time I see you
will be on the outside.

00:26:44.343 --> 00:26:45.943
All right.

00:26:46.383 --> 00:26:48.023
Oh, get on the inside of this.

00:26:49.303 --> 00:26:50.823
Hey, three days. Seriously...

00:26:50.983 --> 00:26:52.103
- I'm proud of you, bud.
- Thank you.

00:26:52.263 --> 00:26:53.623
You know what?
Give me another one.

00:26:53.783 --> 00:26:55.863
Me too!
Gosh! Freedom!

00:26:56.023 --> 00:26:58.623
New business!
I am sensing greatness.

00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:00.383
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

00:27:00.543 --> 00:27:02.463
Me too, peanut.
But just wait till next weekend.

00:27:02.623 --> 00:27:03.623
Once I'm outta here,

00:27:03.703 --> 00:27:04.903
you and I are gonna
go paint this town red.

00:27:05.103 --> 00:27:08.343
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

00:27:16.063 --> 00:27:17.223
You're gettin' good at that.

00:27:17.383 --> 00:27:18.423
How'd you do that?

00:27:18.583 --> 00:27:19.463
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

00:27:21.383 --> 00:27:23.023
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:27:26.783 --> 00:27:28.143
Three days.

00:27:28.743 --> 00:27:30.063
Easy-peasy.

00:27:38.303 --> 00:27:41.183
<i>Snap your fingers.
That gets them to look over there.</i>

00:27:41.343 --> 00:27:43.183
<i>And that is misdirection.</i>

00:27:46.863 --> 00:27:48.263
<i>We had a dream</i>

00:27:48.343 --> 00:27:49.983
<i>We'd go travelin' together</i>

00:27:50.143 --> 00:27:53.183
<i>We'd spread a little lovin'
then we'd keep movin' on</i>

00:28:22.343 --> 00:28:25.303
Easy-peasy.

00:28:32.303 --> 00:28:33.823
<i>Where are you?</i>

00:28:42.143 --> 00:28:44.503
<i>Everything that you know...</i>

00:28:48.223 --> 00:28:49.503
<i>Lost...</i>

00:28:49.703 --> 00:28:52.063
<i>in the quantum realm.</i>

00:28:59.263 --> 00:29:00.783
<i>What?</i>

00:29:01.063 --> 00:29:03.263
I'm gonna find you, Jellybean.

00:29:09.023 --> 00:29:10.383
I found you!

00:29:10.503 --> 00:29:13.023
You always find me, Mommy.

00:29:13.463 --> 00:29:15.383
<i>What the hell?</i>

00:29:30.143 --> 00:29:32.423
Hey, Hank!
It's been a while.

00:29:33.343 --> 00:29:37.063
Um, I don't even know if
this is your number anymore.

00:29:37.223 --> 00:29:38.583
And I'm probably the last person

00:29:38.663 --> 00:29:40.223
you wanna hear from.

00:29:41.343 --> 00:29:43.543
But I just had a
really weird dream.

00:29:43.703 --> 00:29:44.823
And I know that doesn't

00:29:44.903 --> 00:29:46.063
sound like an
emergency or anything...

00:29:46.223 --> 00:29:50.383
but it just felt very real.

00:29:50.983 --> 00:29:54.063
I was back in the
quantum realm...

00:29:54.223 --> 00:29:57.223
and I think I saw your wife.

00:29:57.383 --> 00:29:59.343
And then I was your wife.

00:29:59.503 --> 00:30:02.343
I mean, not in a
weird way or anything.

00:30:04.543 --> 00:30:06.863
You know,
hearing this out loud,

00:30:06.943 --> 00:30:09.303
I'm thinking, uh,
it's not an emergency.

00:30:09.463 --> 00:30:11.463
I'm sorry to bother you.

00:30:12.743 --> 00:30:15.103
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

00:31:14.118 --> 00:31:15.758
Nice scuba suit.

00:31:21.278 --> 00:31:23.118
Lighten up, honey, huh?

00:31:23.278 --> 00:31:25.118
Got a smile for me?

00:31:29.358 --> 00:31:30.558
Freak.

00:31:49.918 --> 00:31:53.318
All life on Earth is carbon-based.
Not this guy.

00:31:53.718 --> 00:31:56.118
Whatever he runs on,

00:31:56.198 --> 00:31:57.478
it's not on the periodic table.

00:31:57.638 --> 00:32:00.238
You're saying he's
not from around here?

00:32:01.238 --> 00:32:02.318
Hey, how's your eye?

00:32:03.318 --> 00:32:05.478
Well, I'd say fine...

00:32:05.718 --> 00:32:08.078
but it can't believe
what it's seeing.

00:32:10.718 --> 00:32:15.758
You say this thing
looked like Coulson?

00:32:15.878 --> 00:32:17.758
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

00:32:17.918 --> 00:32:20.638
And the woman said
that there were more?

00:32:20.798 --> 00:32:22.718
The word she used
was "infiltration."

00:32:22.878 --> 00:32:23.918
You believe her?

00:32:24.078 --> 00:32:25.638
Not till I saw this.

00:32:26.478 --> 00:32:28.918
What's your plan?

00:32:29.558 --> 00:32:31.358
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

00:32:31.518 --> 00:32:33.678
I got word on a motorcycle thief

00:32:33.758 --> 00:32:35.118
that fits her description.

00:32:35.678 --> 00:32:37.998
If she can tell us why
these lizards are here...

00:32:38.598 --> 00:32:40.718
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.

00:32:40.918 --> 00:32:41.918
Good.

00:32:43.238 --> 00:32:45.678
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.

00:32:46.838 --> 00:32:48.838
Not even our own men.

00:32:48.998 --> 00:32:50.238
Yes, sir.

00:33:04.678 --> 00:33:07.478
Wow. They're ugly
bastards, aren't they?

00:33:07.798 --> 00:33:11.438
Yeah, well, he's
no Brad Pitt, sir.

00:33:16.278 --> 00:33:18.718
Safe journey to the
beyond, my friend.

00:33:20.638 --> 00:33:23.558
I will finish what we started.

00:33:32.158 --> 00:33:34.158
I wouldn't get too
close there, boss.

00:33:36.158 --> 00:33:37.878
No one in or out.

00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:43.654
<i>That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail could be...</i>

00:33:44.173 --> 00:33:48.413
<i>Could be one,
little, tiny universe.</i>

00:34:17.791 --> 00:34:18.631
Hope?

00:34:21.031 --> 00:34:22.431
Is this another dream?

00:34:22.591 --> 00:34:23.631
Do you think it was a dream...

00:34:23.791 --> 00:34:26.391
or is it possible that you
really saw my mom down there?

00:34:27.071 --> 00:34:28.551
I'm not sure.

00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:33.351
I can't be here!

00:34:33.431 --> 00:34:35.151
I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!

00:34:35.311 --> 00:34:38.151
They won't open while the
system's engaged, Scott.

00:34:57.911 --> 00:35:00.751
You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!

00:35:00.911 --> 00:35:02.031
Relax. As far as your
nanny cops know,

00:35:02.111 --> 00:35:03.231
you're still at home.

00:35:10.031 --> 00:35:11.391
Whoa!

00:35:17.231 --> 00:35:18.231
Scotty?

00:35:18.391 --> 00:35:20.231
<i>He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.</i>

00:35:20.391 --> 00:35:21.751
Nine hours in bed.

00:35:21.951 --> 00:35:23.071
Five hours in front of the TV.

00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:25.351
Two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

00:35:25.511 --> 00:35:26.951
That's totally inaccurate.

00:35:27.111 --> 00:35:28.751
And how do you know
about my daily routine?

00:35:28.831 --> 00:35:29.871
Are you spying on me?

00:35:30.031 --> 00:35:31.711
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

00:35:31.871 --> 00:35:33.911
And so far the biggest
one we've had is you.

00:35:36.951 --> 00:35:39.391
I'm sorry about Germany.
They just showed up.

00:35:39.551 --> 00:35:41.431
They said it was a
matter of national security.

00:35:41.511 --> 00:35:42.751
That Cap needed help, so...

00:35:42.911 --> 00:35:44.151
Cap?

00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:48.031
Tain America. Captain. Cap.

00:35:48.191 --> 00:35:49.991
It's what we call him.

00:35:50.471 --> 00:35:51.631
If you're a friend.

00:35:51.791 --> 00:35:52.911
I'm not saying I'm a friend of...
A little, I know him.

00:35:53.071 --> 00:35:54.151
He's nice. Whatever.

00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:57.271
I'm sorry! All right?
I didn't think I'd get caught.

00:35:57.431 --> 00:35:58.911
You didn't think
about a lot of things.

00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:01.551
How's Hank?

00:36:01.711 --> 00:36:03.711
We're still running.
The house is gone, so is our freedom.

00:36:03.911 --> 00:36:05.111
How do you think he is?

00:36:05.271 --> 00:36:07.111
I'm sorry.
I know you're mad.

00:36:07.271 --> 00:36:08.751
I'm not looking for
an apology, Scott.

00:36:08.911 --> 00:36:10.511
The only reason why
we're even talking is...

00:36:10.671 --> 00:36:12.271
because we need
what's in your head.

00:36:51.111 --> 00:36:53.031
Is this where you're living?

00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:57.431
If you need help or money
or something, maybe I can...

00:36:57.631 --> 00:36:58.951
We're fine.

00:37:56.111 --> 00:37:58.626
Hey, Hank.
Look, I just wanna...

00:37:58.726 --> 00:38:00.166
Save it!

00:38:03.448 --> 00:38:04.798
- Can we start?
- Yeah.

00:38:06.071 --> 00:38:08.311
So, while you were
relaxing at home...

00:38:08.471 --> 00:38:10.871
we were building this.

00:38:11.831 --> 00:38:13.831
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

00:38:14.871 --> 00:38:16.111
To my mom.

00:38:16.271 --> 00:38:17.391
We think she might
still be down there.

00:38:17.471 --> 00:38:18.471
We just don't know where.

00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:19.431
What?

00:38:20.151 --> 00:38:22.151
If we can pinpoint
my mom's location...

00:38:22.311 --> 00:38:24.231
then the pod can take
me down to get her.

00:38:24.431 --> 00:38:25.671
You built all this and
you don't even know

00:38:25.751 --> 00:38:26.951
if she's alive?

00:38:27.111 --> 00:38:29.031
It's called a hypothesis.

00:38:29.191 --> 00:38:31.911
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

00:38:32.071 --> 00:38:34.191
It was overloaded
and it shut down.

00:38:34.391 --> 00:38:35.951
But for a split second,

00:38:36.031 --> 00:38:38.991
the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.

00:38:39.871 --> 00:38:40.951
And?

00:38:41.151 --> 00:38:44.231
And five minutes later, you
called, talking about Mom.

00:38:45.151 --> 00:38:46.151
We think when you
were down there,

00:38:46.231 --> 00:38:47.591
you may have entangled with her.

00:38:47.751 --> 00:38:49.791
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:52.151
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

00:38:52.351 --> 00:38:53.551
We think she might have put

00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:54.871
some kind of a
message in your head.

00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:56.831
Hopefully, a location.

00:38:56.991 --> 00:38:58.591
And opening the
tunnel triggered it.

00:38:58.791 --> 00:39:00.351
Your mom put a
message in my head?

00:39:00.431 --> 00:39:02.071
Come on.
That's insane.

00:39:02.231 --> 00:39:03.271
No, Scott.

00:39:03.431 --> 00:39:05.791
Insane is going to Germany

00:39:05.871 --> 00:39:08.231
without telling us, and
fighting the Avengers.

00:39:08.431 --> 00:39:11.511
Just tell me you weren't
lying about the suit you took.

00:39:11.671 --> 00:39:14.471
Tell me you really destroyed it.

00:39:14.631 --> 00:39:16.831
I did, I destroyed it, I swear.

00:39:16.991 --> 00:39:18.871
I can't believe you
destroyed my suit!

00:39:19.831 --> 00:39:21.391
That was my life's work!

00:39:21.551 --> 00:39:22.791
What was I supposed to do?

00:39:22.951 --> 00:39:25.711
You were supposed
to not take my suit!

00:39:25.871 --> 00:39:26.871
I'm sorry, Hank!

00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:28.431
I'm sorry I took the suit.

00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:30.711
I'm sorry that I
called last night.

00:39:30.911 --> 00:39:32.711
I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.

00:39:32.911 --> 00:39:34.111
I wish that I did.

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:35.191
I just had a dream about her

00:39:35.271 --> 00:39:36.871
playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

00:39:40.271 --> 00:39:41.151
What?

00:39:43.911 --> 00:39:45.351
I had a dream.

00:39:45.551 --> 00:39:48.151
She was playing
hide-and-seek with a little girl.

00:39:48.311 --> 00:39:50.111
Cassie and I do it all the time.

00:39:50.191 --> 00:39:51.471
Doesn't mean anything.

00:39:51.631 --> 00:39:53.591
But was it Cassie in the dream?

00:39:53.751 --> 00:39:54.831
No.

00:39:54.991 --> 00:39:56.111
Where was she hiding?

00:39:56.311 --> 00:39:57.631
- What?
- The little girl.

00:39:57.791 --> 00:39:59.831
Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?

00:40:00.591 --> 00:40:03.151
No, it was in a tall dresser.

00:40:03.311 --> 00:40:04.431
You mean a wardrobe.

00:40:04.591 --> 00:40:05.711
Is that what that's called?

00:40:06.111 --> 00:40:07.551
What color was it?

00:40:08.311 --> 00:40:09.191
Red.

00:40:11.391 --> 00:40:12.911
Were there horses on it?

00:40:13.431 --> 00:40:14.551
Oh, boy.

00:40:15.671 --> 00:40:18.591
It's where I hid every
time that we played.

00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:20.271
It doesn't sound like

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:22.391
you really got the
gist of the game.

00:40:24.151 --> 00:40:25.631
She's alive.

00:40:27.351 --> 00:40:28.991
I knew it.

00:40:29.911 --> 00:40:31.271
I knew it!

00:40:32.831 --> 00:40:34.191
We need to get that part.

00:40:34.351 --> 00:40:35.551
Okay.

00:40:37.591 --> 00:40:38.831
The sooner we get
the tunnel working...

00:40:38.991 --> 00:40:40.471
the sooner we can get this
message out of his head.

00:40:40.631 --> 00:40:41.631
Does Burch have it?

00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:43.151
- Yeah. Let's go.
- What part?

00:40:43.311 --> 00:40:45.431
Who's Burch? Wait.
What's happening?

00:40:46.831 --> 00:40:48.391
We need a component
to stop the tunnel

00:40:48.471 --> 00:40:50.031
from overloading again.

00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:52.751
I grabbed your clothes.
You might want to change.

00:41:02.271 --> 00:41:04.191
Look, I'd really
like to help you...

00:41:05.271 --> 00:41:06.351
but if I'm not at
home when they come

00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:07.471
to take off my ankle monitor...

00:41:07.671 --> 00:41:09.111
then I'm going away forever.

00:41:09.271 --> 00:41:11.231
Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel...

00:41:11.391 --> 00:41:13.231
we'll get the message, and
have you home by lunch.

00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:15.591
We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.

00:41:15.751 --> 00:41:16.751
You owe us.

00:41:17.431 --> 00:41:19.231
All right, fine.
But can I just wait inside?

00:41:19.431 --> 00:41:20.751
Because I'm not
supposed to be out here.

00:41:31.071 --> 00:41:32.391
Let's go.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.820
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:51.900
You're totally rambling.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.020
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.220
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.420
and in the dream you gotta pee.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.620
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.900
And then you're
like, "Oh, my God.

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.140
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.220
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.340
"Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants."

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.500
And then you wake
up and in real life

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.620
you actually have to pee.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.700
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.900
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.780
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:12.140
Apropos of that, last
night I dreamt we had a kid.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.900
It was so real.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.620
We named him after
your eccentric uncle.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.700
Uh, what was his name?

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.140
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.940
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.660
...and thought that we were...

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:23.860
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:24.940
- Yes?
- No.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.500
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.020
If you wanted to have a kid...

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.100
you wouldn't have done that.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.660
I'm glad you brought
this up, 'cause it's nothing.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.220
It's just a housing
unit for nanoparticles.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.820
You're not helping
your case, okay?

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.020
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.660
You don't need that.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.060
I know, I had the surgery.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.220
I'm just trying to protect us...

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.020
and future usses and that's it.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.700
Just in case there's a
monster in the closet.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.780
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.900
You know me so well.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.700
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.140
You should have
shirts in your closet.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.500
Yeah.

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.060
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.420
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.660
Show off this Harry Winston.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.100
Right?
And we should have no more surprises. Ever.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.300
I should promise you.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.780
- Yes.
- I will.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.220
Thank you.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.500
Tony Stark.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.700
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.260
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.220
I'm sorry, you giving
out tickets to something?

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.820
We need your help.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.180
It's not overselling
it to say that

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.860
the fate of the
universe is at stake.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.460
And who's "we"?

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:32.260
Hey, Tony.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.420
Bruce.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.220
- Pepper.
- Hi.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.820
- Oh.
- You okay?

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.820
At the dawn of the universe,

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.820
there was nothing. Then...

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.500
Boom.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.380
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.380
hurtling across
the virgin universe.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:56.980
These Infinity Stones

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.980
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.100
Space.

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.420
Reality.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.180
Power.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.580
Soul.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.860
Mind.

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.020
And Time.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:25.820
Tell me his name again.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.180
Thanos.

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:28.620
He's a plague, Tony.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.580
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:32.900
He wipes out half
the population.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.780
He sent Loki.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.300
The attack on New York,
that's him.

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.020
This is it.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.180
What's our timeline?

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.500
No telling.
He has the Power and Space Stones.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.660
That already makes him

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.260
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.700
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:51.940
He could destroy life

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.060
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.060
Did you seriously just
say "hitherto undreamt of"?

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.300
Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.980
Is that what it is?

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.620
I'm going to allow that.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:08.300
If Thanos needs all
six, why don't we just

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:09.740
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:10.940
No can do.

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.820
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.140
And I swore off dairy...

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.700
but then Ben &amp; Jerry's
named a flavor after me.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:19.300
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.860
A bit chalky.

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:22.580
A Hunk of Hulk of Burning
Fudge is our favorite.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:23.860
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.100
Point is, things change.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.020
Our oath to protect the
Time Stone cannot change.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.220
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.420
Yeah, so conversely,

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.300
it may also be his
best chance against us.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.820
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.980
What is your job exactly?

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.700
Besides making balloon animals.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.380
Protecting your
reality, douchebag.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:44.060
Okay, guys.
Could we table this discussion right now?

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.100
The fact is we have this stone.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.460
We know where it is.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.180
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.060
and we have to find him now.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.260
Yeah, that's the thing.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.340
What do you mean?

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.660
Two weeks ago, Vision
turned off his transponder.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.820
He's offline.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:00.220
- What?
- Yeah.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.300
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.740
I didn't lose him.
He's more than that. He's evolving.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.340
Who could find Vision then?

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.380
Shit.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.020
Probably Steve Rogers.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.380
Oh, great.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.020
Maybe.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:16.660
But...

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.260
Call him.

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.300
It's not that easy.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.180
God, we haven't caught
up in a spell, have we?

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.340
No.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.100
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.780
Broke up?

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.580
Like a band? Like...
Like the Beatles?

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.700
Cap and I fell out hard.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.860
We're not on speaking terms.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.820
Tony, listen to me.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.220
Thor's gone.

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.100
Thanos is coming.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.820
It doesn't matter who
you're talking to or not.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:08.100
Flip phone.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.380
Say, Doc, you
wouldn't happen to be

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.660
moving your hair, would ya?

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:34.820
Not at the moment, no.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.340
You okay?

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:11.500
- Help him!
- Banner!

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.220
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:14.460
Friday, what am I looking at?

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.860
<i>Not sure. I'm working on it.</i>

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.060
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.380
in your back pocket, Doc!

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:20.740
Might wanna use it.

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.460
Ned, hey.
I need you to cause a distraction.

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:51.940
Holy shit.

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.780
We're all gonna die!

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.140
There's a spaceship!

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.020
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.660
What's the matter with you kids?

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.540
You never seen a
spaceship before?

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.140
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.220
Notify first responders.

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:25.540
<i>Will do.</i>

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.820
Hear me and rejoice.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.660
You are about to die

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.820
at the hands of the
Children of Thanos.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:04.420
Be thankful...

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.140
that your meaningless
lives are now contributing...

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.260
I'm sorry, Earth
is closed today.

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:13.140
You better pack it
up and get outta here.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.460
Stonekeeper.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.660
Does this chattering
animal speak for you?

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.620
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.500
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.940
He means get lost, Squidward.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.300
He exhausts me.

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.420
Bring me the stone.

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.500
Banner, you want a piece?

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.860
Mmm, no, not really.

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.260
But when do I ever
get what I want?

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.420
That's right.

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.340
Okay. Push!

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.980
It's been a while.

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:41.620
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:42.780
Okay. Shh.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.620
Let me just...
I need to concentrate here for a second.

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:47.100
Come on, come on, man.

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.420
God!

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.820
Where's your guy?

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.620
I don't know.
We've sorta been having a thing.

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:55.820
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.420
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:05.820
Dude, you're embarrassing
me in front of the wizards.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.900
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:08.980
It's okay.

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.460
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:12.940
- I have him.
- Damn it.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:41.820
Where'd that come from?

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:43.020
It's nanotech.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.140
You like it?
A little something I...

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.220
Doctor Banner, if the
rest of your green friend

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.460
won't be joining us...

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.380
Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.820
It stays with me.

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:04.940
Exactly. Bye.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:15.900
Tony, you okay?

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:18.020
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- Really, really good.

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.220
Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:20.700
I'm trying. He won't come out.

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:23.660
 Hammer.

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:34.300
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.580
Come out! Come out! Come out!

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.940
No!

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.620
What do you mean, "no"?

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.020
Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:54.980
- Kid, where'd you come from?
- A field trip to MoMA.

00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:58.460
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.660
Uh, he's from space.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.700
He came here to steal a
necklace from a wizard.

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.180
Your powers are quaint.

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.020
You must be
popular with children.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:37.780
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.900
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:58.020
You'll find removing a dead
man's spell troublesome.

00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.900
You'll only wish you were dead.

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.140
No!

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.820
Kid, that's the wizard.
Get on it.

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:18.500
On it!

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:27.300
Not cool.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:32.580
Gotcha!

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:34.780
Wait!

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.420
Uh, Mr. Stark, I'm
being beamed up.

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:46.860
 Hang on, kid.

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:03.940
Oh!

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:06.740
Ugh.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.580
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.260
Give me a little juice, Friday.

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.580
Unlock 17:A.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.220
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.420
But you said save the wizard!

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:45.860
I can't breathe.

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:48.820
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:52.020
Yeah. That makes sense.

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.220
Mr. Stark, it smells like
a new car in here!

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:12.420
Happy trails, kid.

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:13.940
- Friday, send him home.
<i>- Yep.</i>

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:16.340
Oh, come on!

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.780
<i>Boss, incoming
call from Miss Potts.</i>

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:27.940
<i>Tony?
Oh, my God.</i>

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:29.020
<i>Are you all right?
What's going on?</i>

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:30.460
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:31.860
we might have to
push our 8:30 res.

00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:33.020
<i>Why?</i>

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:34.620
Just 'cause I'll probably

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.100
not make it back for a while.

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.460
<i>Tell me you're
not on that ship.</i>

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:39.540
Yeah.

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:40.940
<i>God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.</i>

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.700
Honey, I'm sorry.

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:44.020
I'm sorry, I don't
know what to say.

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:45.380
<i>Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.</i>

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.620
- Pep.
<i>- Come back here right now.</i>

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:48.740
<i>Come back.</i>

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:50.820
<i>Boss, we're losing her.</i>

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.060
<i>I'm going too.</i>

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.380
Oh, my God!

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:09.820
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.540
Where you going?

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.220
The Time Stone's been taken.

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.300
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:31.380
What will you do?

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:33.820
I'm gonna make a call.
