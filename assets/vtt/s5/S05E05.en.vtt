00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:40.682
I thought you might be hungry.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.719
I always hated that chair.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.959
So I've been told.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:01.519
Even so, I'd hoped
you'd sit in it one day.

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:03.839
I hated this room.

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:05.999
This ship.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.959
I hated my life.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.639
You told me that too.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.159
Every day.

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:23.919
For almost 20 years.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.879
I was a child when you took me.

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.119
I saved you.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:35.599
No.

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.639
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.999
Going to bed hungry...

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.199
scrounging for scraps.

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.239
Your planet was on
the brink of collapse.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.399
I'm the one who stopped that.

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:51.719
Do you know what's
happened since then?

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:53.519
The children born...

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.519
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:58.919
It's a paradise.

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.479
Because you murdered
half the planet.

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.519
A small price to
pay for salvation.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:07.679
You're insane.

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:09.799
Little one, it's a
simple calculus.

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.759
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.319
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:18.799
It needs correction.

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.359
You don't know that!

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.959
I'm the only one who knows that.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.959
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.519
For a time...

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:38.359
you had that same will...

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.399
as you fought by my side.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.319
Daughter.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.879
I'm not your daughter.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.039
Everything I hate about
myself you taught me.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.279
And, in doing so,

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.599
made you the fiercest
woman in the galaxy.

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.359
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.199
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:11.519
I am disappointed.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.799
But not because
you didn't find it.

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.119
But because you did.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.359
And you lied.

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.559
Nebula.

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:50.159
Don't do this.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.519
Some time ago,

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.319
your sister snuck
aboard this ship to kill me.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.479
Please don't do this.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.879
And very nearly succeeded.

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:59.999
So I brought her here.

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:02.799
To talk.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.839
Stop. Stop it.

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.079
I swear to you on my life.

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:23.839
I never found the Soul Stone.

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:29.559
<i>Accessing memory files.</i>

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.079
<i>You know what he's about to do.</i>

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:33.839
<i>He's finally ready, and
he's going for the stones.</i>

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:35.119
<i>- All of them.</i>
<i>- He can never get them all.</i>

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:36.239
<i>He will!</i>

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.279
<i>He can't, Nebula.</i>

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.799
<i>Because I found the
map to the Soul Stone...</i>

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:43.759
<i>and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.</i>

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:50.599
You're strong.

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:53.639
Me.

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:57.799
You're generous.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.159
Me.

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.559
But I never taught you to lie.

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:07.359
That's why you're so bad at it.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:14.119
Where is the Soul Stone?

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:32.519
Vormir!

00:05:50.748 --> 00:05:52.348
The stone is on Vormir.

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.799
Show me.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.750
I need you to meet me on Titan.

00:07:30.024 --> 00:07:32.624
In all the time I've
served Thanos...

00:07:34.504 --> 00:07:36.504
I have never failed him.

00:07:41.584 --> 00:07:44.664
If I were to reach our
rendezvous on Titan...

00:07:44.824 --> 00:07:46.424
with the Time Stone
still attached

00:07:46.504 --> 00:07:48.664
to your vaguely
irritating person...

00:07:48.824 --> 00:07:51.424
there would be judgment.

00:07:59.922 --> 00:08:01.442
Give me...

00:08:05.602 --> 00:08:06.602
the stone.

00:08:18.984 --> 00:08:20.224
Wow, you're a seriously

00:08:20.344 --> 00:08:21.424
loyal piece of
outerwear, aren't you?

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.624
Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...

00:08:24.144 --> 00:08:25.144
What the...

00:08:25.344 --> 00:08:27.064
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

00:08:27.264 --> 00:08:28.304
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

00:08:28.464 --> 00:08:29.464
But it was such a long
way down and I just thought

00:08:29.544 --> 00:08:30.784
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.

00:08:30.864 --> 00:08:31.864
...and kinda stuck
to the side of the ship.

00:08:32.024 --> 00:08:34.104
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.264
God damn it.

00:08:35.424 --> 00:08:38.224
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:39.704
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

00:08:39.864 --> 00:08:41.184
And now, I'm here in space.

00:08:41.344 --> 00:08:43.784
Yeah, right where I
didn't want you to be.

00:08:43.944 --> 00:08:46.024
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

00:08:46.184 --> 00:08:47.424
This is a one-way ticket.

00:08:47.504 --> 00:08:49.064
You hear me?
Don't pretend you thought this through.

00:08:49.144 --> 00:08:50.144
No, I did think this through.

00:08:50.224 --> 00:08:51.864
You could not have
possibly thought this through.

00:08:52.024 --> 00:08:53.544
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

00:08:53.704 --> 00:08:55.264
if there's no neighborhood.

00:08:57.464 --> 00:08:58.584
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,

00:08:58.664 --> 00:08:59.984
but you know what
I'm trying to say.

00:09:02.797 --> 00:09:04.984
Come on.
We got a situation.

00:09:05.984 --> 00:09:06.984
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

00:09:07.064 --> 00:09:08.064
What's your plan?

00:09:08.184 --> 00:09:09.344
- Go.
- Um...

00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:11.424
Okay, okay...
Uh...

00:09:11.602 --> 00:09:14.802
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, <i>Aliens?</i>

00:09:18.604 --> 00:09:20.684
Painful, aren't they?

00:09:21.484 --> 00:09:24.444
They were originally
designed for microsurgery.

00:09:25.124 --> 00:09:27.204
And any one of them...

00:09:32.284 --> 00:09:34.484
could end your
friend's life in an instant.

00:09:34.784 --> 00:09:36.724
I gotta tell you, he's
not really my friend.

00:09:36.884 --> 00:09:39.564
Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.

00:09:41.364 --> 00:09:43.084
You've saved nothing.

00:09:43.964 --> 00:09:45.964
Your powers are inconsequential

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.284
compared to mine.

00:09:47.684 --> 00:09:49.324
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

00:10:03.484 --> 00:10:05.644
Yes! Wait. What are those?

00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:22.886
Hey, we haven't officially met.

00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:25.404
Cool.

00:10:27.404 --> 00:10:28.844
We gotta turn this ship around.

00:10:28.964 --> 00:10:31.004
Yeah, now he wants to run.
Great plan.

00:10:31.204 --> 00:10:32.564
No, I want to protect the stone.

00:10:32.724 --> 00:10:33.924
And I want you to thank me.

00:10:34.004 --> 00:10:35.524
Now, go ahead.
I'm listening.

00:10:35.684 --> 00:10:38.404
For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

00:10:38.564 --> 00:10:40.804
Who just saved your magical ass?
Me.

00:10:41.004 --> 00:10:42.004
I seriously don't know

00:10:42.084 --> 00:10:43.244
how you fit your
head into that helmet.

00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:45.644
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

00:10:45.844 --> 00:10:47.324
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

00:10:47.484 --> 00:10:49.404
Unlike everyone else in
your life, I don't work for you.

00:10:49.564 --> 00:10:51.164
And due to that fact,

00:10:51.244 --> 00:10:52.564
we're now in a
flying doughnut...

00:10:52.764 --> 00:10:54.404
billions of miles from
Earth with no backup.

00:10:54.564 --> 00:10:56.484
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

00:10:56.684 --> 00:10:57.684
The adults are talking.

00:10:57.844 --> 00:11:00.404
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:02.204
What is he, your ward?

00:11:02.404 --> 00:11:03.364
No.

00:11:03.884 --> 00:11:05.764
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

00:11:05.924 --> 00:11:07.644
Oh, you're using our
made-up names. Um...

00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:09.781
I'm Spider-Man, then.

00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:12.229
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

00:11:12.364 --> 00:11:13.364
Thing's on autopilot.

00:11:13.524 --> 00:11:15.244
Can we control it?

00:11:15.404 --> 00:11:17.324
Fly us home?

00:11:20.324 --> 00:11:21.324
- Stark?
- Yeah.

00:11:21.413 --> 00:11:22.653
Can you get us home?

00:11:22.884 --> 00:11:24.164
Yeah, I heard you.

00:11:25.444 --> 00:11:27.924
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:30.084
Under no circumstances

00:11:30.164 --> 00:11:32.724
can we bring the
Time Stone to Thanos.

00:11:32.884 --> 00:11:34.044
I don't think you
quite understand

00:11:34.124 --> 00:11:35.124
what's at stake here.

00:11:35.284 --> 00:11:37.644
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

00:11:37.804 --> 00:11:40.564
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

00:11:40.724 --> 00:11:42.284
Since he sent an
army to New York

00:11:42.364 --> 00:11:43.924
and now he's back.

00:11:44.084 --> 00:11:46.004
And I don't know what to do.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.364
So I'm not so sure

00:11:47.444 --> 00:11:49.204
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

00:11:49.404 --> 00:11:53.004
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

00:11:53.204 --> 00:11:55.404
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:58.324
So I say we take
the fight to him.

00:11:58.484 --> 00:11:59.484
Doctor.

00:12:01.204 --> 00:12:02.844
Do you concur?

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:07.924
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

00:12:09.004 --> 00:12:11.044
But you have to understand...

00:12:11.204 --> 00:12:12.884
if it comes to saving you

00:12:12.964 --> 00:12:15.404
or the kid or the Time Stone...

00:12:15.564 --> 00:12:18.404
I will not hesitate to
let either of you die.

00:12:19.244 --> 00:12:22.924
I can't, because the
universe depends on it.

00:12:23.484 --> 00:12:26.364
Nice.
Good, moral compass.

00:12:27.527 --> 00:12:29.007
We're straight.

00:12:30.222 --> 00:12:31.702
All right, kid.

00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:34.124
You're an Avenger now.

00:12:48.209 --> 00:12:51.209
<i>I know I don't
deserve your trust...</i>

00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:53.569
but you were our only lead.

00:12:53.729 --> 00:12:55.969
We discovered that
your energy signature

00:12:56.089 --> 00:12:58.809
matched Mar-Vell's core.

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:01.489
Now we know why.

00:13:03.329 --> 00:13:07.289
If only you knew the
importance of it to me.

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:10.129
I just need your help

00:13:10.209 --> 00:13:13.769
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:17.489
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

00:13:17.689 --> 00:13:19.609
For orbital position
and velocity.

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:21.489
You didn't find
her lab on Earth,

00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:22.809
'cause it's not on Earth.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.049
That was the location

00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:25.209
on the date of the
crash six years ago.

00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:26.769
If we track its course,

00:13:26.849 --> 00:13:29.169
we'll find it in
orbit right now.

00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:31.009
It's just basic physics.

00:13:33.489 --> 00:13:34.489
In orbit?

00:13:36.409 --> 00:13:37.969
Was that so
difficult to figure out?

00:13:38.169 --> 00:13:40.369
I mean, you're my
science guy, right?

00:13:41.089 --> 00:13:43.569
Yon-Rogg will
catch up to me soon.

00:13:43.729 --> 00:13:46.329
We've got to get to
the core before he does.

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:48.209
Mmm. We're going to space?

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:49.369
In what?

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:51.169
A few tweaks to your
vessel should do it.

00:13:51.329 --> 00:13:53.449
I can handle the modifications.

00:13:53.649 --> 00:13:55.289
Mmm. Your science guy.

00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:03.511
Well, I could use a copilot.

00:14:05.089 --> 00:14:07.529
No.
No, I can't.

00:14:07.689 --> 00:14:09.569
I can't leave Monica.

00:14:09.729 --> 00:14:12.529
Mom, it's okay.
I can stay with Gramma and Paw-paw.

00:14:13.089 --> 00:14:15.169
There's no way I'm going, baby.
It's too dangerous.

00:14:15.329 --> 00:14:17.249
Testing brand-new
aerospace tech is dangerous...

00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:18.449
and you used to do that.

00:14:20.201 --> 00:14:22.081
Your plan is to
leave the atmosphere

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:23.561
in a craft not designed
for the journey...

00:14:23.721 --> 00:14:25.321
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:26.561
with a technologically-superior

00:14:26.641 --> 00:14:27.641
foreign enemy.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.481
Correct?

00:14:29.681 --> 00:14:30.641
That's what I'm saying.

00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:32.001
- You have to go!
- Monica!

00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:33.241
You have a chance to
fly the coolest mission

00:14:33.321 --> 00:14:34.441
in the history of missions...

00:14:34.641 --> 00:14:36.361
and you're gonna give
it up to sit on the couch

00:14:36.441 --> 00:14:37.721
and watch <i>Fresh Prince</i> with me?

00:14:38.481 --> 00:14:39.441
What?

00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:40.681
I just think you
should consider...

00:14:40.841 --> 00:14:44.121
what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.

00:14:51.721 --> 00:14:53.041
What's going on around here?

00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:54.241
I know, I know.

00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:55.801
I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:03.081
Your mom's lucky.

00:15:03.241 --> 00:15:04.521
When they were handing out kids,

00:15:04.601 --> 00:15:06.281
they gave her the toughest one.

00:15:06.881 --> 00:15:07.881
Lieutenant Trouble.

00:15:08.881 --> 00:15:10.401
You remembered.

00:15:11.881 --> 00:15:13.201
Is that mine?

00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:15.521
No, no.

00:15:16.241 --> 00:15:18.441
You hang on to it
until I come back.

00:15:19.081 --> 00:15:21.521
But there is something
that I need your help with.

00:15:21.721 --> 00:15:24.321
I can't wear these
Kree colors anymore.

00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:27.561
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

00:15:27.641 --> 00:15:29.481
with any sense of style...

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.700
Hmm?

00:15:33.961 --> 00:15:35.001
Whoa.

00:15:37.561 --> 00:15:38.761
No.

00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:42.121
Uh-uh.

00:15:43.561 --> 00:15:45.161
Definitely not.

00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:50.481
Well, since we're
on the same team...

00:16:01.601 --> 00:16:02.761
Hmm.

00:16:04.292 --> 00:16:05.892
How do I look?

00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:10.561
Fresh.

00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:31.681
What took you so long?

00:16:32.521 --> 00:16:34.801
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

00:16:35.481 --> 00:16:37.841
- PRY46-B...
- No, no codes.

00:16:38.041 --> 00:16:39.761
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:42.481
Okay, then let's do this.

00:16:43.201 --> 00:16:46.401
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

00:16:46.561 --> 00:16:49.241
The person you most
admire and respect, I'd guess.

00:16:49.651 --> 00:16:50.851
But you would never tell me who.

00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:55.281
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

00:16:55.441 --> 00:16:56.921
The transfusion.

00:16:57.121 --> 00:16:59.201
Blue blood running
through my veins.

00:16:59.361 --> 00:17:00.361
Whose blood?

00:17:03.417 --> 00:17:04.457
Hmm.

00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:15.521
That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:21.669
What have you done with her?

00:17:21.759 --> 00:17:23.719
You're too late.

00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:41.321
She knows?

00:17:56.094 --> 00:17:59.320
Ronan, Skrulls have
infiltrated C-53.

00:17:59.477 --> 00:18:00.477
Come at once.

00:18:00.568 --> 00:18:02.648
<i>For the good of all
Kree, Commander...</i>

00:18:02.793 --> 00:18:05.593
<i>the infestation
will be eradicated.</i>

00:18:07.932 --> 00:18:09.772
Passing 500 and climbing.

00:18:12.772 --> 00:18:16.132
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

00:18:16.292 --> 00:18:19.492
Our little alliance with
you is tenuous at best.

00:18:19.652 --> 00:18:22.372
And as long as he
continues to freak you out...

00:18:22.448 --> 00:18:23.503
like that...

00:18:23.582 --> 00:18:26.292
yeah, I'm gonna keep giving him

00:18:26.372 --> 00:18:29.212
all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?

00:18:29.372 --> 00:18:30.932
Can I ask you something?

00:18:31.132 --> 00:18:33.212
Do you just turn into
anything you want?

00:18:33.372 --> 00:18:35.052
Ah, well, I have
to see it first.

00:18:35.212 --> 00:18:36.292
Can you all do it?

00:18:36.732 --> 00:18:38.492
Physiologically? Yeah.

00:18:38.652 --> 00:18:40.852
But, uh, it takes practice...

00:18:41.012 --> 00:18:44.732
and, um, dare I say it,
talent to do it well.

00:18:44.932 --> 00:18:47.372
- Can you turn into a cat?
- What's a cat?

00:18:47.462 --> 00:18:48.542
What about a filing cabinet?

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:52.132
Why would I turn
into a filing cabinet?

00:18:52.292 --> 00:18:53.412
A Venus flytrap?

00:18:53.572 --> 00:18:54.572
I'll give you 50 bucks right now

00:18:54.652 --> 00:18:55.852
if you turn into
a Venus flytrap.

00:18:55.932 --> 00:18:57.612
Switching engines

00:18:57.692 --> 00:18:59.972
from Scramjet to Fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

00:19:09.172 --> 00:19:10.172
Hey.

00:19:10.332 --> 00:19:12.812
Is this normal, like,
space turbulence?

00:19:12.932 --> 00:19:13.892
Pretty much.

00:19:47.784 --> 00:19:49.784
Locking in on coordinate grid.

00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:51.601
Where is it?

00:19:54.791 --> 00:19:57.551
It's here. It's gotta be here.

00:19:57.892 --> 00:20:03.132
Well, is it in front of all
that nothing, or behind it?

00:20:08.692 --> 00:20:10.692
<i>Decloaking activated.</i>

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:15.452
Is that it? The core?

00:21:15.612 --> 00:21:17.892
In her notes she
called it the Tesseract.

00:21:24.052 --> 00:21:25.132
Whoa.

00:21:26.481 --> 00:21:28.721
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

00:21:42.679 --> 00:21:43.719
We're not alone.

00:22:06.848 --> 00:22:08.168
Talos!

00:22:18.292 --> 00:22:21.172
He didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

00:22:43.732 --> 00:22:44.972
It's okay.

00:22:49.932 --> 00:22:51.532
We didn't know what to do.

00:22:51.732 --> 00:22:55.012
Mar-Vell warned us not to
send a signal for any reason...

00:22:55.172 --> 00:22:56.452
or the Kree would find us.

00:22:56.892 --> 00:22:59.012
You did the right thing.

00:23:08.612 --> 00:23:09.852
It's okay, it's okay.

00:23:10.412 --> 00:23:12.492
She's all right.
She's a friend.

00:23:14.532 --> 00:23:16.172
I am not gonna hurt you.

00:23:16.452 --> 00:23:18.332
She led me to you.

00:23:19.092 --> 00:23:20.572
I'm so sorry.

00:23:22.292 --> 00:23:23.532
I didn't know.

00:23:23.692 --> 00:23:24.732
Carol.

00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:27.532
This is war.

00:23:28.372 --> 00:23:31.732
My hands are
filthy from it, too.

00:23:32.532 --> 00:23:34.292
But we're here now.

00:23:34.732 --> 00:23:37.772
You found my family.

00:23:40.812 --> 00:23:41.972
This is just the beginning.

00:23:42.772 --> 00:23:45.652
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

00:23:46.772 --> 00:23:49.492
scattered throughout the galaxy.

00:24:07.252 --> 00:24:09.452
If I played the same pinball
machine for six years...

00:24:09.612 --> 00:24:11.532
I'd have some high scores, too.

00:24:14.172 --> 00:24:16.452
Fraternizing with the enemy?

00:24:16.532 --> 00:24:17.692
Uh-uh.

00:24:29.772 --> 00:24:31.732
What did you do to your uniform?

00:24:31.892 --> 00:24:33.892
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

00:24:34.052 --> 00:24:35.732
The Supreme Intelligence
will set her straight.

00:24:35.892 --> 00:24:37.292
You can see
they're not soldiers.

00:24:37.492 --> 00:24:39.772
Let 'em go. You can have me.

00:24:39.932 --> 00:24:41.132
And the core?

00:24:41.612 --> 00:24:42.932
You lied to me.

00:24:43.132 --> 00:24:47.052
I made you the best
version of yourself.

00:24:50.492 --> 00:24:53.412
What's given can be taken away.

00:25:07.252 --> 00:25:08.252
Back here! Move, move!

00:25:08.372 --> 00:25:10.852
Get over here. Get down!

00:25:11.492 --> 00:25:14.052
Let's go! Go, move!

00:25:53.663 --> 00:25:54.663
There she is.

00:25:55.132 --> 00:25:58.692
Seems like your time on
C-53 jogged the old memory.

00:25:59.572 --> 00:26:00.772
This jacket.

00:26:01.412 --> 00:26:03.412
It's killer, by the way.

00:26:04.579 --> 00:26:05.979
Oh.

00:26:06.349 --> 00:26:08.349
The music. It's a nice touch.

00:26:08.652 --> 00:26:10.292
Let me out.

00:26:10.538 --> 00:26:11.938
No can do.

00:26:12.412 --> 00:26:16.132
If you hurt them, I will
burn you to the ground.

00:26:16.292 --> 00:26:18.052
With what exactly?

00:26:18.212 --> 00:26:19.532
Your power comes from us.

00:26:19.732 --> 00:26:21.452
You didn't give me these powers.

00:26:21.652 --> 00:26:22.692
The blast did.

00:26:22.852 --> 00:26:24.092
And yet, you've
never had the strength

00:26:24.172 --> 00:26:25.292
to control them on your own.

00:26:36.732 --> 00:26:38.372
<i>Species: Flerken.</i>

00:26:38.452 --> 00:26:40.012
<i>Threat: high.</i>

00:26:45.372 --> 00:26:47.252
It's a cat, not Hannibal Lecter.

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:52.215
<i>Species: human male.</i>

00:26:52.532 --> 00:26:54.772
<i>Threat: low to none.</i>

00:26:55.972 --> 00:26:57.252
That thing's clearly busted.

00:26:57.412 --> 00:26:59.532
Load the Flerken
onto the <i>Helion.</i>

00:27:00.332 --> 00:27:02.292
Eject the others into space.

00:27:05.172 --> 00:27:07.212
You did good, Ace.

00:27:08.852 --> 00:27:09.852
Thanks to you...

00:27:10.012 --> 00:27:11.972
those insidious shapeshifters

00:27:12.052 --> 00:27:13.612
will threaten our
borders no more.

00:27:13.772 --> 00:27:16.012
I used to believe your lies...

00:27:16.172 --> 00:27:18.812
but the Skrulls are
just fighting for a home.

00:27:18.972 --> 00:27:20.532
You're talking about
destroying them

00:27:20.612 --> 00:27:22.212
because they won't
submit to your rule.

00:27:22.412 --> 00:27:23.492
And neither will I.

00:27:23.652 --> 00:27:26.812
We found you.
We embraced you as our own.

00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:28.335
You stole me.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.160
From my home,
my family, my friends.

00:27:39.412 --> 00:27:41.292
It's cute how hard you try.

00:27:43.412 --> 00:27:45.092
But remember...

00:27:46.412 --> 00:27:47.652
without us...

00:27:47.812 --> 00:27:48.892
<i>Give it up, Carol.</i>

00:27:50.612 --> 00:27:51.812
<i>Stay down!</i>

00:27:51.972 --> 00:27:53.052
...you're weak.

00:27:53.572 --> 00:27:55.292
<i>You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!</i>

00:27:55.492 --> 00:27:56.812
You're flawed.

00:27:56.972 --> 00:27:58.172
<i>Are you trying to kill yourself?</i>

00:27:59.061 --> 00:28:00.061
Helpless.

00:28:00.212 --> 00:28:01.332
<i>You're too emotional
and so weak.</i>

00:28:01.692 --> 00:28:03.132
<i>You don't belong out here!</i>

00:28:03.812 --> 00:28:05.252
We saved you.

00:28:05.452 --> 00:28:06.932
<i>- Control it.</i>
<i>- I told you,</i>

00:28:07.012 --> 00:28:08.012
<i>- Carol.</i>
<i>- They'll never</i>

00:28:08.132 --> 00:28:09.092
<i>- let you fly.</i>
<i>- This ain't</i>

00:28:09.212 --> 00:28:10.292
<i>- a game for little girls.</i>
<i>- You kiss like a horse.</i>

00:28:10.372 --> 00:28:11.372
<i> You won't last a week, Danvers.</i>

00:28:14.572 --> 00:28:17.652
Without us, you're only human.

00:28:19.132 --> 00:28:20.372
You're right.

00:28:21.612 --> 00:28:23.732
I'm only human.

00:28:57.692 --> 00:29:01.052
On Hala, you were reborn...

00:29:01.212 --> 00:29:02.572
Vers.

00:29:07.572 --> 00:29:10.492
My name is Carol.

00:29:25.252 --> 00:29:26.852
She's trying to break out.

00:30:11.172 --> 00:30:14.492
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

00:30:15.452 --> 00:30:17.012
But what happens when...

00:30:20.172 --> 00:30:22.212
I'm finally set free?

00:31:02.692 --> 00:31:05.252
You know you're glowing, right?

00:31:05.412 --> 00:31:06.412
I'll explain it later.

00:31:09.132 --> 00:31:10.292
Take the Tesseract.

00:31:10.452 --> 00:31:11.572
Leave the lunchbox.

00:31:11.772 --> 00:31:13.252
- Me?
- Yes.

00:31:13.412 --> 00:31:14.772
I'm not touching that thing.

00:31:14.932 --> 00:31:16.012
You want me to get
you an oven mitt?

00:31:21.852 --> 00:31:23.052
Whoa!

00:31:29.692 --> 00:31:32.212
Get the Skrulls on
the Quadjet and go.

00:31:32.372 --> 00:31:34.492
Take the Flerken with you.

00:31:35.212 --> 00:31:36.892
- What about you?
- I'll buy you some time!

00:31:38.812 --> 00:31:40.652
I'm picking you up now.

00:31:43.772 --> 00:31:46.292
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

00:31:51.742 --> 00:31:52.742
Oh, hey, guys.

00:31:56.372 --> 00:31:58.052
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

00:32:01.172 --> 00:32:03.052
I used to find you amusing.

00:32:03.772 --> 00:32:04.772
Let's put an end to this.

00:32:40.212 --> 00:32:41.172
Okay.

00:32:41.652 --> 00:32:42.852

00:34:24.464 --> 00:34:25.584
Pick a side.

00:34:29.784 --> 00:34:31.664
Take them to the hangar, too.

00:34:31.824 --> 00:34:33.624
We'll blast them all into space.

00:35:01.864 --> 00:35:03.144
Follow my lead.

00:35:07.144 --> 00:35:08.144

00:35:17.019 --> 00:35:18.184

00:35:43.371 --> 00:35:44.769
Nice diversion.

00:35:45.304 --> 00:35:47.064
I could have swore
I put it in there.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.259
Minn-Erva, take them
down in the drop ship.

00:36:46.344 --> 00:36:47.424
On it.

00:36:52.104 --> 00:36:53.224
You all right, friend?

00:36:54.217 --> 00:36:56.137
Never better.

00:37:00.595 --> 00:37:02.395
We got a bogey coming in hot.

00:38:42.704 --> 00:38:44.344
Yes! Boom!

00:39:00.164 --> 00:39:01.364
Whoo!

00:39:04.904 --> 00:39:06.224
What the hell was that?

00:39:29.546 --> 00:39:31.666
Deploy ballistic warheads.

00:40:24.024 --> 00:40:25.424
That's impossible.

00:40:25.584 --> 00:40:27.984
C-53 doesn't have
a defense system

00:40:28.064 --> 00:40:30.704
advanced enough to
destroy our warheads.

00:40:32.144 --> 00:40:34.664
That's not their
defense system, Ronan.

00:40:39.049 --> 00:40:40.249
Take her down.

00:41:00.036 --> 00:41:01.076
Whoo!

00:41:50.683 --> 00:41:52.603
Return to the jump point.

00:42:41.761 --> 00:42:43.241
I'm so proud of you.

00:42:45.241 --> 00:42:46.601
You've come a long way

00:42:46.681 --> 00:42:48.641
since I found you
that day by the lake.

00:42:49.201 --> 00:42:51.321
But can you keep
your emotions in check

00:42:51.401 --> 00:42:53.601
long enough to take me on?

00:42:53.981 --> 00:42:56.621
Or will they get the
better of you as always?

00:42:58.001 --> 00:42:59.681
I always told you...

00:42:59.841 --> 00:43:01.121
you'll be ready

00:43:01.201 --> 00:43:03.561
the day you can knock
me down as yourself.

00:43:03.721 --> 00:43:05.161
This is that moment.

00:43:05.321 --> 00:43:07.841
This is that moment, Vers!

00:43:08.001 --> 00:43:09.081
Turn off the light show...

00:43:09.241 --> 00:43:12.601
and prove to me you
can beat me without...

00:43:28.121 --> 00:43:30.121
I have nothing to prove to you.

00:43:45.961 --> 00:43:48.001
<i>Destination: Hala.</i>

00:43:48.161 --> 00:43:49.801
I can't go back empty-handed.

00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:51.721
You won't be empty-handed.

00:43:51.881 --> 00:43:54.161
I'm sending you with a message.

00:43:54.361 --> 00:43:57.521
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

00:43:57.681 --> 00:44:00.441
The war. The lies.
All of it.

00:44:02.321 --> 00:44:03.681
You can't do this.

00:44:22.601 --> 00:44:26.161
That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? Huh?

00:44:27.321 --> 00:44:28.721
Those bad guys still
in there somewhere?

00:44:28.801 --> 00:44:29.881
Ow!

00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:31.201
Mother Flerken!

00:44:31.401 --> 00:44:32.481
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:44:32.921 --> 00:44:34.481
It's just a scratch.

00:44:34.841 --> 00:44:36.121
No.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:45.521
I can't believe

00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:47.001
you got in the
raddest dogfight ever...

00:44:47.121 --> 00:44:48.481
and I missed it.

00:44:48.641 --> 00:44:50.241
I'd say you
arrived just in time.

00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:52.441
Some nifty flying
you did out there.

00:44:52.601 --> 00:44:54.601
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always
use a good pilot like you.

00:44:54.761 --> 00:44:56.481
I'll consider it...

00:44:56.641 --> 00:44:59.641
as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.

00:44:59.841 --> 00:45:01.001
How's your eye?

00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:03.201
Hmm.
Getting better every second.

00:45:03.361 --> 00:45:04.601
Just so I'm clear...

00:45:04.761 --> 00:45:06.121
you were Soh-Larr...

00:45:06.281 --> 00:45:08.321
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
- Keller.

00:45:08.841 --> 00:45:11.161
He tied my boss up,
stole his identity.

00:45:11.321 --> 00:45:14.161
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

00:45:14.361 --> 00:45:15.601
It is a little like stealing.

00:45:15.761 --> 00:45:17.041
Whose side are you on here?

00:45:17.441 --> 00:45:18.881
You're good to go here
until you recover...

00:45:19.041 --> 00:45:22.081
but you and your family
are gonna need a new look.

00:45:22.281 --> 00:45:23.841
I could go back
to being your boss.

00:45:24.001 --> 00:45:25.001
Uh, please don't.

00:45:25.201 --> 00:45:28.041
Come on. I loved sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

00:45:28.201 --> 00:45:30.521
No way.
You guys have the best eyes.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:32.681
Don't ever change your eyes.

00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:34.241
- She has beautiful eyes.
- That's very sweet of you.

00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:36.001
I was trying not to panic...

00:45:36.161 --> 00:45:37.601
I'll help you find a home.

00:45:38.852 --> 00:45:40.012
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

00:45:41.921 --> 00:45:44.081
They can stay here with us.

00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:45.841
Can't they, Mom?

00:45:46.001 --> 00:45:47.921
They won't be safe here, baby.

00:45:48.521 --> 00:45:50.081
Auntie Carol's right.

00:45:50.241 --> 00:45:51.241
They need their own home.

00:45:52.441 --> 00:45:54.241
I'll be back before you know it.

00:45:55.015 --> 00:45:58.001
Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

00:45:58.161 --> 00:46:00.961
Ah, only if you learn to
glow like your Auntie Carol.

00:46:01.121 --> 00:46:02.521
Or maybe I'll build a spaceship.

00:46:02.601 --> 00:46:04.361
- You don't know.
- He doesn't.

00:46:14.121 --> 00:46:16.521
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:18.241
Hidden.

00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:20.441
You sure that's what
Marvel would want?

00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:22.201
Mar-Vell.

00:46:22.361 --> 00:46:23.641
That's what I said.

00:46:23.841 --> 00:46:26.161
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

00:46:26.321 --> 00:46:27.681
Mar-Vell.

00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:28.921
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

00:46:29.001 --> 00:46:30.281
You know, like the Marvelettes.

00:46:33.766 --> 00:46:35.588

00:46:35.661 --> 00:46:38.194

Not ringing any bells?

00:46:45.441 --> 00:46:47.241
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

00:47:02.654 --> 00:47:04.174
I upgraded it.

00:47:04.767 --> 00:47:07.247
Range should be a
couple galaxies, at least.

00:47:10.039 --> 00:47:12.086
What?
You think I'm gonna crank call you?

00:47:12.371 --> 00:47:15.931
For emergencies only, okay?

00:47:21.898 --> 00:47:22.898
Well...

00:47:23.216 --> 00:47:25.496
if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...

00:47:25.781 --> 00:47:27.821
be sure to give
a brother a shout.

00:47:29.841 --> 00:47:31.681
Oh!

00:47:44.401 --> 00:47:46.441
We got the ketchup stain off.

00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:53.681
Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble.

00:47:55.681 --> 00:47:56.881
Hmm.

00:48:03.062 --> 00:48:05.662
It's hard for me to
say goodbye, too.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.440
Go on.

00:49:27.582 --> 00:49:30.302
Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

00:49:35.215 --> 00:49:36.415
So, is it true?

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:38.641
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

00:49:38.841 --> 00:49:41.241
because you refused to
give them the Tesseract?

00:49:42.201 --> 00:49:45.881
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

00:49:46.121 --> 00:49:47.201
Understood.

00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:49.721
I'm sorry to report

00:49:49.841 --> 00:49:50.841
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.

00:49:51.001 --> 00:49:53.201
I'm sure it'll turn
up somewhere.

00:49:54.841 --> 00:49:56.521
I'll let you know when it does.

00:49:56.721 --> 00:49:58.081
Then what?

00:49:58.641 --> 00:49:59.641
Sir?

00:50:00.001 --> 00:50:01.121
We have no idea

00:50:01.201 --> 00:50:04.241
what other intergalactic
threats are out there.

00:50:04.441 --> 00:50:06.441
And our one-woman security force

00:50:06.521 --> 00:50:07.761
had a prior commitment...

00:50:07.921 --> 00:50:09.681
on the other side
of the universe.

00:50:12.521 --> 00:50:14.561
S.H.I.E.L.D.
alone can't protect us.

00:50:16.321 --> 00:50:17.841
We need to find more.

00:50:18.161 --> 00:50:19.161
More weapons?

00:50:19.321 --> 00:50:20.921
More heroes.

00:50:21.201 --> 00:50:22.721
You think you can
find others like her?

00:50:22.801 --> 00:50:25.801
Hmm, we found her, and
we weren't even looking.

00:50:26.921 --> 00:50:28.201
Get some rest, sir.

00:50:29.281 --> 00:50:31.121
You got a big decision to make.

00:51:17.296 --> 00:51:18.155
Hey, what's going on?

00:51:18.273 --> 00:51:19.473
I think we're here.

00:51:19.642 --> 00:51:22.082
I don't think this rig
has a self-park function.

00:51:23.842 --> 00:51:25.402
Get your hand inside
the steering gimbal.

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:26.522
Close those around it.

00:51:28.162 --> 00:51:29.202
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

00:51:29.402 --> 00:51:30.682
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta

00:51:30.762 --> 00:51:32.442
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.

00:51:36.849 --> 00:51:38.089
We might wanna turn.

00:51:38.335 --> 00:51:39.575
Turn! Turn! Turn!

00:52:09.442 --> 00:52:10.922
You all right?

00:52:11.962 --> 00:52:13.682
That was close.

00:52:15.151 --> 00:52:16.431
I owe you one.

00:52:16.802 --> 00:52:18.882
Let me just say, if aliens

00:52:18.962 --> 00:52:20.722
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...

00:52:20.882 --> 00:52:22.042
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

00:52:22.202 --> 00:52:24.522
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

00:52:24.602 --> 00:52:26.202
out of you for the rest of the trip.
You understand?

00:52:26.282 --> 00:52:27.722
I'm trying to say that
something is coming.

00:52:35.076 --> 00:52:36.156
Thanos!

00:52:57.042 --> 00:52:59.042
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Please don't put your eggs in me!

00:53:00.562 --> 00:53:03.042
Stay down, clown.

00:53:08.242 --> 00:53:10.322
Die, blanket of death!

00:53:16.242 --> 00:53:19.162
Everybody stay where you are.
Chill the eff out.

00:53:20.479 --> 00:53:22.479
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

00:53:23.122 --> 00:53:24.362
Where is Gamora?

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.940
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

00:53:27.322 --> 00:53:30.122
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?

00:53:30.322 --> 00:53:32.202
Tell me where the
girl is or I swear to you

00:53:32.322 --> 00:53:33.562
I'm gonna French
fry this little freak.

00:53:33.722 --> 00:53:36.562
Let's do it. You shoot my
guy and I'll blast him. Let's go!

00:53:37.122 --> 00:53:39.722
Do it, Quill!
I can take it.

00:53:39.882 --> 00:53:41.882
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

00:53:42.082 --> 00:53:44.122
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna
tell me where she is? That's fine.

00:53:44.282 --> 00:53:45.322
I'll kill all three of you

00:53:45.402 --> 00:53:47.242
and I'll beat it out
of Thanos myself.

00:53:47.402 --> 00:53:48.402
Starting with you.

00:53:48.482 --> 00:53:49.562
Wait, what, Thanos?

00:53:49.642 --> 00:53:51.722
All right, let me ask
you this one time.

00:53:52.242 --> 00:53:53.922
What master do you serve?

00:53:54.082 --> 00:53:55.322
What master do I serve?

00:53:55.402 --> 00:53:56.882
What am I supposed
to say, "Jesus"?

00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:58.842
You're from Earth.

00:53:58.922 --> 00:53:59.962
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.

00:54:00.042 --> 00:54:01.362
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

00:54:01.522 --> 00:54:02.562
What are you hassling us for?

00:54:02.762 --> 00:54:04.482
So you're not with Thanos?

00:54:05.002 --> 00:54:06.802
With Thanos?

00:54:07.362 --> 00:54:09.962
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

00:54:10.122 --> 00:54:11.962
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

00:54:12.802 --> 00:54:14.522
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.

00:54:14.602 --> 00:54:16.882
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

00:54:17.042 --> 00:54:18.242
You know Thor?

00:54:18.402 --> 00:54:19.482
Yeah.

00:54:19.562 --> 00:54:22.002
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

00:54:25.882 --> 00:54:27.842
The hell happened
to this planet?

00:54:28.042 --> 00:54:29.802
It's eight degrees off its axis.

00:54:29.882 --> 00:54:32.122
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

00:54:33.429 --> 00:54:36.242
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

00:54:37.202 --> 00:54:39.842
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

00:54:40.002 --> 00:54:41.242
Or at least the
beginnings of one.

00:54:41.402 --> 00:54:42.762
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

00:54:42.842 --> 00:54:44.042
pin him down, get what we need.

00:54:44.202 --> 00:54:45.882
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

00:54:45.962 --> 00:54:47.002
We just want the gauntlet.

00:54:47.562 --> 00:54:49.962
Are you yawning?

00:54:50.042 --> 00:54:52.202
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

00:54:52.362 --> 00:54:53.322
Did you hear what I said?

00:54:54.162 --> 00:54:56.442
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

00:54:56.602 --> 00:54:57.682
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

00:54:57.842 --> 00:55:00.682
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

00:55:00.842 --> 00:55:02.362
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

00:55:02.522 --> 00:55:04.082
Kick names, take ass.

00:55:04.282 --> 00:55:05.522
Yeah, that's right.

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:13.562
All right, just get
over here, please.

00:55:14.002 --> 00:55:15.882
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

00:55:16.082 --> 00:55:18.242
"Mr. Lord."
Star-Lord is fine.

00:55:20.962 --> 00:55:22.242
We gotta coalesce.

00:55:22.402 --> 00:55:24.042
'Cause if all we come at
him with is a plucky attitude...

00:55:24.202 --> 00:55:26.482
Dude, don't call us plucky.

00:55:26.682 --> 00:55:27.842
We don't know what it means.

00:55:28.242 --> 00:55:30.842
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan.

00:55:31.002 --> 00:55:33.482
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

00:55:33.642 --> 00:55:35.562
and that way it
might be really good.

00:55:35.722 --> 00:55:37.682
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

00:55:37.842 --> 00:55:39.962
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.

00:55:40.122 --> 00:55:41.162
Like in <i>Footloose,</i> the movie?

00:55:41.362 --> 00:55:42.722
Exactly like <i>Footloose.</i>

00:55:43.242 --> 00:55:44.762
Is it still the greatest
movie in history?

00:55:44.922 --> 00:55:46.042
It never was.

00:55:46.242 --> 00:55:47.282
Don't encourage this, all right?

00:55:47.362 --> 00:55:48.642
- Okay.
- We're getting no help

00:55:48.722 --> 00:55:50.322
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

00:55:50.402 --> 00:55:51.522
By the way, that's a compliment.

00:55:52.122 --> 00:55:53.602
Don't forget, I'm half human.

00:55:53.762 --> 00:55:55.322
So that 50% of
me that's stupid...

00:55:56.522 --> 00:55:57.522
that's 100% you.

00:55:57.682 --> 00:55:58.962
Your math is blowing my mind.

00:55:59.042 --> 00:56:00.322
Excuse me.

00:56:01.322 --> 00:56:04.762
But does your
friend often do that?

00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:08.442
Strange, we all right?

00:56:18.762 --> 00:56:19.802
You're back. You're all right.

00:56:19.882 --> 00:56:21.682
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?

00:56:22.162 --> 00:56:25.842
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

00:56:26.722 --> 00:56:28.282
To see all the possible outcomes

00:56:28.362 --> 00:56:30.202
of the coming conflict.

00:56:30.922 --> 00:56:32.282
How many did you see?

00:56:32.442 --> 00:56:34.682
14,000,605.

00:56:36.362 --> 00:56:37.762
How many did we win?

00:56:42.522 --> 00:56:43.682
One.

00:57:32.647 --> 00:57:36.639
<i>♪ Oh, yes, wait a minute,
