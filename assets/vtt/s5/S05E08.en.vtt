WEBVTT

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:16.132
Okay, hold on,
don't shoot.

00:00:17.212 --> 00:00:18.972
- You see where you're going?
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:20.132
Okay.

00:00:20.292 --> 00:00:22.212
Now, let's worry about
how you get there.

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:24.492
Gotta move your foot here.

00:00:24.972 --> 00:00:26.412
Point your toe this way.

00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:28.332
Your hips here.

00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:29.852
Okay?

00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:32.132
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

00:00:32.212 --> 00:00:33.292
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:34.692
How about now?
Can you see now?

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:36.132
- No.
- How about now?

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:39.372
All right.

00:00:40.052 --> 00:00:41.972
Ready?
Three fingers.

00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:43.852
Nice!

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.012
Nice throw, kiddo.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.252
Here you go.

00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:50.772
Hey, you guys want mayo?
Or mustard?

00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:52.292
Or both?

00:00:52.612 --> 00:00:54.572
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:55.772
Probably your brothers.

00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:57.932
Uh, two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

00:00:58.012 --> 00:00:59.012
Got it!

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:01.012
Nate, mayo or mustard?

00:01:01.732 --> 00:01:02.932
How about ketchup?

00:01:03.372 --> 00:01:05.332
Or ketchup. I got ketchup, too.

00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:06.692
Mind your elbow.

00:01:08.772 --> 00:01:10.732
Good job, hawk-eye.

00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:13.612
Go get your arrow.

00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:16.732
Hey, guys!

00:01:16.932 --> 00:01:19.132
Enough practice. Soup's on!

00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:20.332
All right.

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:21.812
We're coming. We're hungry.

00:01:22.892 --> 00:01:24.412
Lila, let's go.

00:01:27.452 --> 00:01:28.732
Lila?

00:01:31.652 --> 00:01:32.652
Honey?

00:01:36.532 --> 00:01:37.612
Hey, babe?

00:01:47.172 --> 00:01:48.492
Babe?

00:01:50.532 --> 00:01:51.812
Babe?

00:01:53.422 --> 00:01:54.652
Boys!

00:01:56.756 --> 00:01:57.756
Boys!

00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:00.852
Laura!

00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:21.084
What I want you can't give me.

00:04:45.152 --> 00:04:46.312
You shouldn't be here.

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:50.749
Neither should you.

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:58.189
I've got a job to do.

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.429
Is that what
you're calling this?

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.909
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:11.829
We found something.

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.669
A chance, maybe.

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.229
Don't.

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:22.589
Don't what?

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:26.959
Don't give me hope.

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.909
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:55.749
You're drifting left.

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.069
One side there, Lebowski.

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:02.549
Ratchet, how's it going?

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:03.709
It's Rocket.

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.429
Take it easy.
You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:12.949
Time travel suit, not bad.

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:15.909
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:16.989
I'm being very careful.

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:18.589
No, you're being very Hulky.

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:19.669
I'm being careful.

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:21.189
These are Pym
Particles, all right?

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:22.629
And ever since Hank
Pym got snapped

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:23.949
out of existence, this is it.

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:25.789
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.869
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.189
We've got enough for
one round-trip each. That's it.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.389
No do-overs.

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:34.749
Plus two test runs.

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:39.749
One test run.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.669
All right.
I'm not ready for this.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.149
I'm game.

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:48.109
I'll do it.

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:49.909
Clint, now you're gonna feel

00:06:49.989 --> 00:06:51.469
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:52.549
Don't worry about that.

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:53.789
Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:55.589
If we can do this, you know...

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.069
go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

00:06:58.229 --> 00:06:59.389
You know, and...

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:04.509
First of all, that's horrible.

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:05.589
It's Thanos.

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.749
And secondly, time
doesn't work that way.

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:10.069
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

00:07:10.269 --> 00:07:11.629
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:12.949
before Thanos gets them...

00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:15.869
Thanos doesn't have the stones.
Problem solved.

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:17.869
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:18.949
Well, that's what I heard.

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:20.189
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:22.149
<i>Star Trek,
Terminator, Timecop...</i>

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:23.909
<i>- Time After Time.</i>
<i>- Quantum Leap.</i>

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.109
<i>Wrinkle in Time,
Somewhere in Time.</i>

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:26.189
<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>

00:07:26.269 --> 00:07:27.309
<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:28.629
<i>Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.</i>

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:30.909
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:32.909
<i>Die Hard.</i>
No, that's not one.

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:34.109
This is known.

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:35.469
I don't know why
everyone believes that,

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:36.629
but that isn't true.

00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:38.709
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:41.189
that past becomes your future...

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:44.309
and your former present
becomes the past...

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:47.109
which can't now be
changed by your new future.

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:48.509
Exactly.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.949
So <i>Back to the Future</i>
is a bunch of bullshit?

00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:57.829
All right, Clint.

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:01.029
We're going in three, two...

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.189
one.

00:09:14.549 --> 00:09:15.869
Cooper?

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:17.589
Where are my headphones?

00:09:17.669 --> 00:09:18.669
Lila?

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:20.869
- I never had them.
- Lila?

00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:23.669
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:25.549
Lila! Lila!

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:32.069
Yeah, Dad?

00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:36.989
Dad?

00:09:39.469 --> 00:09:40.749
Lila!

00:09:46.709 --> 00:09:49.029
Hey. Hey, look at me.

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:50.309
You okay?

00:09:51.029 --> 00:09:53.069
Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:56.149
It worked.

00:09:57.909 --> 00:09:59.309
It worked.

00:10:02.429 --> 00:10:04.269
Okay, so the how works.

00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:07.989
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:10.589
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

00:10:10.749 --> 00:10:12.429
with at least one of
the six Infinity Stones.

00:10:12.589 --> 00:10:14.109
Or substitute the
word "encounter"...

00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:15.349
for "damn near been killed"

00:10:15.429 --> 00:10:16.869
by one of the six
Infinity Stones.

00:10:17.029 --> 00:10:18.189
Well, I haven't...

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:19.269
but I don't even know

00:10:19.349 --> 00:10:20.709
what the hell you're
all talking about.

00:10:20.869 --> 00:10:23.749
Regardless, we only
have enough Pym Particles

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:25.629
for one round-trip each.

00:10:25.789 --> 00:10:26.989
And these stones have been

00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:28.989
in a lot of different
places throughout history.

00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:30.469
Our history.

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:33.629
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

00:10:33.789 --> 00:10:35.589
Which means we
have to pick our targets.

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:37.309
Correct.

00:10:38.669 --> 00:10:40.269
So, let's start with the Aether.

00:10:40.429 --> 00:10:41.629
Thor, what do you know?

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:48.429
Is he asleep?

00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:51.149
No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

00:10:54.229 --> 00:10:55.909
Uh, where to start? Um...

00:10:57.549 --> 00:11:00.109
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

00:11:00.549 --> 00:11:02.389
Someone called
it a stone before.

00:11:03.589 --> 00:11:07.789
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:09.589
so someone's gonna
need to amend that

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:10.829
and stop saying that.

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:13.829
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

00:11:13.989 --> 00:11:15.869
My grandfather,
many years ago...

00:11:16.029 --> 00:11:19.549
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

00:11:20.149 --> 00:11:22.429
Ooh.
Scary beings.

00:11:22.589 --> 00:11:24.309
So, Jane,
actually...

00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:26.429
Oh, there she is.

00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:30.269
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

00:11:31.429 --> 00:11:34.469
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:37.469
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

00:11:37.909 --> 00:11:39.669
and she became very, very sick.

00:11:39.869 --> 00:11:41.749
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:42.989
which is where I'm from...

00:11:43.149 --> 00:11:45.109
and we had to try and fix her.

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:46.909
We were dating at
the time, you see...

00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:50.469
and I got to introduce
her to my mother...

00:11:51.789 --> 00:11:53.829
who's dead and, um...

00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:56.749
Oh, you know, Jane and I

00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:58.749
aren't even dating
anymore, so...

00:11:59.627 --> 00:12:01.105
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

00:12:01.189 --> 00:12:02.549
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:04.394
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:06.086
The only thing that
is permanent in life

00:12:06.143 --> 00:12:07.543
is impermanence.

00:12:08.319 --> 00:12:10.599
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

00:12:10.681 --> 00:12:12.761
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

00:12:12.827 --> 00:12:15.160
Quill said he stole the
Power Stone from Morag.

00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:18.754
- Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:20.998
Quill was a person.

00:12:21.869 --> 00:12:24.189
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

00:12:24.349 --> 00:12:25.789
Oh, look.

00:12:25.869 --> 00:12:28.549
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:31.791
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:33.079
I'll take you to space.

00:12:34.495 --> 00:12:36.415
Thanos found the
Soul Stone on Vormir.

00:12:36.669 --> 00:12:38.629
What is Vormir?

00:12:38.789 --> 00:12:39.949
A dominion of death...

00:12:40.669 --> 00:12:42.549
at the very center
of celestial existence.

00:12:44.469 --> 00:12:48.469
It's where Thanos
murdered my sister.

00:12:54.869 --> 00:12:55.909
Not it.

00:12:57.537 --> 00:12:59.340
- That Time Stone guy.
- Doctor Strange.

00:12:59.469 --> 00:13:01.269
Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?

00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:03.389
Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:04.949
Nice place in the
Village, though.

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:06.629
Yeah, on Sullivan Street?

00:13:06.789 --> 00:13:07.829
Mm... Bleecker Street.

00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:09.029
Wait, he lived in New York?

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:10.669
No, he lived in Toronto.

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:11.789
Uh, yeah, on
Bleecker and Sullivan.

00:13:11.869 --> 00:13:12.869
Have you been
listening to anything?

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:13.949
Guys.

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:15.709
If you pick the right year,

00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:17.429
there are three
stones in New York.

00:13:19.869 --> 00:13:21.589
Shut the front door.

00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:26.359
All right. We have a plan.

00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:31.229
Six stones, three
teams, one shot.

00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:42.789
<i>Five years ago, we lost.</i>

00:13:44.149 --> 00:13:45.429
<i>All of us.</i>

00:13:47.349 --> 00:13:48.749
<i>We lost friends.</i>

00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:51.109
<i>We lost family.</i>

00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:54.909
<i>We lost a part of ourselves.</i>

00:13:56.349 --> 00:13:58.709
<i>Today, we have a
chance to take it all back.</i>

00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:02.949
<i>You know your teams.
You know your missions.</i>

00:14:03.702 --> 00:14:05.622
<i>Get the stones. Get them back.</i>

00:14:06.369 --> 00:14:07.529
One round-trip each.

00:14:07.704 --> 00:14:08.784
No mistakes...

00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:11.141
no do-overs.

00:14:11.254 --> 00:14:13.134
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:15.229
That doesn't mean we
should know what to expect.

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:17.389
Be careful.

00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:19.309
Look out for each other.

00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:22.549
This is the fight
of our lives...

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.029
and we're gonna win.

00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:28.189
Whatever it takes.

00:14:31.429 --> 00:14:32.909
Good luck.

00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:34.149
He's pretty good at that.

00:14:34.309 --> 00:14:35.509
- Right?
- All right.

00:14:35.669 --> 00:14:36.669
You heard the man.

00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:37.989
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:40.509
Trackers engaged.

00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:43.109
You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:44.629
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:44.789 --> 00:14:46.669
Okay, I'll do my best.

00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:48.629
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

00:14:51.674 --> 00:14:52.754
See ya in a minute.

00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:48.549
All right, we all have
our assignments.

00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:50.949
Two stones uptown,
one stone down.

00:15:51.109 --> 00:15:53.029
Stay low.
Keep an eye on the clock.

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:10.309
Maybe smash a few
things along the way.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.429
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:42.629
I'd be careful going that way.

00:16:42.709 --> 00:16:44.309
We just had the floors waxed.

00:16:49.669 --> 00:16:51.269
Yeah, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

00:16:52.869 --> 00:16:55.749
You're about five
years too early.

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:58.669
Stephen Strange is
currently performing surgery

00:16:58.749 --> 00:17:00.269
about 20 blocks that way.

00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:03.069
What do you want from him?

00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:04.949
That, actually.

00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:07.029
Ah!

00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:09.189
I'm afraid not.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:10.989
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:12.909
You don't want to do this.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.709
Ah, you're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.309
and I don't have
time to debate it.

00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:26.909
Let's start over, shall we?

00:17:38.469 --> 00:17:40.069
For you, Lady Jane.

00:17:40.149 --> 00:17:42.509
Um, so you have
anything with pants?

00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:43.789
Pants?

00:17:43.869 --> 00:17:45.989
Never mind.
These will be fine. Thank you.

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:47.749
- Yes, milady.
- Oh, there's Jane.

00:17:49.389 --> 00:17:50.389
All right.

00:17:51.989 --> 00:17:53.229
Here's the deal, tubby.

00:17:53.389 --> 00:17:54.429
You're gonna charm her,

00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:55.789
and I'm gonna poke
her with this thing...

00:17:55.949 --> 00:17:58.389
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:01.269
I'll be right back, okay?

00:18:01.349 --> 00:18:03.109
The wine cellar
is just down here.

00:18:03.269 --> 00:18:06.149
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:07.709
I'll see if the scullery has
a couple of to-go cups.

00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:09.629
Hey. Hey!
Aren't you drunk enough already?

00:18:16.989 --> 00:18:17.989
If you could send
Loki some soup.

00:18:18.069 --> 00:18:19.069
Yes, milady.

00:18:19.189 --> 00:18:20.189
And ask our librarians

00:18:20.269 --> 00:18:23.109
to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.

00:18:29.269 --> 00:18:30.789
Who's the fancy broad?

00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:33.629
That's my mother.

00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:35.869
She dies today.

00:18:36.509 --> 00:18:38.309
Oh, that is today?

00:18:44.869 --> 00:18:47.389
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

00:18:47.989 --> 00:18:49.549
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

00:18:49.709 --> 00:18:50.829
It's a bad idea!

00:18:51.109 --> 00:18:52.149
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

00:18:52.309 --> 00:18:54.749
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:55.829
Come here. Right here.

00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:56.909
I shouldn't be here.
This is bad.

00:18:57.709 --> 00:18:59.429
You think you're the
only one who lost people?

00:18:59.509 --> 00:19:01.349
What do you think
we're doing here?

00:19:01.509 --> 00:19:03.669
I lost the only
family I ever had.

00:19:03.829 --> 00:19:06.269
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

00:19:06.429 --> 00:19:07.829
all gone.

00:19:08.439 --> 00:19:09.799
I get you miss your mom...

00:19:10.189 --> 00:19:11.389
but she's gone.

00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:12.549
Really gone.

00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:15.989
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:17.269
and you can help them.

00:19:18.389 --> 00:19:19.909
So, is it too much to ask

00:19:19.989 --> 00:19:21.589
that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...

00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:24.069
make schmoopy
talk to Pretty Pants...

00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:27.389
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

00:19:27.589 --> 00:19:29.149
and help me get my family back?

00:19:30.349 --> 00:19:31.829
Okay.

00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:33.109
Are you crying?

00:19:33.749 --> 00:19:35.029
No.

00:19:36.869 --> 00:19:38.029
Yes.

00:19:38.229 --> 00:19:39.429
I feel like I'm losing it.

00:19:39.589 --> 00:19:40.589
Get it together!

00:19:40.749 --> 00:19:42.589
You can do this.

00:19:42.829 --> 00:19:44.269
You can do this.

00:19:47.429 --> 00:19:48.429
All right?

00:19:48.589 --> 00:19:49.589
Yes, I can.

00:19:49.749 --> 00:19:50.749
Good.

00:19:52.989 --> 00:19:55.309
I can do this. I can do this.

00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:57.589
I can't do this.

00:19:57.749 --> 00:19:59.629
All right, heartbreaker,
she's alone.

00:19:59.749 --> 00:20:01.189
This is our shot.

00:20:01.349 --> 00:20:03.949
Thor? Thor!

00:20:14.229 --> 00:20:15.589
All right, bring it down, Blue.

00:20:15.749 --> 00:20:18.149
Right on that line.
That's it. Down, down.

00:20:23.179 --> 00:20:24.509
Hey, can we hurry it up?

00:20:24.567 --> 00:20:26.647
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

00:20:26.736 --> 00:20:28.496
All that is really helpful.

00:20:30.869 --> 00:20:32.389
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:35.029
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:37.229
- Hey.
- We got this.

00:20:37.389 --> 00:20:38.589
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:40.069
I'll see you back.

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:42.109
You guys watch each other's six.

00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:44.029
Yeah.

00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:54.229
Coordinates for
Vormir are laid in.

00:20:55.814 --> 00:20:57.734
All they have to
do is not fall out.

00:21:03.709 --> 00:21:06.069
We're a long way from Budapest.

00:21:10.949 --> 00:21:12.469
Okay, so, uh...

00:21:13.709 --> 00:21:16.949
we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.949
and then he leads us to
the Power Stone, is that it?

00:21:19.949 --> 00:21:21.349
Let's take cover.

00:21:22.476 --> 00:21:25.429
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

00:21:25.509 --> 00:21:26.949
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about right now?

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:28.349
Who else is looking
for these stones?

00:21:31.989 --> 00:21:33.389
My father...

00:21:33.589 --> 00:21:35.349
my sister...

00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:36.669
and me.

00:21:36.829 --> 00:21:37.989
And you?

00:21:39.774 --> 00:21:41.374
Where are you right now?

00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:11.309
You're welcome.

00:22:11.469 --> 00:22:13.789
I didn't ask for your help.

00:22:14.212 --> 00:22:16.005
And yet, you always need it.

00:22:20.109 --> 00:22:22.109
Get up.
Father wants us back on the ship.

00:22:22.309 --> 00:22:23.269
Why?

00:22:23.469 --> 00:22:25.469
He's found an Infinity Stone.

00:22:29.949 --> 00:22:31.429
Where?

00:22:31.589 --> 00:22:33.349
On a planet called Morag.

00:22:34.949 --> 00:22:36.869
Father's plan is
finally in motion.

00:22:37.069 --> 00:22:39.069
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

00:22:39.229 --> 00:22:40.429
It's a start.

00:22:40.589 --> 00:22:42.389
If he gets all of them...

00:22:55.229 --> 00:22:57.149
Ronan's located the Power Stone.

00:22:57.229 --> 00:22:58.949
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

00:22:59.109 --> 00:23:00.309
He won't like that.

00:23:00.509 --> 00:23:02.629
His alternative is death.

00:23:04.109 --> 00:23:05.869
Ronan's obsession...

00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:09.069
clouds his judgment.

00:23:13.509 --> 00:23:15.309
We will not fail you, Father.

00:23:16.349 --> 00:23:17.989
No, you won't.

00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:21.669
I swear...

00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:25.469
I will make you proud.

00:23:33.869 --> 00:23:37.509
<i>...we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...</i>

00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:39.709
<i>and then he leads us to
the Power Stone, is that it?</i>

00:23:39.869 --> 00:23:41.429
<i>Let's take cover.</i>

00:23:42.469 --> 00:23:45.349
<i>We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.</i>

00:23:47.749 --> 00:23:49.189
Who was that?

00:23:49.389 --> 00:23:50.469
I don't know.

00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:52.709
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

00:23:54.189 --> 00:23:57.149
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:59.149
Shh.

00:24:07.389 --> 00:24:09.429
Bring her to my ship.

00:24:17.369 --> 00:24:18.088
Better hustle, Cap.

00:24:18.138 --> 00:24:19.932
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

00:24:19.978 --> 00:24:21.698
<i>Got it.
I'm approaching the elevator now.</i>

00:24:28.429 --> 00:24:29.989
If it's all the same to you...

00:24:32.309 --> 00:24:33.829
I'll have that drink now.

00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:35.829
All right, get him on his feet.

00:24:35.989 --> 00:24:39.029
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

00:24:39.189 --> 00:24:40.509
By the way,
feel free to clean up.

00:24:40.829 --> 00:24:43.669
Mr. Rogers, I almost
forgot that that suit...

00:24:43.829 --> 00:24:45.549
did nothing for your ass.

00:24:45.629 --> 00:24:47.029
<i>No one asked you to look, Tony.</i>

00:24:47.109 --> 00:24:48.109
It's ridiculous.

00:24:48.189 --> 00:24:49.309
<i>I think you look great, Cap.</i>

00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:51.829
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.</i>

00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:53.869
Who gets the, uh, magic wand?

00:24:53.949 --> 00:24:55.149
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's

00:24:55.229 --> 00:24:56.389
coming to secure it.

00:25:06.214 --> 00:25:07.974
We can take that off your hands.

00:25:08.229 --> 00:25:09.229
By all means.

00:25:11.338 --> 00:25:13.189
Careful with that thing.

00:25:13.389 --> 00:25:14.829
Yeah, unless you
want your mind erased.

00:25:14.989 --> 00:25:15.989
And not in a fun way.

00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:17.109
We promise to be careful.

00:25:17.229 --> 00:25:18.349
<i>Who are these guys?</i>

00:25:18.509 --> 00:25:19.789
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:25:19.949 --> 00:25:23.069
Well, actually Hydra, but
we didn't know that yet.

00:25:23.229 --> 00:25:25.389
<i>Seriously? You didn't?</i>

00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:27.069
<i>I mean, they look like bad guys.</i>

00:25:27.229 --> 00:25:28.629
You're small, but
you're talking loud.

00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:30.629
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue.

00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:32.789
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue.

00:25:32.949 --> 00:25:35.389
I mean, honestly, how do
you keep your food down?

00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:36.989
Shut up.

00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:38.869
Ooh.
All right, you're up, little buddy.

00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:41.149
There's our stone.

00:25:41.309 --> 00:25:42.309
<i>All right.</i>

00:25:42.469 --> 00:25:43.669
<i>Flick me.</i>

00:25:57.749 --> 00:25:58.829
- Move.
- Hey.

00:25:58.909 --> 00:26:00.669
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey. Buddy!

00:26:00.829 --> 00:26:02.629
What do you think?
Maximum occupancy has been reached.

00:26:02.709 --> 00:26:03.789
Take the stairs.

00:26:03.989 --> 00:26:05.549
Yeah. Stop, stop.

00:26:08.589 --> 00:26:11.989
"Take the stairs."
Hate the stairs.

00:26:15.109 --> 00:26:17.469
All right, Cap, I got our
scepter in the elevator...

00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:19.429
just passing the 80th floor.

00:26:20.229 --> 00:26:21.229
On it.

00:26:21.829 --> 00:26:22.829
Head to the lobby.

00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:23.949
<i> All right, I'll see you there.</i>

00:26:24.309 --> 00:26:25.909
Evidence secure.

00:26:26.069 --> 00:26:27.509
We're en route to Doctor List.

00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:31.069
No.
No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.

00:26:36.229 --> 00:26:37.269
Captain.

00:26:37.349 --> 00:26:38.469
I thought you were coordinating

00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:39.549
search and rescue.

00:26:39.629 --> 00:26:41.189
Change of plans.

00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:46.429
Hey, Cap.

00:26:47.709 --> 00:26:48.749
Rumlow.

00:26:55.069 --> 00:26:56.909
I just got a call
from the secretary.

00:26:57.069 --> 00:26:58.949
I'm gonna be running
point on the scepter.

00:27:01.429 --> 00:27:03.709
Sir? I don't understand.

00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:07.989
We got word there may
be an attempt to steal it.

00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:09.749
Sorry, Cap.

00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:11.349
We can't give you the scepter.

00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:13.789
I'm gonna have
to call the director.

00:27:13.949 --> 00:27:16.069
That's okay. Trust me.

00:27:19.589 --> 00:27:20.589
Hail Hydra.

00:27:35.309 --> 00:27:37.189
So many stairs!

00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:51.549
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

00:27:51.709 --> 00:27:52.789
It is go time.

00:27:52.869 --> 00:27:53.949
<i>Bombs away.</i>

00:28:01.189 --> 00:28:03.589
<i>Is that Axe Body Spray?</i>

00:28:03.749 --> 00:28:06.069
Yeah, I had a can in the
desk for emergencies. Relax.

00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:07.229
Can we focus, please?

00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:08.629
<i>I'm going inside you...</i>

00:28:09.349 --> 00:28:10.349
<i>now.</i>

00:28:15.885 --> 00:28:17.525
Uh, may I ask you
where you're going?

00:28:17.627 --> 00:28:20.189
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:21.349
Alexander Pierce.

00:28:21.429 --> 00:28:22.749
He's the man above the folks

00:28:22.829 --> 00:28:23.989
- behind Nick Fury.
- Oh.

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:25.269
My friends call me
Mr. Secretary.

00:28:25.349 --> 00:28:26.349
I'm gonna have to ask you

00:28:26.429 --> 00:28:27.749
to turn that
prisoner over to me.

00:28:27.829 --> 00:28:29.709
Uh, Loki will be
answering to Odin himself.

00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:30.869
No, he's going to answer to us.

00:28:30.949 --> 00:28:32.229
Odin can have what's left.

00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:33.869
And I'm gonna need that case.

00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:35.829
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D.
property for over 70 years.

00:28:35.989 --> 00:28:36.989
Hand over the case, Stark.

00:28:37.069 --> 00:28:38.549
All right, move it,
Stuart Little.

00:28:38.629 --> 00:28:39.829
Things are getting dicey out here.
Let's go.

00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:41.629
I'm not gonna argue who's
got the higher authority here...

00:28:42.069 --> 00:28:43.389
<i>You promise me you won't die?</i>

00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:46.269
We're only giving me a
mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

00:28:46.429 --> 00:28:47.989
<i>That doesn't sound mild.</i>

00:28:48.189 --> 00:28:49.189
I need the case.

00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:50.629
I know you got a lot
of pull, I'm just saying,

00:28:50.709 --> 00:28:52.069
- jurisdiction...
- Okay, then give me the case.

00:28:52.229 --> 00:28:53.229
Well, jurisdiction...

00:28:53.309 --> 00:28:54.309
Hand it over.

00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:55.389
Do it, Lang!

00:28:55.469 --> 00:28:56.469
Get your hands off me.

00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:58.029
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

00:28:58.469 --> 00:28:59.749
<i>Here goes!</i>

00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:04.109
- Stark?
- Stark?

00:29:05.429 --> 00:29:06.629
He's convulsing. Give him air!

00:29:06.709 --> 00:29:08.389
- Medic!
- Medic!

00:29:08.949 --> 00:29:10.309
Give these guys some help.

00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:12.069
Speak to me.

00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:13.949
Stark, is it your chest machine?

00:29:16.709 --> 00:29:18.029
Breathe, breathe.

00:29:23.309 --> 00:29:24.549
Good job. Meet me in the alley.

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:25.629
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

00:29:31.349 --> 00:29:33.069
No stairs!

00:29:40.189 --> 00:29:42.549
Uh...
Come on, Stark, stay with us.

00:29:42.629 --> 00:29:43.629
I'm going to try something.
Okay?

00:29:43.749 --> 00:29:44.869
I have no idea if
it's going to work.

00:29:46.916 --> 00:29:47.709
Yes!

00:29:47.869 --> 00:29:49.229
Oh, that worked a treat.

00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:50.389
Dude, that was so crazy.

00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:51.949
I had no idea if that
was gonna work.

00:29:52.109 --> 00:29:53.989
- The case.
- The case is, uh...

00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:56.149
Where's the case?
Where's Loki?

00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:58.149
Loki!

00:29:58.229 --> 00:29:59.709
<i>That wasn't supposed
to happen, was it?</i>

00:29:59.789 --> 00:30:00.869
Oh, we blew it.

00:30:00.949 --> 00:30:02.469
Loki?

00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:05.789
Tony, what's going on?

00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:08.469
Tell me you found that Cube.

00:30:11.349 --> 00:30:12.749
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

00:30:16.829 --> 00:30:19.069
I have eyes on Loki.
14th floor.

00:30:19.229 --> 00:30:20.589
I'm not Loki...

00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:25.829
and I don't wanna hurt you.

00:30:34.749 --> 00:30:35.749
I can do this all day.

00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:37.189
Yeah, I know.

00:30:37.349 --> 00:30:38.389
I know.

00:31:11.109 --> 00:31:12.109
Where did you get this?

00:31:23.342 --> 00:31:26.382
Bucky is alive.

00:31:29.902 --> 00:31:30.942
What?

00:31:45.855 --> 00:31:47.375
That is America's ass.

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:52.989
Please, please.

00:31:53.069 --> 00:31:54.949
I'm sorry, I can't
help you, Bruce.

00:31:55.989 --> 00:31:57.309
If I give up the Time Stone

00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:59.109
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

00:31:59.269 --> 00:32:01.029
With all due
respect, all right...

00:32:01.189 --> 00:32:04.269
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.790
The Infinity Stones create

00:32:11.949 --> 00:32:14.229
what you experience
as the flow of time.

00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:15.909
Remove one of the stones...

00:32:16.069 --> 00:32:18.189
and that flow splits.

00:32:18.349 --> 00:32:20.789
Now, this may
benefit your reality...

00:32:20.949 --> 00:32:23.109
but my new one,
not so much.

00:32:23.469 --> 00:32:25.189
In this new branch reality...

00:32:25.349 --> 00:32:27.029
without our chief weapon

00:32:27.109 --> 00:32:28.429
against the forces
of darkness...

00:32:28.868 --> 00:32:30.789
our world would be overrun.

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.629
Millions will suffer.

00:32:32.829 --> 00:32:34.069
So, tell me, Doctor.

00:32:34.532 --> 00:32:36.829
Can your science
prevent all that?

00:32:36.989 --> 00:32:37.989
No...

00:32:38.989 --> 00:32:40.109
but we can erase it.

00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:41.989
Because once we're
done with the stones...

00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:44.309
we can return each
one to its own timeline...

00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:45.989
at the moment it was taken.

00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:48.629
So, chronologically...

00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:50.709
in that reality...

00:32:53.309 --> 00:32:54.949
it never left.

00:32:57.349 --> 00:33:00.429
Yes, but you're leaving
out the most important part.

00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:06.469
In order to return the
stones, you have to survive.

00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:09.229
We will. I will. I promise.

00:33:10.045 --> 00:33:12.085
I can't risk this
reality on a promise.

00:33:13.305 --> 00:33:16.509
It's the duty of the
Sorcerer Supreme

00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:18.389
to protect the Time Stone.

00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:20.669
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?

00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:23.709
What did you say?

00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:26.189
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

00:33:26.829 --> 00:33:28.429
- Willingly?
- Yes.

00:33:32.349 --> 00:33:33.989
- Why?
- I have no idea.

00:33:34.069 --> 00:33:35.829
Maybe he made a mistake.

00:33:45.989 --> 00:33:47.269
Or I did.

00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:09.949
Strange is meant
to be the best of us.

00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:12.629
So, he must've
done it for a reason.

00:34:13.514 --> 00:34:15.114
I fear you might be right.

00:34:20.229 --> 00:34:21.229
Thank you.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:29.149
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

00:34:31.189 --> 00:34:32.389
We all are.

00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:54.429
Run diagnostics.

00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:57.109
Show me her memory file.

00:34:58.709 --> 00:35:01.189
Sire, the file
appears entangled.

00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:04.309
It was a memory, but not hers.

00:35:05.549 --> 00:35:06.949
There's another consciousness...

00:35:07.149 --> 00:35:08.429
sharing her network.

00:35:08.934 --> 00:35:10.254
Another Nebula.

00:35:12.429 --> 00:35:13.909
Impossible.

00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:16.709
This duplicate
carries a time stamp...

00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:19.789
from nine years in the future.

00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:26.869
Where is this other Nebula?

00:35:27.549 --> 00:35:29.549
In our solar system on Morag.

00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:32.389
Can you access her?

00:35:32.549 --> 00:35:34.589
Yes, the two are linked.

00:35:34.749 --> 00:35:36.829
Search the
duplicate's memories...

00:35:36.989 --> 00:35:39.189
for Infinity Stones.

00:35:42.749 --> 00:35:43.909
<i>And these stones have been</i>

00:35:43.989 --> 00:35:45.709
<i>in a lot of different
places throughout history.</i>

00:35:45.869 --> 00:35:46.949
<i>Our history.</i>

00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:49.189
<i>So, not a lot of
convenient spots</i>

00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:50.469
<i>to just drop in.</i>

00:35:50.629 --> 00:35:52.309
<i>Which means we
have to pick our targets.</i>

00:35:52.469 --> 00:35:53.749
<i>- Correct.</i>
- Freeze image.

00:35:55.709 --> 00:35:56.949
Terrans.

00:35:58.029 --> 00:35:59.669
Avengers.

00:36:00.789 --> 00:36:02.469
Unruly wretches.

00:36:02.629 --> 00:36:04.149
What's that reflection?

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:06.949
Amplify this, Maw.

00:36:10.469 --> 00:36:11.669
I don't understand.

00:36:16.389 --> 00:36:17.949
Two Nebulas.

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:20.549
No.
The same Nebula...

00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:23.109
from two different times.

00:36:24.389 --> 00:36:25.989
Set course for Morag.

00:36:26.189 --> 00:36:28.549
And scan the
duplicate's memories.

00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:31.669
I wanna see everything.

00:36:41.549 --> 00:36:43.509
My ladies, I'll see you after.

00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:45.029
I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

00:36:59.429 --> 00:37:00.429
What are you doing?

00:37:01.749 --> 00:37:03.269
Oh, God!

00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:05.869
You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.

00:37:05.989 --> 00:37:07.869
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:09.389
What are you wearing?

00:37:09.549 --> 00:37:11.909
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

00:37:14.751 --> 00:37:15.831
Mm...

00:37:16.029 --> 00:37:17.389
What's wrong with your eye?

00:37:17.549 --> 00:37:18.549
Oh, my eye.

00:37:18.709 --> 00:37:20.669
Remember the, uh,
Battle of Harokin...

00:37:20.869 --> 00:37:22.109
when I got hit in the face

00:37:22.189 --> 00:37:23.949
with the broadsword?

00:37:27.429 --> 00:37:29.509
You're not the Thor
I know at all, are you?

00:37:30.229 --> 00:37:31.989
Yes, I am.

00:37:32.469 --> 00:37:34.989
The future hasn't
been kind to you, has it?

00:37:35.469 --> 00:37:37.349
I didn't say I was
from the future.

00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:40.389
I was raised by witches, boy.

00:37:41.429 --> 00:37:43.789
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

00:37:45.869 --> 00:37:48.149
Yeah, I'm totally
from the future.

00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:49.909
Yes, you are, honey.

00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:51.589
I really need to talk to you.

00:37:51.749 --> 00:37:52.749
We can talk.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.150
His head was over there...

00:38:19.509 --> 00:38:21.989
and his body over there...

00:38:22.979 --> 00:38:25.779
I mean, what was the point?
I was too late.

00:38:26.469 --> 00:38:28.069
I was just standing there.

00:38:29.029 --> 00:38:30.789
Some idiot with an axe.

00:38:30.949 --> 00:38:32.669
Now, you're no idiot.

00:38:33.663 --> 00:38:35.263
You're here, aren't you?

00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:38.069
Seeking counsel from the
wisest person in Asgard.

00:38:38.389 --> 00:38:39.429
I am. Yes.

00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:40.949
Idiot, no.

00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:42.589
A failure?

00:38:42.789 --> 00:38:43.909
Absolutely.

00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:45.869
That's a little bit harsh.

00:38:46.029 --> 00:38:47.509
Do you know what that makes you?

00:38:48.749 --> 00:38:50.749
Just like everyone else.

00:38:50.909 --> 00:38:52.989
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:54.189
Mm.

00:38:54.269 --> 00:38:57.429
Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.

00:38:58.149 --> 00:39:01.189
The measure of a person,
of a hero...

00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:04.749
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

00:39:09.989 --> 00:39:11.469
I've really missed you, Mom.

00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:19.109
Thor!
I got it!

00:39:19.989 --> 00:39:21.509
Get that rabbit!

00:39:24.509 --> 00:39:26.109
Mom, I have to
tell you something.

00:39:26.269 --> 00:39:28.069
No, son, you don't.

00:39:28.229 --> 00:39:30.749
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

00:39:30.909 --> 00:39:32.549
This is about your future.

00:39:32.669 --> 00:39:34.069
Uh, it's none of my business.

00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:39.309
Hi.

00:39:39.509 --> 00:39:41.509
You must be Mom.

00:39:41.669 --> 00:39:43.109
I got the thing. Come on.
We gotta move.

00:39:43.269 --> 00:39:44.749
Oh, I wish we had more time.

00:39:44.909 --> 00:39:46.749
No, this was a gift.

00:39:46.909 --> 00:39:50.349
Now you go and be the
man you're meant to be.

00:39:50.789 --> 00:39:52.949
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

00:39:57.429 --> 00:39:59.349
And eat a salad.

00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:01.469
Come on, we gotta go.

00:40:01.629 --> 00:40:03.229
- Goodbye.
- Three...

00:40:03.389 --> 00:40:04.469
- Two...
- No, wait!

00:40:07.749 --> 00:40:08.949
What am I looking at?

00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:10.549
Oh, sometimes it takes a second.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.069
I'm still worthy.

00:40:23.509 --> 00:40:25.109
Oh, boy.

00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:28.229
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

00:41:07.469 --> 00:41:09.069
So, he's an idiot?

00:41:10.429 --> 00:41:11.829
Yeah.

00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:21.549
What's that?

00:41:21.709 --> 00:41:23.589
The tool of a thief.

00:41:31.147 --> 00:41:32.227
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:41:33.262 --> 00:41:34.902
This is the part where
spikes come out...

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:36.550
with skeletons on the end
of them and everything.

00:41:36.749 --> 00:41:37.949
What are you talking about?

00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:39.149
When you break
into a place called

00:41:39.229 --> 00:41:40.429
"The Temple of
the Power Stone"...

00:41:40.629 --> 00:41:41.909
there's gonna be a
bunch of booby traps.

00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:44.309
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. All right. Go ahead.

00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:19.109
I wasn't always like this.

00:42:20.029 --> 00:42:21.029
Me either.

00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:24.269
But we work with
what we got, right?

00:42:25.989 --> 00:42:27.069
Hmm.

00:42:28.029 --> 00:42:29.709
Let's sync up.

00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:34.029
Three, two, one.

00:42:46.869 --> 00:42:48.509
<i>You murdered trillions!</i>

00:42:48.669 --> 00:42:49.989
<i>You should be grateful.</i>

00:42:51.709 --> 00:42:53.309
<i>Where are the stones?</i>

00:42:53.469 --> 00:42:54.469
<i>Gone.</i>

00:42:55.229 --> 00:42:56.229
<i>Reduced to atoms.</i>

00:42:56.949 --> 00:42:58.629
<i> You used them two days ago!</i>

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:01.909
<i>I used the stones
to destroy the stones.</i>

00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:03.909
<i>It nearly killed me.</i>

00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:05.989
<i>But the work is done.</i>

00:43:06.149 --> 00:43:07.989
<i>It always will be.</i>

00:43:09.269 --> 00:43:12.749
<i>I am inevitable.</i>

00:43:13.989 --> 00:43:16.029
What did you do to them?

00:43:16.229 --> 00:43:17.469
Nothing.

00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:19.629
Yet.

00:43:21.429 --> 00:43:23.349
They're not trying
to stop something

00:43:23.429 --> 00:43:25.149
I'm going to do in our time.

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:27.469
They're trying to undo something

00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:29.109
I've already done in theirs.

00:43:29.269 --> 00:43:30.949
The stones.

00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:33.749
I found them all.

00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:36.949
I won.

00:43:37.669 --> 00:43:40.629
Tipped the cosmic
scales to balance.

00:43:44.669 --> 00:43:46.389
This is your future.

00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:48.789
It's my destiny.

00:43:49.989 --> 00:43:52.029
<i>My father is many things.</i>

00:43:52.189 --> 00:43:54.029
<i>A liar is not one of them.</i>

00:43:55.709 --> 00:43:56.709
<i>Ah.</i>

00:43:57.749 --> 00:43:59.669
<i>Thank you, daughter.</i>

00:43:59.829 --> 00:44:01.989
<i>Perhaps I treated
you too harshly.</i>

00:44:06.509 --> 00:44:09.389
And that is destiny fulfilled.

00:44:09.789 --> 00:44:11.189
Sire...

00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:12.469
your daughter...

00:44:14.949 --> 00:44:15.949
No!

00:44:16.389 --> 00:44:17.429
...is a traitor.

00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:20.069
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

00:44:20.229 --> 00:44:21.389
I would never betray you.

00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:23.389
Never. Never.

00:44:29.149 --> 00:44:30.309
I know.

00:44:31.269 --> 00:44:34.549
And you'll have the
chance to prove it.

00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:41.909
No!

00:44:42.629 --> 00:44:43.829
He knows!

00:44:48.429 --> 00:44:50.469
Barton!
Barton, come in.

00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:52.389
Romanoff!

00:44:53.029 --> 00:44:54.429
Come in, we have a problem.

00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:55.709
Come on!

00:44:55.909 --> 00:44:57.309
Come in, we have a...

00:44:57.469 --> 00:44:58.829
Thanos knows.

00:44:59.469 --> 00:45:00.709
Thanos...

00:45:14.469 --> 00:45:15.549
Cap.

00:45:17.149 --> 00:45:19.429
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem.

00:45:20.139 --> 00:45:21.589
Yeah, we do.

00:45:22.149 --> 00:45:23.269
Well, what are we gonna do now?

00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:24.429
You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.

00:45:24.509 --> 00:45:25.869
I just got hit in the
head with the Hulk.

00:45:25.949 --> 00:45:27.509
You said that we had one shot.

00:45:27.669 --> 00:45:29.029
This was our shot.

00:45:29.189 --> 00:45:31.189
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:32.789
- It was six stones or nothing.
- You're repeating yourself,

00:45:32.869 --> 00:45:33.909
you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:35.709
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

00:45:35.789 --> 00:45:36.789
Dude. Come on!

00:45:36.909 --> 00:45:37.909
No.
You never wanted a time heist.

00:45:37.989 --> 00:45:38.989
You weren't on board
with the time heist.

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:40.269
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:41.749
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah.

00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:43.589
Are there any other
options with the Tesseract?

00:45:43.789 --> 00:45:44.989
No, no, no, there's
no other options.

00:45:45.149 --> 00:45:46.389
There's no do-overs.

00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:48.629
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

00:45:48.709 --> 00:45:49.709
Each.

00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:52.109
That's it. All right?
We use that...

00:45:52.269 --> 00:45:53.429
bye-bye, you're not going home.

00:45:53.629 --> 00:45:55.589
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

00:45:55.749 --> 00:45:56.909
then no one else is
going home, either.

00:45:57.451 --> 00:45:58.451
I got it.

00:45:59.269 --> 00:46:01.549
There's another way
to retake the Tesseract

00:46:01.629 --> 00:46:03.349
and acquire new particles.

00:46:04.149 --> 00:46:05.229
Little stroll down memory lane.

00:46:05.989 --> 00:46:07.829
Military installation,
Garden State.

00:46:11.909 --> 00:46:13.229
When were they both there?

00:46:13.389 --> 00:46:15.749
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

00:46:16.429 --> 00:46:17.429
- How vague?
- What are you

00:46:17.509 --> 00:46:18.549
talking about?
Where are we going?

00:46:18.629 --> 00:46:19.629
I know for a fact
they were there.

00:46:19.709 --> 00:46:20.709
Who's they?
What are we doing?

00:46:20.789 --> 00:46:21.909
And I know how I know.

00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:25.349
Guys, what is it?

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:27.549
Looks like we're improvising.

00:46:27.749 --> 00:46:28.949
- Great.
- What are we improvising?

00:46:29.029 --> 00:46:30.789
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

00:46:30.949 --> 00:46:31.949
Suit up.

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:33.629
- What's in New Jersey?
- 0-4.

00:46:33.709 --> 00:46:34.709
0-4.

00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:35.909
- Uh, 0-7.
- 0-7.

00:46:35.989 --> 00:46:37.869
- Excuse me.
- 1-9-7-0.

00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:39.349
Are you sure?

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:40.709
Cap?
Captain?

00:46:40.869 --> 00:46:42.709
Steve? Sorry.

00:46:42.869 --> 00:46:44.509
America. Rogers.

00:46:44.669 --> 00:46:45.869
Look, if you do this...

00:46:46.149 --> 00:46:48.709
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

00:46:49.789 --> 00:46:51.589
Thanks for the
pep talk, pissant.

00:46:52.629 --> 00:46:53.829
You trust me?

00:46:54.709 --> 00:46:55.869
I do.

00:46:56.949 --> 00:46:58.269
Your call.

00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:00.869
Here we go.

00:47:16.909 --> 00:47:20.549
Hey, man!
Make love, not war.

00:47:26.469 --> 00:47:29.109
Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?

00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:30.789
The idea of me was.

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:33.509
Right. Well,
imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:47:33.669 --> 00:47:36.949
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

00:47:38.269 --> 00:47:39.829
where do you hide it?

00:47:40.029 --> 00:47:41.669
In plain sight.

00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:11.229
Good luck on your
mission, Captain.

00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:13.909
Good luck on your
project, Doctor.

00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:18.429
You new here?

00:48:20.989 --> 00:48:22.309
Not exactly.

00:48:29.029 --> 00:48:30.829
Come on, you bastard.

00:48:37.629 --> 00:48:39.109
Gotcha.

00:48:43.989 --> 00:48:44.989
Whew.

00:48:56.629 --> 00:48:58.309
Back in the game.

00:49:00.949 --> 00:49:02.189
Arnim, you in there?

00:49:03.149 --> 00:49:04.189
Arnim?

00:49:09.469 --> 00:49:10.829
Hey!

00:49:11.375 --> 00:49:13.095
The door is this way, pal.

00:49:14.029 --> 00:49:15.069
Oh, yeah.

00:49:15.229 --> 00:49:17.109
Looking for Doctor
Zola, have you seen him?

00:49:17.269 --> 00:49:20.709
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

00:49:22.189 --> 00:49:23.549
Pardon me.

00:49:24.269 --> 00:49:25.909
Do I know you?

00:49:27.149 --> 00:49:28.149
No, sir. Uh...

00:49:29.629 --> 00:49:31.429
I'm a visitor from MIT.

00:49:31.989 --> 00:49:33.109
Oh. MIT.

00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:34.709
Got a name?

00:49:35.189 --> 00:49:36.309
Howard.

00:49:36.469 --> 00:49:38.949
- That'll be easy to remember.
- Howard...

00:49:39.989 --> 00:49:40.949
Potts.

00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:43.749
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

00:49:43.909 --> 00:49:44.949
Hi.

00:49:45.029 --> 00:49:46.309
Shake that, don't pull it.

00:49:46.469 --> 00:49:47.469
Yeah.

00:49:48.909 --> 00:49:51.109
You look a little green
around the gills, there, Potts.

00:49:51.269 --> 00:49:53.429
I'm fine. Just long hours.

00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:55.309
You wanna get some air?

00:49:57.869 --> 00:49:59.669
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah.

00:49:59.829 --> 00:50:01.069
- That'd be swell.
- That way.

00:50:01.229 --> 00:50:02.229
Okay.

00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:04.029
Need your briefcase?

00:50:08.389 --> 00:50:10.949
You're not one of those
beatniks, are you, Potts?

00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:18.589
- Hello?
<i>- Doctor Pym?</i>

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:20.949
That would be the
number that you called, yes.

00:50:21.149 --> 00:50:23.389
<i>This is Captain
Stevens from shipping.</i>

00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:24.669
<i>We have a package for you.</i>

00:50:24.749 --> 00:50:26.229
Oh, bring it up.

00:50:26.389 --> 00:50:28.349
<i>That's the thing, sir, we can't.</i>

00:50:29.469 --> 00:50:32.109
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

00:50:32.269 --> 00:50:33.629
<i>Well, it's just...</i>

00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:35.269
<i>Sir, the box is glowing...</i>

00:50:35.429 --> 00:50:36.429
<i>and to be honest,</i>

00:50:36.509 --> 00:50:38.229
<i>some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.</i>

00:50:38.389 --> 00:50:40.109
They didn't open it, did they?

00:50:40.269 --> 00:50:42.429
<i>Uh, yeah, they did.
You better get down here.</i>

00:50:43.269 --> 00:50:45.189
Excuse me! Out of the way!

00:51:12.389 --> 00:51:15.909
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

00:51:16.629 --> 00:51:18.109
Uh, my wife's expecting.

00:51:18.269 --> 00:51:21.109
And too much time at the office.

00:51:22.949 --> 00:51:24.309
Congratulations.

00:51:24.469 --> 00:51:26.629
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
- Yeah, sure.

00:51:27.709 --> 00:51:29.789
- How far along is she?
- Uh, I don't know.

00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:32.709
She's at the point where

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:34.349
she can't stand the
sound of my chewing.

00:51:34.509 --> 00:51:37.949
I guess I'll be eating dinner
in the pantry again.

00:51:38.869 --> 00:51:39.869
I have a little girl.

00:51:40.029 --> 00:51:41.549
A girl would be nice.

00:51:41.709 --> 00:51:43.709
Less of a chance she'd
turn out exactly like me.

00:51:44.389 --> 00:51:45.829
What'd be so awful about that?

00:51:45.989 --> 00:51:48.029
Let's just say that
the greater good

00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:51.389
has rarely outweighed
my own self-interest.

00:51:55.429 --> 00:51:56.589
And you've never seen
these two men before?

00:51:56.709 --> 00:51:58.469
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

00:51:58.629 --> 00:51:59.669
Can you describe them?

00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:00.909
One of them had a hippie beard.

00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:03.229
Hippie.
Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:04.350
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

00:52:04.542 --> 00:52:05.542
Yeah, this is Chesler.

00:52:05.638 --> 00:52:06.798
I need every available
MP to sublevel six.

00:52:06.901 --> 00:52:08.781
We have a potential breach.

00:52:26.709 --> 00:52:27.709
I said bring them in.

00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:28.869
They're trying, ma'am,
but Braddock's unit

00:52:28.949 --> 00:52:29.989
has been stopped
by lightning strikes.

00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:31.109
Oh, for the love of...

00:52:31.189 --> 00:52:32.669
I'll look at the
weather projections.

00:52:56.709 --> 00:52:58.709
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:11.749
So, where you at with names?

00:53:11.909 --> 00:53:15.069
Well, if it's a boy, my
wife likes Elmonzo.

00:53:15.229 --> 00:53:17.189
Huh.
Might wanna let that stew awhile.

00:53:17.269 --> 00:53:18.709
- You got time.
- Uh-huh.

00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:21.589
Let me ask you a question.

00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:25.869
When your kid was
born, were you nervous?

00:53:26.029 --> 00:53:27.509
Wildly.

00:53:27.629 --> 00:53:29.309
- Yeah.
- Did you feel qualified?

00:53:29.509 --> 00:53:31.349
Like you had any idea

00:53:31.429 --> 00:53:33.069
how to successfully
operate that thing?

00:53:33.509 --> 00:53:36.309
I literally pieced it
together as I went along.

00:53:36.509 --> 00:53:38.509
I thought about what my dad did.

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:40.229
My old man,

00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:42.069
he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

00:53:42.149 --> 00:53:44.229
I thought my dad
was tough on me.

00:53:44.389 --> 00:53:45.709
And now, looking back on it,

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:47.109
I just remember the good stuff.

00:53:47.269 --> 00:53:48.829
You know?
He did drop the odd pearl.

00:53:49.029 --> 00:53:50.389
Yeah? Like what?

00:53:51.509 --> 00:53:54.029
"No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."

00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:56.389
Smart guy.

00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:58.269
He did his best.

00:53:59.629 --> 00:54:01.149
I'll tell you, that kid's
not even here yet

00:54:01.229 --> 00:54:03.589
and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:13.749
Good to meet you, Potts.

00:54:14.229 --> 00:54:15.229
Yeah.

00:54:15.669 --> 00:54:16.829
Howard...

00:54:17.429 --> 00:54:18.989
everything's gonna be all right.

00:54:21.989 --> 00:54:23.269
Thank you...

00:54:24.229 --> 00:54:25.549
for everything...

00:54:25.949 --> 00:54:28.269
you've done for this country.

00:54:31.149 --> 00:54:32.269
Jarvis.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.360
Have we ever met that guy?

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.029
You meet a lot of people, sir.

00:54:43.629 --> 00:54:45.269
Seems very familiar.

00:54:46.189 --> 00:54:47.669
Weird beard.

00:54:55.933 --> 00:54:57.293
You're weak.

00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:58.629
I'm you.

00:55:16.269 --> 00:55:18.349
You could stop this.

00:55:18.629 --> 00:55:20.429
You know you want to.

00:55:21.149 --> 00:55:23.309
Did you see what
happens in the future?

00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:26.989
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

00:55:28.509 --> 00:55:30.509
You wanna know how he does that?

00:55:31.909 --> 00:55:36.069
You wanna know
what he does to you?

00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:37.589
That's enough.

00:55:50.269 --> 00:55:51.829
You disgust me.

00:55:53.031 --> 00:55:57.911
But that doesn't
mean you're useless.

00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:21.429
How do I look?

00:56:27.989 --> 00:56:28.989
Wow.

00:56:29.989 --> 00:56:33.109
Under different circumstances...

00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:35.309
this would be totally awesome.

00:56:47.229 --> 00:56:48.589
I bet the raccoon

00:56:48.709 --> 00:56:50.269
didn't have to climb a mountain.

00:56:50.429 --> 00:56:52.349
Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

00:56:52.429 --> 00:56:54.069
Oh, whatever. He eats garbage.

00:56:54.229 --> 00:56:55.589
Welcome.

00:56:58.749 --> 00:57:00.069
Natasha.

00:57:00.229 --> 00:57:01.229
Daughter of Ivan.

00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:03.709
Clint.

00:57:03.869 --> 00:57:06.149
Son of Edith.

00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:12.989
Who are you?

00:57:13.629 --> 00:57:16.069
Consider me a guide...

00:57:16.269 --> 00:57:17.909
to you...

00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:19.909
and to all who
seek the Soul Stone.

00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:21.149
Oh, good.

00:57:21.309 --> 00:57:23.429
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:29.589
If only it were that easy.

00:57:41.709 --> 00:57:45.429
What you seek
lies in front of you.

00:57:46.669 --> 00:57:49.069
As does what you fear.

00:57:53.989 --> 00:57:55.869
The stone's down there.

00:57:56.509 --> 00:57:58.429
For one of you.

00:57:58.709 --> 00:58:00.429
For the other...

00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:05.029
In order to take the stone...

00:58:05.189 --> 00:58:08.189
you must lose
that which you love.

00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:12.709
An everlasting exchange.

00:58:13.749 --> 00:58:17.829
A soul for a soul.

00:58:20.389 --> 00:58:22.989
How's it going?

00:58:25.189 --> 00:58:26.629
Jesus.

00:58:26.949 --> 00:58:28.669
Maybe he's making this shit up.

00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:30.869
No.

00:58:31.709 --> 00:58:32.709
I don't think so.

00:58:33.429 --> 00:58:35.589
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:38.149
I didn't.

00:58:39.526 --> 00:58:41.886
Thanos left here
with the stone...

00:58:42.669 --> 00:58:44.229
without his daughter.

00:58:44.389 --> 00:58:46.469
That's not a coincidence.

00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:49.189
Yeah.

00:58:50.909 --> 00:58:52.789
Whatever it takes.

00:58:57.269 --> 00:58:58.789
Whatever it takes.

00:59:03.149 --> 00:59:05.109
If we don't get that stone...

00:59:05.269 --> 00:59:06.949
billions of people stay dead.

00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:08.989
Yeah.

00:59:10.869 --> 00:59:12.989
Then I guess we both
know who it's gotta be.

00:59:13.749 --> 00:59:14.909
I guess we do.

00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:25.469
I'm starting to think we mean

00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:28.069
different people here, Natasha.

00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:30.389
For the last five years, I've
been trying to do one thing.

00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:31.829
Get to right here.

00:59:31.989 --> 00:59:33.989
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

00:59:34.149 --> 00:59:36.349
No, don't you get all
decent on me now.

00:59:36.509 --> 00:59:38.509
What, you think I wanna do it?

00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:40.869
I'm trying to save
your life, you idiot.

00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:43.349
Yeah, well, I don't want you to.
How's that?

00:59:44.269 --> 00:59:46.469
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

00:59:48.149 --> 00:59:49.949
You know what I've become.

00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:54.669
Oh, I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

00:59:58.829 --> 01:00:00.069
Maybe you should.

01:00:00.949 --> 01:00:02.509
You didn't.

01:00:08.669 --> 01:00:10.869
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

01:00:21.989 --> 01:00:23.189
Okay.

01:00:24.949 --> 01:00:26.469
You win.

01:00:32.909 --> 01:00:34.069
Tell my family I love 'em.

01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:38.989
You tell 'em yourself.

01:01:12.189 --> 01:01:13.189
Damn you.

01:01:20.389 --> 01:01:21.389
Wait.

01:01:29.429 --> 01:01:31.269
Let me go.

01:01:32.509 --> 01:01:33.509
No.

01:01:35.269 --> 01:01:36.269
No. Please, no.

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.469
It's okay.

01:01:43.735 --> 01:01:44.735
Please.

01:01:46.487 --> 01:01:47.487
No!

01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:30.069
Did we get 'em all?

01:03:31.571 --> 01:03:33.371
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

01:03:38.149 --> 01:03:39.349
Clint, where's Nat?

01:04:10.359 --> 01:04:15.281

declining years</i>
