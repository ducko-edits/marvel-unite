00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:27.761
Are you playing around
with that man again?

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:29.222
- No.
- You're teasing him again.

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:32.401
- Don't wake him. He must rest.
- No, I'm not.

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:34.721
No, I'm not.

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:36.881
Thabo, you're doing that.

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.441
He's doing it. He's lying.

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.041
No, he's resting.

00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:41.521
Go, go!

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.481
White Wolf!

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:44.641
Stop that!

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:45.921
White Wolf!

00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:50.281
Good morning, Sergeant Barnes.

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:52.801
Bucky.

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:55.441
How are you feeling?

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:57.081
Good.

00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:00.801
Thank you.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.648
Come.

00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:05.801
Much more for you to learn.

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:50.215
Vis?

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:52.575
Is it the stone again?

00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:54.375
It's as if it's speaking to me.

00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:56.695
What does it say?

00:01:57.615 --> 00:01:59.935
I don't...
I don't know, but something.

00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:03.415
Hey.

00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:15.735
Tell me what you feel.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:25.495
I just feel you.

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:35.575
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...

00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:37.735
which would give us more time
together before you went back.

00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:39.375
What if I miss that train?

00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:40.535
There's an 11:00.

00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:43.095
What if I missed all the trains?

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:46.215
What if this time
I didn't go back?

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:47.695
But you gave Stark your word.

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:49.055
I'd rather give it to you.

00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:51.175
Well, there are people who
are expecting me too, you know.

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:52.655
We both made promises.

00:02:52.855 --> 00:02:54.535
Not to each other.

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:55.975
Wanda.

00:02:56.935 --> 00:02:59.255
For two years, we've
stolen these moments...

00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:01.455
trying to see if this
could work and...

00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:03.215
I don't know.

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:05.335
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:07.215
I think...

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:08.455
- It works.
- It works.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.935
It works.

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:13.655
Stay.

00:03:14.575 --> 00:03:16.215
Stay with me.

00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:24.255
Or not.
If I'm overstepping...

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:33.055
What are they?

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:35.815
What the stone was
warning me about.

00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:47.095
I have to go.

00:03:47.175 --> 00:03:48.175
No, Vision.

00:03:48.815 --> 00:03:50.055
Vision, if that's true,

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:52.935
then maybe going
isn't the best idea.

00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:55.055
Wanda, I...

00:03:55.215 --> 00:03:57.255
Vision!

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:28.095
The blade, it stopped
me from phasing.

00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:30.975
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:33.775
My systems are failing.

00:04:34.695 --> 00:04:37.335
I'm beginning to think we
should have stayed in bed.

00:04:39.895 --> 00:04:40.895
Vis!

00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:53.375
Give up the stone,
and she lives.

00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:32.695
Hands off.

00:05:48.495 --> 00:05:49.775
Come on. Come on.

00:05:49.935 --> 00:05:51.735
Come on, you gotta get up.

00:05:51.895 --> 00:05:54.095
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.

00:05:55.175 --> 00:05:56.615
Hey. We have to go.

00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:01.095
Please.
Please leave.

00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:03.015
You asked me to stay.

00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:05.455
- I'm staying.
- Please.

00:07:16.655 --> 00:07:18.335
- Get up.
- I can't.

00:07:18.535 --> 00:07:21.215
We don't wanna
kill you, but we will.

00:07:21.415 --> 00:07:23.575
You'll never get
the chance again.

00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:41.095
Can you stand?

00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:47.255
Thank you, Captain.

00:07:49.975 --> 00:07:51.575
Let's get you on the jet.

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:58.975
Now, I thought we had a deal.

00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:02.855
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:04.375
I'm sorry.

00:08:04.535 --> 00:08:06.295
We just wanted time.

00:08:09.015 --> 00:08:10.295
Where to, Cap?

00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:14.615
Home.

00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:25.611
Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races

00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:27.451
to infiltrate and
take over planets.

00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:31.540
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:34.331
Heroes.
Noble warrior heroes.

00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:38.091
So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?

00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:41.211
They believe that she developed

00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:43.131
a light-speed engine at Pegasus.

00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:44.851
Light-speed engine?

00:08:45.931 --> 00:08:47.251
Gotta admit, that's not

00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:48.651
the craziest thing
I've heard today.

00:08:48.811 --> 00:08:50.371
Well, it's still early.

00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:52.491
And you, what do you want?

00:08:52.651 --> 00:08:54.931
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

00:08:55.011 --> 00:08:56.011
And?

00:09:00.171 --> 00:09:03.491
Look, war is a
universal language.

00:09:03.651 --> 00:09:06.371
I know a rogue
soldier when I see one.

00:09:06.531 --> 00:09:08.771
You got a personal
stake in this.

00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:20.571
<i>This is government property.</i>

00:09:20.651 --> 00:09:22.491
<i>Turn your vehicle around.</i>

00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:25.691
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:28.051
<i>Place your thumb on the pad.</i>

00:09:29.171 --> 00:09:30.371
<i>One moment.</i>

00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:34.491
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?

00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:36.651
Everybody calls me Fury.

00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:40.691
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph. Not Nick.
Just Fury.

00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:42.251
- What does your mom call you?
- Fury.

00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:43.931
- What do you call her?
- Fury.

00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:45.131
What about your kids?

00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:47.051
If I have them,
they'll call me Fury.

00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:48.451
<i>You are cleared for access.</i>

00:09:48.531 --> 00:09:49.531
Thank you.

00:10:19.571 --> 00:10:20.771
Oh, hold up.

00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:23.971
You look like somebody's
disaffected niece.

00:10:25.971 --> 00:10:26.971
Put that on.

00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:30.411
- What is it?
- It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:33.251
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing

00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:34.811
help with the covert
part of your job?

00:10:34.971 --> 00:10:37.251
Said the space soldier who
was wearing a rubber suit.

00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:39.491
Lose the flannel.

00:10:50.571 --> 00:10:51.931
How can I help you?

00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:54.651
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:10:57.051 --> 00:10:59.011
We're looking for a
woman named Lawson.

00:10:59.171 --> 00:11:01.451
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:04.491
Do you know her?

00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:10.011
Follow me.

00:11:10.691 --> 00:11:11.691
Hmm.

00:11:14.411 --> 00:11:17.651
You familiar with the
phrase "welcome wagon"?

00:11:18.651 --> 00:11:19.651
No.

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:23.251
Well, this ain't it.

00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:31.611
Is that a communicator?

00:11:31.811 --> 00:11:35.091
Yeah. State-of-the-art
two-way pager.

00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:36.331
Who are you paging?

00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:40.171
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

00:12:18.811 --> 00:12:19.811
After you.

00:12:19.971 --> 00:12:21.611
Impressive.

00:12:21.771 --> 00:12:24.491
Oh, you should see what
I can do with a paperclip.

00:12:26.451 --> 00:12:29.091
Bill is filling that
girl's head with lies.

00:12:29.251 --> 00:12:32.451
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

00:12:32.691 --> 00:12:35.011
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.691
No, no, no.
The bolt is on the other side.

00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:40.611
Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:41.771
Good job.

00:12:42.171 --> 00:12:43.171
It'll work.

00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:45.331
Foster, he could have
fried the entire system.

00:12:45.491 --> 00:12:46.691
Look, we'll adjust the relays

00:12:46.771 --> 00:12:48.571
while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?

00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:50.331
It's going to be fine.

00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:57.158
So, this is it.

00:12:57.332 --> 00:12:59.371
Yeah.
You'd think with all this time

00:12:59.451 --> 00:13:00.971
to prepare I'd be more ready.

00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:04.051
Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:06.611
It kind of melts your mind.

00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:08.611
I mean seeing my mom again.

00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:09.931
Oh.

00:13:11.571 --> 00:13:13.811
What if she's a completely
different person?

00:13:14.011 --> 00:13:16.411
Yeah, like, uh,
George Washington.

00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:17.971
I'm serious, Scott.

00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:20.171
Or George Jefferson.

00:13:22.011 --> 00:13:24.051
What if she's
forgotten about me?

00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:27.251
When I was in prison...

00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:29.971
the only thing that got
me through was Cassie.

00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:31.371
I could have been
locked up for 100 years...

00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:32.891
I never would
have forgotten her.

00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:37.171
I know your mom is
counting the minutes

00:13:37.251 --> 00:13:39.211
until she can see you again.

00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:41.971
Thank you.

00:13:49.531 --> 00:13:50.331
Hey.

00:13:50.491 --> 00:13:51.811
We got a big problem.

00:13:52.011 --> 00:13:52.891
You forgot the
motion sensor lights

00:13:52.971 --> 00:13:53.771
on the back of the building.

00:13:53.931 --> 00:13:55.411
Oh, no.

00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:57.091
And they're on the proposal,

00:13:57.171 --> 00:13:58.651
and Karapetyan asked
for them specifically.

00:13:58.811 --> 00:14:02.211
Uh, yeah, look, it's
been a little crazy.

00:14:03.171 --> 00:14:04.931
Look, maybe I could stop
by tomorrow, take a look at it.

00:14:05.091 --> 00:14:05.971
No. No, no, no, no.

00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:07.291
The meeting is first
thing in the morning.

00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:08.531
You gotta come
right now and fix it.

00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:10.971
I can't.
I wish I could, but I can't leave.

00:14:11.131 --> 00:14:12.131
You know what,
I'm coming to you.

00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:14.731
I'll just bring the plans.
They're on the laptop.

00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:16.171
And you can fix them there.

00:14:16.251 --> 00:14:17.571
Just tell me where
you are, okay?

00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:18.651
It's complicated.

00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:20.091
What do you mean
it's complicated?

00:14:24.171 --> 00:14:26.251
As you can see, sir,

00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:28.371
this system is state of the art.

00:14:28.531 --> 00:14:30.771
Security of tomorrow, today.

00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:32.131
Oh, that's so good!

00:14:32.211 --> 00:14:33.771
And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicin'.

00:14:33.931 --> 00:14:34.891
Hey, I just gotta
drive up to Scotty's,

00:14:34.971 --> 00:14:35.891
so we can fix the plans.

00:14:36.091 --> 00:14:37.491
But don't worry, I'll be
back in plenty of time.

00:14:37.651 --> 00:14:39.971
- As you can see...
- Oh, oh, oh!

00:14:40.731 --> 00:14:42.411
Tell me you got the van
washed for tomorrow morning.

00:14:42.571 --> 00:14:44.131
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:45.611
You sprung for the
undercarriage wash?

00:14:45.811 --> 00:14:47.011
Well, you said get the works.

00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:49.251
That's a scam, bro.
We live in California, not Minnesota.

00:14:49.411 --> 00:14:50.571
He's right.

00:14:51.331 --> 00:14:53.451
The undercarriage wash,

00:14:53.531 --> 00:14:55.051
that's for cleaning
off road salt...

00:14:55.211 --> 00:14:58.411
laid down in our more
snow-laden sister states.

00:14:58.611 --> 00:14:59.771
Who are you, and why
do you know so much

00:14:59.851 --> 00:15:01.051
about car wash protocol?

00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:03.571
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

00:15:03.731 --> 00:15:06.251
And I do my research, Luis.

00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:10.771
To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine...

00:15:10.931 --> 00:15:12.571
at the FBI that you are

00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:14.291
a known associate
of Scott Lang...

00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:17.411
a known associate of Hank
Pym, who I've also learned...

00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:20.211
has a portable
shrinking laboratory...

00:15:20.371 --> 00:15:22.731
filled with all
kinds of juicy tech.

00:15:22.931 --> 00:15:25.571
And you're gonna
tell me where it is.

00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:27.251
Well, I hate to break it to you,

00:15:27.331 --> 00:15:29.451
but I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:15:30.091 --> 00:15:32.531
Well, I sense a
resistance in you, Luis.

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:35.611
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

00:15:35.771 --> 00:15:39.611
So, I'm gonna introduce
you to my good friend, Uzman.

00:15:40.651 --> 00:15:42.131
Now...

00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:44.131
Uzman is a master

00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:46.251
at extracting information
from the unwilling...

00:15:46.451 --> 00:15:47.891
through psychoactive means.

00:15:49.891 --> 00:15:51.251
Oh, is that truth serum?

00:15:51.811 --> 00:15:53.811
There's no such
thing as truth serum.

00:15:53.971 --> 00:15:55.331
That's just nonsense from TV.

00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:57.131
Well, what is it then?

00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:58.851
It's a little concoction

00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:01.651
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.

00:16:01.811 --> 00:16:04.691
It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.

00:16:04.891 --> 00:16:05.931
Well, dude, that's truth serum.

00:16:06.011 --> 00:16:06.731
No, it's not.

00:16:06.931 --> 00:16:09.931
No offensing, but they
sound like truth serum to me.

00:16:10.091 --> 00:16:12.131
- Right?
- It's not a truth serum.

00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:13.611
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

00:16:13.811 --> 00:16:15.011
It's not a truth serum.

00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:18.491
I mean, if it walk like
duck and talk like ducks...

00:16:18.651 --> 00:16:19.691
The truth serum.

00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:21.611
Well, I have a
lot of allergies...

00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:23.611
so you might wanna
think about that.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.251
We've got to get that lab back.

00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:30.491
What?

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.811
The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.

00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:37.211
How long have I got?

00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:42.091
A couple of weeks, maybe.

00:16:44.411 --> 00:16:46.651
Well, then we'll make
them bring the lab back.

00:16:46.811 --> 00:16:47.771
How?

00:16:48.971 --> 00:16:51.211
Lang.
He has a daughter, right?

00:16:51.371 --> 00:16:52.411
You can't mean that.

00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:53.971
Ava!

00:16:55.891 --> 00:16:57.771
I tolerate a lot of the
things you do out there...

00:16:57.931 --> 00:16:59.771
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:01.451
You're not the one who's about

00:17:01.571 --> 00:17:03.291
to fade away into nothing, Bill.

00:17:03.491 --> 00:17:04.531
I am!

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:06.999
You said you could fix me!

00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:11.531
You promised.

00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:13.531
I know. I will.

00:17:13.691 --> 00:17:14.971
But not like that.

00:17:17.531 --> 00:17:19.571
You lay one finger
on that little girl...

00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:22.531
I won't help you.
And we're done.

00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:29.771
Fine.

00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:32.731
There are other options.

00:17:46.531 --> 00:17:48.771
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

00:17:48.931 --> 00:17:50.131
Because I don't feel anything.

00:17:50.331 --> 00:17:52.011
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.051
This is truth serum!

00:17:53.211 --> 00:17:54.171
There's no such thing!

00:17:54.371 --> 00:17:55.891
Okay.

00:17:56.051 --> 00:17:58.251
Okay, okay.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.691
Now, I'm gonna make
this real easy for you, Luis.

00:18:00.851 --> 00:18:02.291
Okay.

00:18:04.331 --> 00:18:07.411
Where is Scott Lang?

00:18:07.851 --> 00:18:08.971
Well, see, that's complicated.

00:18:09.131 --> 00:18:10.931
Because when I first met
Scotty, he was in a bad place.

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:12.531
<i>And I'm not talkin'
about cell block D.</i>

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.211
<i>His wife had just filed for
divorce, and I was, like...</i>

00:18:14.371 --> 00:18:16.291
<i>"Damn, homie.
She dumped you when you're on lockup?"</i>

00:18:16.451 --> 00:18:17.411
<i>And he was, like, "Yeah, I know.</i>

00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:18.411
<i>"I thought I was gonna
be with her forever...</i>

00:18:18.651 --> 00:18:19.531
<i>"but now I'm all alone."</i>

00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:20.771
<i>And I was, like, "Damn, homie.
You know what?</i>

00:18:20.931 --> 00:18:22.171
<i>"You gotta chin up, because
you'll find a new partner.</i>

00:18:22.331 --> 00:18:23.611
<i>"But you know what? I'm Luis."</i>

00:18:23.771 --> 00:18:24.851
<i>And he says, "You know what?
I'm Scotty,</i>

00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:25.971
<i>"and we're gonna
be best friends."</i>

00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:27.011
Okay, hold on, hold on.

00:18:27.171 --> 00:18:28.731
I like a good story as
much as the next person...

00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:30.051
but what in the hell
does this have to do

00:18:30.131 --> 00:18:31.291
with where Scott Lang is?

00:18:31.491 --> 00:18:32.331
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

00:18:32.491 --> 00:18:33.731
You put a dime in him,

00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:35.011
you gotta let the
whole song play out.

00:18:35.211 --> 00:18:36.891
He like human jukebox.

00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:38.731
Oh, my <i>abuelita </i>had a
jukebox in the restaurant!

00:18:38.891 --> 00:18:41.131
<i>Yeah, only played Morrissey.</i>

00:18:41.291 --> 00:18:42.731
<i>And if anybody ever
complained, she'd be like...</i>

00:18:43.931 --> 00:18:45.411
<i>You know, Chicanos,
we call him "Moz."</i>

00:18:45.571 --> 00:18:46.531
<i>Then</i>, ¡adios!

00:18:46.691 --> 00:18:48.091
What can I say? We relate to his

00:18:48.171 --> 00:18:49.491
melancholy ballads, you know?

00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:50.931
- Lang!
- Right, right, right.

00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:52.131
So, anyway, Scotty
gets out of jail,

00:18:52.211 --> 00:18:53.171
and he starts working for Hank.

00:18:53.331 --> 00:18:54.491
<i>That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...</i>

00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:56.011
<i>"I want nothing to do with you.</i>

00:18:56.091 --> 00:18:57.691
<i>"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business."</i>

00:18:57.891 --> 00:18:58.851
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

00:18:58.931 --> 00:18:59.931
<i>"You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.</i>

00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:01.131
<i>"And I'll probably
never find love again,</i>

00:19:01.211 --> 00:19:02.331
<i>"but damn if I
want to kiss you!"</i>

00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:03.451
<i>But then you fast forward</i>

00:19:03.531 --> 00:19:04.491
<i>and they're all into
each other, right?</i>

00:19:04.691 --> 00:19:05.571
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

00:19:05.651 --> 00:19:06.891
<i>"You know what?
I can't tell you this...</i>

00:19:07.051 --> 00:19:08.971
<i>"but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America."</i>

00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:10.731
<i>And then she said, "I can't
believe you split like that!</i>

00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:12.331
<i>"Smell you later, dummy."</i>

00:19:12.531 --> 00:19:13.571
So, Scotty goes on house arrest.

00:19:13.731 --> 00:19:15.211
<i>And he won't admit it,
but his heart is all, like...</i>

00:19:15.411 --> 00:19:16.811
<i>"Damn!
I thought Hope coulda been</i>

00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:18.651
<i>"my new true
partner, but I blew it!"</i>

00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:19.811
<i>But fate brought
'em back together.</i>

00:19:19.971 --> 00:19:20.931
And then Hope's heart is all...

00:19:21.131 --> 00:19:22.691
<i>"I'm worried that
I can't trust him...</i>

00:19:22.851 --> 00:19:24.451
<i>"and he's gonna screw up
again, and ruin everything!"</i>

00:19:24.611 --> 00:19:25.811
And then my
heart is all, like...

00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:27.731
<i>"That fancy raspberry filling
represents the company's red</i>

00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:29.611
<i>"and we're days away from
going out of business. Oh!"</i>

00:19:29.771 --> 00:19:30.611
"Out of business"?

00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:31.651
"Days away"?

00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:32.811
Damn truth serum!

00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:35.011
I was trying to protect you guys.
I swear to God.

00:19:35.171 --> 00:19:37.051
I was trying to be a good
boss, but we're broke!

00:19:37.211 --> 00:19:38.051
And the Karapetyan's
our last hope.

00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:39.051
And if we don't
show up, we're done!

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:40.331
That's terrible bossing!

00:19:40.491 --> 00:19:41.371
Damn, bro!

00:19:41.531 --> 00:19:42.531
- That's on me! That's on me!
- Hey!

00:19:43.691 --> 00:19:45.291
Enough.

00:19:47.611 --> 00:19:49.451
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:52.131
Where is Scott Lang?

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:53.251
I've been trying to tell you,

00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:54.331
he's in a tricky spot,
emotionally speaking.

00:19:54.491 --> 00:19:55.811
Emotionally speaking.

00:19:55.971 --> 00:19:59.011
Well, where is Scott
Lang, literally speaking!

00:19:59.211 --> 00:20:00.451
Oh! The woods.

00:20:00.611 --> 00:20:01.651
The woods?

00:20:02.051 --> 00:20:03.371
Baba Yaga!

00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:06.091
What do you mean, "the woods"?

00:20:06.251 --> 00:20:07.331
The Muir Woods,
the second fire road

00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:08.531
off the Panoramic Highway!

00:20:08.691 --> 00:20:09.811
For God's sake!

00:20:11.771 --> 00:20:13.491
<i>Baba Yaga, come at night</i>

00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:15.931
<i>Little children, sleepy tight</i>

00:20:18.211 --> 00:20:19.851
Damn it!

00:20:21.491 --> 00:20:22.891
If that freak gets Pym's tech...

00:20:23.051 --> 00:20:24.571
I'm never gonna see it.

00:20:24.771 --> 00:20:25.811
So, what do we do now?

00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:28.851
It's easier to steal
it from the Feds

00:20:28.931 --> 00:20:30.251
than from the boogeyman.

00:20:32.771 --> 00:20:35.851
Hey, it's me.
How'd you like to get a promotion?

00:20:36.011 --> 00:20:39.731
I got the location on
Pym, Van Dyne and Lang.

00:20:39.891 --> 00:20:41.131
But you gonna have
to take 'em down now,

00:20:41.211 --> 00:20:42.971
because they ain't
gonna be there for long.

00:20:43.131 --> 00:20:45.211
And when you do, you
gonna get me that lab.

00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:47.491
Understood.

00:20:48.691 --> 00:20:50.291
Good news, gentlemen.

00:20:50.451 --> 00:20:52.651
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

00:20:53.331 --> 00:20:55.211
What are you lookin' at?
Change my tires!

00:20:55.371 --> 00:20:56.211
Right.

00:20:58.051 --> 00:21:00.451
- Sir.
- Can you knock?

00:21:01.491 --> 00:21:04.011
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:06.935
Ooh, I love leads.

00:21:16.744 --> 00:21:19.064
Hey, there. How are you?

00:21:20.904 --> 00:21:23.704
Oh, my goodness.
Look at you. Just look at you.

00:21:23.904 --> 00:21:26.264
Aren't you the
cutest little thing?

00:21:26.424 --> 00:21:28.664
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?

00:21:28.744 --> 00:21:29.744
What's your name?

00:21:29.904 --> 00:21:32.704
"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.

00:21:32.784 --> 00:21:33.784
Fury?

00:21:34.104 --> 00:21:35.104
Hmm?

00:21:37.304 --> 00:21:38.584
I'll be back.

00:21:41.763 --> 00:21:43.883
Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.

00:21:44.264 --> 00:21:45.704
Just let me unravel this puppy.

00:21:50.024 --> 00:21:52.304
You sat there and
watched me play with tape?

00:21:52.464 --> 00:21:53.464
When all you had to do was...

00:21:53.624 --> 00:21:55.144
I didn't wanna
steal your thunder.

00:22:12.224 --> 00:22:14.344
Huh. Lawson.

00:22:24.344 --> 00:22:27.504
Lawson's plan for
the light-speed engine.

00:22:28.667 --> 00:22:30.147
I wonder why they
terminated the project.

00:22:30.961 --> 00:22:35.321
Um, maybe because she's cuckoo.

00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:39.184
Kree glyphs?

00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:40.744
Hmm?

00:22:42.064 --> 00:22:43.704
Lawson is not cuckoo.

00:22:45.859 --> 00:22:47.499
She's Kree.

00:22:47.824 --> 00:22:50.224
Well, she's dead.

00:22:50.424 --> 00:22:51.864
What?

00:22:52.024 --> 00:22:53.704
She crashed the Asis aircraft

00:22:53.784 --> 00:22:55.664
doing an
unauthorized test flight.

00:22:55.864 --> 00:22:57.824
Took a pilot down with her.

00:22:57.984 --> 00:23:00.144
That's why security
here is so unfriendly.

00:23:00.344 --> 00:23:03.384
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.

00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:07.437
Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.

00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:12.704
When did this crash happen?

00:23:13.504 --> 00:23:16.544
Six years ago. 1989.

00:23:17.704 --> 00:23:19.144
Who was the pilot?

00:23:19.984 --> 00:23:23.144
Um, most of this
thing's redacted...

00:23:23.304 --> 00:23:27.424
but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.

00:23:27.624 --> 00:23:29.704
Last person to see them alive.

00:23:35.024 --> 00:23:36.184
You okay?

00:23:37.984 --> 00:23:39.144
Mm-hmm.

00:23:40.744 --> 00:23:42.024
Back in a minute.

00:24:26.072 --> 00:24:27.232
Where's your head at?

00:24:28.272 --> 00:24:30.472
In the clouds. Where's yours?

00:24:30.672 --> 00:24:32.192
On my shoulders.

00:24:32.272 --> 00:24:33.912
About to show these
boys how we do it.

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:35.472
You ready?

00:24:35.552 --> 00:24:36.552
Higher, further, faster, baby.

00:24:36.632 --> 00:24:37.632
That's right.

00:24:49.432 --> 00:24:50.832
Goose likes you.

00:24:50.992 --> 00:24:52.392
She doesn't typically
take to people.

00:24:52.552 --> 00:24:53.872
Early start to your morning.

00:24:54.032 --> 00:24:55.192
Uh, late night, actually.

00:24:55.352 --> 00:24:57.272
I can't sleep when
there's work to do.

00:24:57.432 --> 00:24:58.432
Sound familiar?

00:24:58.592 --> 00:25:00.112
Flying your planes
never feels like work.

00:25:01.952 --> 00:25:03.072
Wonderful view, isn't it?

00:25:03.232 --> 00:25:05.072
I prefer the view from up there.

00:25:05.272 --> 00:25:06.392
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

00:25:08.354 --> 00:25:10.234
This isn't about fighting wars.

00:25:10.947 --> 00:25:12.467
It's about ending them.

00:25:28.692 --> 00:25:29.852
System's in the green.

00:25:30.012 --> 00:25:31.612
Priming the coils.

00:25:33.972 --> 00:25:35.012
Full charge.

00:25:35.172 --> 00:25:36.212
As soon as the tunnel's open...

00:25:36.372 --> 00:25:37.452
let us know if you get anything

00:25:37.532 --> 00:25:38.492
that could be a
part of her message.

00:25:38.652 --> 00:25:39.972
Yeah, yeah. I will.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.530
Okay, then.

00:25:46.292 --> 00:25:47.292
Here it goes.

00:26:01.172 --> 00:26:02.772
We did it!

00:26:03.292 --> 00:26:04.812
You got anything?

00:26:08.012 --> 00:26:08.932
Nothin'.

00:26:09.452 --> 00:26:11.812
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

00:26:13.132 --> 00:26:14.492
No.

00:26:14.652 --> 00:26:16.212
No, no, no, no!

00:26:16.412 --> 00:26:17.292
What's happening?

00:26:17.452 --> 00:26:19.172
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

00:26:19.332 --> 00:26:21.612
We've gone over them a
million times, I know they're right!

00:26:21.772 --> 00:26:22.692
Then what else could it be?

00:26:22.852 --> 00:26:24.652
I don't know!

00:26:30.452 --> 00:26:32.092
- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!

00:26:32.252 --> 00:26:33.132
Scott, you can't...

00:26:33.292 --> 00:26:34.972
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

00:26:35.132 --> 00:26:36.332
I need to fix the algorithm.

00:26:38.415 --> 00:26:40.735
Trust me, after
30 years down here...

00:26:41.052 --> 00:26:42.732
I've thought about it a lot.

00:26:47.092 --> 00:26:48.212
Janet?

00:26:51.052 --> 00:26:52.492
Hi, honey.

00:26:55.932 --> 00:26:57.412
Jellybean.

00:26:57.972 --> 00:26:59.172
Mom?

00:27:00.212 --> 00:27:01.812
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

00:27:01.972 --> 00:27:03.732
It's all so rushed.

00:27:03.892 --> 00:27:06.212
You two have done
such great work.

00:27:06.372 --> 00:27:08.332
You just need a little...

00:27:08.732 --> 00:27:10.052
nudge.

00:27:25.252 --> 00:27:27.772
Janet, how is this possible?

00:27:29.292 --> 00:27:30.732
It wasn't a message you put

00:27:30.812 --> 00:27:32.132
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

00:27:32.292 --> 00:27:33.852
Clever girl.

00:27:34.292 --> 00:27:36.372
I'm so proud of you.

00:27:36.532 --> 00:27:38.212
Honey, tell us where you are.

00:27:38.412 --> 00:27:39.972
Tell us how to find you.

00:27:40.132 --> 00:27:41.972
No, the probability
fields are too complex.

00:27:42.132 --> 00:27:43.492
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

00:27:43.652 --> 00:27:45.092
You have to follow my voice.

00:27:45.492 --> 00:27:46.572
Of course!

00:27:46.732 --> 00:27:48.612
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

00:27:53.572 --> 00:27:56.692
I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

00:27:56.892 --> 00:27:59.132
between point two
and point nine.

00:27:59.292 --> 00:28:00.852
I'd narrow it to four and six.

00:28:01.012 --> 00:28:02.132
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

00:28:02.292 --> 00:28:03.892
Look at us squabbling again.

00:28:04.852 --> 00:28:07.452
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

00:28:07.732 --> 00:28:11.012
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

00:28:25.372 --> 00:28:27.172
Bullseye.

00:28:27.612 --> 00:28:28.892
Source lock.

00:28:29.092 --> 00:28:30.572
It's you.

00:28:31.348 --> 00:28:32.772
We got it!

00:28:33.412 --> 00:28:35.492
You have to meet me at
these exact coordinates.

00:28:35.652 --> 00:28:38.172
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

00:28:38.332 --> 00:28:39.492
It's very dangerous,

00:28:39.572 --> 00:28:41.612
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

00:28:41.812 --> 00:28:44.332
Time and space work
very differently down here.

00:28:44.492 --> 00:28:45.892
You have two hours.

00:28:46.052 --> 00:28:47.732
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:48.852
and it'll be another century

00:28:48.932 --> 00:28:50.372
before they align
like this again.

00:28:50.572 --> 00:28:52.572
We'll find you.

00:28:58.892 --> 00:29:01.412
I know you will, Jellybean.

00:29:05.972 --> 00:29:07.452
Nope.

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:09.452
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

00:29:09.612 --> 00:29:10.652
Perfect.

00:29:12.652 --> 00:29:14.132
How did we get up here?

00:29:19.052 --> 00:29:20.692
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:22.012
and it's gonna
get really trippy...

00:29:22.172 --> 00:29:24.892
but then it's gonna turn
black and silent. Really silent.

00:29:25.092 --> 00:29:26.492
Scott, I'll be fine.

00:29:26.972 --> 00:29:28.172
I'm just saying because
I've been down there.

00:29:28.332 --> 00:29:29.692
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

00:29:32.629 --> 00:29:34.549
Um, sorry. I have to take this.

00:29:35.972 --> 00:29:37.292
<i>Hey, man, you coming?</i>

00:29:37.335 --> 00:29:39.052
No, I'm not, but you know what?
Ghost is.

00:29:39.212 --> 00:29:41.332
And you know what?
The Feds, they know where you are.

00:29:41.457 --> 00:29:42.697
- What?
<i>- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:44.132
Uh, they gave me
some truth serum.

00:29:44.332 --> 00:29:45.092
And then all of a sudden

00:29:45.172 --> 00:29:46.372
I started talkin' all honestly.

00:29:46.532 --> 00:29:48.132
Like, I hate the way that
you load the dishwasher.

00:29:48.252 --> 00:29:49.452
<i>I hate it, I hate it.</i>

00:29:49.532 --> 00:29:50.452
- Uh...
<i>- But you need to go home...</i>

00:29:50.612 --> 00:29:52.092
because the Feds are
probably going there now!

00:29:52.252 --> 00:29:53.132
And by the way...

00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:55.892
who puts the plates on the top rack?
They don't go there!

00:30:05.532 --> 00:30:06.932
I feel like such a jerk.

00:30:07.092 --> 00:30:09.412
You're gonna be really mad.
We gotta go now.

00:30:09.572 --> 00:30:10.492
What?

00:30:10.692 --> 00:30:12.732
Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.

00:30:12.892 --> 00:30:13.972
How?

00:30:14.132 --> 00:30:16.052
- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?

00:30:16.212 --> 00:30:17.212
I told him to come
here so I could help him

00:30:17.292 --> 00:30:18.452
with the Karapetyan proposal.

00:30:18.612 --> 00:30:19.692
Oh, my God!

00:30:20.372 --> 00:30:21.852
Look, we need to
land that account.

00:30:21.932 --> 00:30:23.132
Otherwise, we lose the business!

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.172
Do you know hard
it is for ex-cons

00:30:24.292 --> 00:30:25.092
to find work these days?

00:30:25.292 --> 00:30:26.652
Jesus, Scott!

00:30:36.452 --> 00:30:37.772
90 seconds to
close the aperture!

00:30:37.972 --> 00:30:39.692
You have to
depolarize the coils first!

00:30:39.892 --> 00:30:40.572
I know!

00:30:40.732 --> 00:30:42.212
I'm really sorry...

00:30:43.012 --> 00:30:45.532
but the, um, FBI is
coming to my place so...

00:30:45.732 --> 00:30:47.172
I have to go.

00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:50.612
Can I borrow the suit?

00:30:52.012 --> 00:30:53.492
<i>Gyroscopic stabilizers.</i>

00:30:53.932 --> 00:30:55.372
<i>Powering on.</i>

00:30:55.612 --> 00:30:57.492
I'm just gonna borrow the suit.

00:30:57.932 --> 00:30:59.892
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

00:31:00.052 --> 00:31:01.612
- Don't bother.
- What?

00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:02.852
We'll come and get
the suit from you,

00:31:02.932 --> 00:31:04.012
as soon as we've found my mom.

00:31:04.172 --> 00:31:06.372
- Hope...
- Scott, just go!

00:31:23.923 --> 00:31:25.532
- Scott?
- Daddy?

00:31:25.692 --> 00:31:26.812
It's us, buddy!

00:31:26.972 --> 00:31:29.172
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

00:31:29.572 --> 00:31:30.732
He must be resting.

00:31:30.892 --> 00:31:31.972
Honey, why don't you go upstairs

00:31:32.052 --> 00:31:33.132
and look under your bed?

00:31:33.292 --> 00:31:35.452
Daddy, you upstairs?

00:31:36.452 --> 00:31:38.052
Daddy?

00:31:39.252 --> 00:31:40.252
What the...

00:31:41.532 --> 00:31:44.012
He really lives like
a pig these days.

00:31:47.252 --> 00:31:48.412
Daddy?

00:31:55.892 --> 00:31:57.652
Spread out!

00:31:58.052 --> 00:31:58.892
Again?

00:31:59.092 --> 00:32:00.372
You people have no shame!

00:32:00.852 --> 00:32:02.372
The monitor says that
he's in the bathroom.

00:32:02.532 --> 00:32:03.492
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

00:32:06.292 --> 00:32:08.212
Cassie, let the man get by!

00:32:08.372 --> 00:32:09.932
But Daddy's super sick!

00:32:10.092 --> 00:32:11.292
I'll see about that!

00:32:11.452 --> 00:32:13.332
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

00:32:13.492 --> 00:32:14.772
I'll take my chances, sweetie.

00:32:15.052 --> 00:32:17.132
He barfed.
Like, a lot.

00:32:17.292 --> 00:32:18.772
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.

00:32:18.932 --> 00:32:20.932
I've seen worse
things than vomit.

00:32:21.944 --> 00:32:22.732
Like, "a lot" a lot?

00:32:22.892 --> 00:32:24.612
- Yes!
- Forget it, move aside!

00:32:25.052 --> 00:32:26.012
No!

00:32:29.412 --> 00:32:31.532
Woo!

00:32:33.252 --> 00:32:35.292
- What are you doing here?
- Scott.

00:32:36.732 --> 00:32:39.452
I'm sorry, I'm just really sick.

00:32:39.652 --> 00:32:40.732
I told you.

00:32:41.412 --> 00:32:42.212
Excuse me.

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:44.773
Sometimes you gotta just get it out.
You know?

00:32:44.904 --> 00:32:46.184
Sorry.

00:32:53.012 --> 00:32:54.532
I'll start the van.

00:32:54.732 --> 00:32:56.892
You get the lab.

00:32:59.332 --> 00:33:01.212
Freeze!
You're surrounded!

00:33:15.252 --> 00:33:16.732
Hank Pym...

00:33:16.892 --> 00:33:18.332
Hope Van Dyne...

00:33:18.492 --> 00:33:19.652
you're under arrest.

00:33:21.375 --> 00:33:22.255
This is harassment!

00:33:22.415 --> 00:33:23.535
Actually, it's not.

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:25.175
What does the
FBI even stand for...

00:33:25.335 --> 00:33:27.735
"Forever Bothering Individuals"?

00:33:29.175 --> 00:33:31.215
- His monitor check out?
- Of course it does.

00:33:31.855 --> 00:33:33.095
Damn it!

00:33:33.255 --> 00:33:35.655
Looks like I just got
fed a bowl of malarkey.

00:33:36.205 --> 00:33:38.285
We got 'em sir.
Pym and Van Dyne are in custody.

00:33:38.855 --> 00:33:40.255
Seriously?
Yes!

00:33:41.855 --> 00:33:43.295
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

00:33:43.375 --> 00:33:45.055
They're your friends.
That's insensitive.

00:33:45.975 --> 00:33:47.495
I just really needed
a win, you know?

00:33:48.061 --> 00:33:49.175
Anyway, I'll be back later

00:33:49.255 --> 00:33:50.960
for the official end
of your sentence!

00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:52.909
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

00:33:53.234 --> 00:33:55.101
You should feel
great about yourself!

00:34:18.998 --> 00:34:19.799
What is it?

00:34:19.855 --> 00:34:20.815
We have a man down.

00:34:20.887 --> 00:34:22.647
And Pym's lab is gone.

00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:28.981
<i>I know Lawson was Kree.</i>

00:34:29.181 --> 00:34:32.061
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

00:34:32.261 --> 00:34:34.901
<i>Do you know anything about this?</i>

00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:36.661
I just discovered
a mission report

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:38.341
sent from C-53.

00:34:38.501 --> 00:34:39.541
There's only so much

00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:42.261
I'm cleared to
tell you, Vers, but...

00:34:46.021 --> 00:34:50.101
<i>Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.</i>

00:34:50.261 --> 00:34:53.861
She was working on
a unique energy core.

00:34:54.021 --> 00:34:55.341
Experimenting with tech

00:34:55.421 --> 00:34:58.261
that apparently could
help us win the war.

00:35:05.404 --> 00:35:06.330
She still here?

00:35:06.421 --> 00:35:08.901
She's cooperating with
the investigation, sir.

00:35:09.061 --> 00:35:11.021
- You men stay here.
- Yes, sir.

00:35:11.101 --> 00:35:13.061
I want to question her alone.

00:35:14.741 --> 00:35:17.021
Excellent work, Nicholas.

00:35:20.526 --> 00:35:22.581
Does it say anything about me?

00:35:22.741 --> 00:35:24.421
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

00:35:24.581 --> 00:35:25.581
<i>Why would it?</i>

00:35:25.741 --> 00:35:28.861
I found evidence
that I had a life here.

00:35:29.021 --> 00:35:30.661
<i>On C-53?</i>

00:35:33.061 --> 00:35:34.461
Mar-Vell is who I see

00:35:34.541 --> 00:35:35.901
when I visit the
Supreme Intelligence.

00:35:36.061 --> 00:35:39.261
I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.

00:35:39.421 --> 00:35:41.661
This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.

00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:43.621
No, it's not.
Because I remember. I was here.

00:35:43.781 --> 00:35:45.541
<i>Stop. Remember your training.</i>

00:35:45.701 --> 00:35:47.981
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

00:35:48.141 --> 00:35:51.461
<i>Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.</i>

00:35:52.941 --> 00:35:54.621
She's on sublevel six.

00:35:54.821 --> 00:35:56.181
I'll get off on five...

00:35:56.341 --> 00:35:58.461
and take the stairs in
case she makes a run for it.

00:35:59.541 --> 00:36:02.501
Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.

00:36:02.741 --> 00:36:05.701
Right. Like we did in Havana.

00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:17.741
<i>We're nearing the jump point.</i>

00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:19.461
<i>Leave your beacon
on so I can find you.</i>

00:36:20.101 --> 00:36:22.381
We'll get to the
bottom of this, Vers.

00:36:22.541 --> 00:36:24.181
Together.

00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:28.061
Okay.

00:36:45.741 --> 00:36:47.221
Vers!

00:36:48.941 --> 00:36:50.181
Vers!

00:37:07.061 --> 00:37:08.661
Fury's colluding
with the target.

00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:10.101
Then why would he call us in?

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:12.701
All I know is we take him in, too.
Dead or alive.

00:37:12.901 --> 00:37:14.181
Dead or alive?

00:37:29.021 --> 00:37:30.301
Go. Go, go!

00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:44.901
Was it something I said?

00:38:02.941 --> 00:38:03.981
Mmm-mmm.

00:38:23.581 --> 00:38:27.461
Now, you know, I don't
really need these to see...

00:38:28.101 --> 00:38:32.101
but they do kinda
complete the look.

00:38:32.741 --> 00:38:34.021
Don't you think?

00:38:51.581 --> 00:38:52.581
You called them in?

00:38:52.741 --> 00:38:54.141
My bad.

00:39:08.541 --> 00:39:10.221
Coulson, do you
have eyes on them?

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:12.061
They're not down here.

00:39:13.695 --> 00:39:14.735
Let's try up there.

00:39:48.904 --> 00:39:50.504
Do you know how
to fly this thing?

00:39:50.664 --> 00:39:51.664
Uh, we'll see.

00:39:51.864 --> 00:39:53.344
That's a yes or no question.

00:39:57.808 --> 00:39:58.808
Yes.

00:40:02.064 --> 00:40:03.464
That's what I'm talking about!

00:40:30.784 --> 00:40:32.064
We got a stowaway.

00:40:36.184 --> 00:40:37.264
Hang on, Goose.

00:40:42.871 --> 00:40:43.871
Goose.

00:40:46.704 --> 00:40:47.704
No, Goose.

00:40:49.104 --> 00:40:52.184
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?

00:40:52.664 --> 00:40:54.344
Yes, that's right.

00:40:54.504 --> 00:40:56.344
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

00:40:56.704 --> 00:40:57.984
You the good
kitty, that's right.

00:40:58.064 --> 00:40:59.224
See anyone you know?

00:41:01.064 --> 00:41:02.504
Funny story.

00:41:02.664 --> 00:41:06.344
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.

00:41:07.184 --> 00:41:08.304
That was six years ago.

00:41:08.464 --> 00:41:10.624
So, you think you're the pilot

00:41:10.704 --> 00:41:11.864
that went down with Dr. Lawson?

00:41:12.144 --> 00:41:14.464
I'm saying the last
person to see them alive

00:41:14.544 --> 00:41:15.544
could probably tell us.

00:41:15.704 --> 00:41:17.304
- Maria Rambeau?
- Mm-hmm.

00:41:17.464 --> 00:41:19.224
So, how do we get to Louisiana?

00:41:20.104 --> 00:41:22.664
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.

00:41:24.224 --> 00:41:26.104
That agent...

00:41:26.264 --> 00:41:28.184
that stopped the
Skrulls from finding us?

00:41:28.344 --> 00:41:30.264
Coulson. The new guy.

00:41:30.424 --> 00:41:31.704
I guess he doesn't hate me yet.

00:41:31.944 --> 00:41:33.624
Yeah, well, give him time.

00:41:35.213 --> 00:41:37.224
I guess he had a
feeling, you know?

00:41:37.464 --> 00:41:39.584
Went with his
gut against orders.

00:41:39.744 --> 00:41:41.064
That's a really
hard thing to do.

00:41:41.304 --> 00:41:43.144
But it's what keeps us human.

00:41:43.344 --> 00:41:45.664
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

00:41:45.742 --> 00:41:46.822
Oh, I can see that about you.

00:41:48.234 --> 00:41:51.854
Rescuing the guy who
sold you out to the Skrulls?

00:41:52.424 --> 00:41:53.624
I'm guessing that's not

00:41:53.704 --> 00:41:55.304
standard Kree
operating procedure.

00:41:55.504 --> 00:41:57.624
Well, I won't tell your
boss if you don't tell mine.

00:42:05.904 --> 00:42:06.904
Ronan.

00:42:07.064 --> 00:42:08.944
<i>The Accusers completed
their operation...</i>

00:42:09.104 --> 00:42:10.504
<i>but the greater
mission was a failure,</i>

00:42:10.624 --> 00:42:11.704
<i>thanks to your team.</i>

00:42:11.864 --> 00:42:13.344
It was a trap

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:16.064
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

00:42:16.224 --> 00:42:17.504
<i>Give us their location.</i>

00:42:17.584 --> 00:42:19.024
<i>We'll take care of
the terrorist threat.</i>

00:42:19.224 --> 00:42:21.504
By bombing them
out of the galaxy?

00:42:22.144 --> 00:42:24.184
No, we'll handle this.

00:42:24.424 --> 00:42:26.464
<i>A cell of Skrulls anywhere</i>

00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:28.504
<i>is a threat to Kree everywhere.</i>

00:42:28.704 --> 00:42:29.704
<i>Where are they?</i>

00:42:29.784 --> 00:42:31.504
- They are...
- Lost.

00:42:32.664 --> 00:42:34.824
They are lost for now.

00:42:35.264 --> 00:42:36.664
But we will find them.

00:42:36.904 --> 00:42:40.384
<i>Do so, or we will.</i>

00:42:44.504 --> 00:42:46.944
Maintain the course for C-53.

00:42:56.408 --> 00:42:57.448
Hey.

00:42:59.288 --> 00:43:01.008
Thanks for covering for me.

00:43:01.168 --> 00:43:02.208
Sure.

00:43:04.968 --> 00:43:06.248
So...

00:43:06.728 --> 00:43:09.528
how long have you
been Ant-Man again?

00:43:13.328 --> 00:43:14.768
Not long.

00:43:14.928 --> 00:43:16.608
It just sort of happened.

00:43:16.768 --> 00:43:18.448
I'm sorry for lying to you...

00:43:18.608 --> 00:43:20.328
and I'm sorry for
risking everything.

00:43:20.488 --> 00:43:21.408
Daddy, it's okay.

00:43:21.568 --> 00:43:22.688
It's not.

00:43:23.728 --> 00:43:25.128
I do some dumb things...

00:43:25.288 --> 00:43:27.568
and the people that I
love the most pay the price.

00:43:27.768 --> 00:43:28.768
Mainly you.

00:43:28.928 --> 00:43:31.168
Trying to help
people isn't dumb.

00:43:33.488 --> 00:43:35.648
I screw it up just
about every time.

00:43:35.808 --> 00:43:39.008
So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back...

00:43:39.168 --> 00:43:40.408
like a partner.

00:43:40.608 --> 00:43:41.528
Well, she's made it clear

00:43:41.608 --> 00:43:42.928
that's about the
last thing she wants.

00:43:43.088 --> 00:43:44.208
Who?

00:43:44.408 --> 00:43:45.688
Hope.

00:43:48.088 --> 00:43:49.448
Wait, who did you think?

00:43:49.608 --> 00:43:50.488
Me.

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:52.048
You?

00:43:52.248 --> 00:43:53.728
Don't laugh.

00:43:54.208 --> 00:43:55.568
I'd be a great partner.

00:43:55.648 --> 00:43:57.448
Aw, peanut.

00:43:57.528 --> 00:44:01.808
Aw. You would be awesome.
And if I let you...

00:44:02.008 --> 00:44:04.208
I would be a terrible dad.

00:44:04.528 --> 00:44:05.888
Fine.

00:44:06.088 --> 00:44:08.728
Then have Hope be your partner.
She's smart.

00:44:10.408 --> 00:44:11.968
She reminds me of you.

00:44:12.648 --> 00:44:14.648
You gonna go help her?

00:44:15.008 --> 00:44:16.808
I think you should help her.

00:44:16.968 --> 00:44:18.968
I wish I could...

00:44:19.808 --> 00:44:22.688
but I don't know how I could
help her without hurting you.

00:44:26.008 --> 00:44:27.568
You can do it.

00:44:27.928 --> 00:44:29.968
You can do anything.

00:44:30.368 --> 00:44:33.208
You are the world's
greatest grandma.

00:44:41.029 --> 00:44:42.688
Agent Woo will
see you in an hour.

00:44:42.888 --> 00:44:44.808
An hour? We don't have an hour.

00:44:45.008 --> 00:44:47.248
Oh, you got
somewhere else to be?

00:44:54.928 --> 00:44:57.128
Oh, now, that's my girl.

00:45:03.608 --> 00:45:05.688
All right, what's our plan?

00:45:07.368 --> 00:45:09.048
To shrink that wall.

00:45:09.448 --> 00:45:10.448
It looks load-bearing.

00:45:10.608 --> 00:45:11.768
The ceiling could collapse.

00:45:11.928 --> 00:45:13.448
Then we run like hell.

00:45:13.608 --> 00:45:15.768
Now, I estimate 15-20
agents on the floor.

00:45:15.928 --> 00:45:17.768
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

00:45:17.928 --> 00:45:19.248
They're all heavily armed.

00:45:19.408 --> 00:45:20.528
Not great odds.

00:45:21.248 --> 00:45:22.368
You got any better ideas?

00:45:22.528 --> 00:45:23.528
Nope.

00:45:24.368 --> 00:45:26.288
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

00:45:26.648 --> 00:45:28.408
She'd be so proud of you.

00:45:33.848 --> 00:45:34.848
Okay.

00:45:36.128 --> 00:45:37.128
One...

00:45:37.848 --> 00:45:38.808
two...

00:45:44.293 --> 00:45:45.049
Scott?

00:45:45.168 --> 00:45:46.768
What're you two just
standing around for?

00:45:46.928 --> 00:45:48.408
We gotta go find that lab.

00:45:49.301 --> 00:45:50.541
What about me?

00:45:52.036 --> 00:45:52.888
Perfect.

00:45:53.048 --> 00:45:54.808
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

00:46:08.387 --> 00:46:09.747
Okay, now what?

00:46:09.968 --> 00:46:11.528
You're asking me?

00:46:14.063 --> 00:46:15.223
Get in!

00:46:20.757 --> 00:46:21.637
Hi.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.360
Hi.

00:46:25.848 --> 00:46:28.848
Uh, excuse me.
Are we planning on leaving soon...

00:46:29.008 --> 00:46:30.768
or are you two gonna
keep staring at each other...

00:46:30.928 --> 00:46:32.848
until they start shooting at us?

00:46:33.368 --> 00:46:34.768
Yeah.

00:46:39.528 --> 00:46:40.848
- Hey, Burch.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

00:46:41.008 --> 00:46:41.928
Yeah, they're out.

00:46:42.128 --> 00:46:43.448
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

00:46:48.248 --> 00:46:49.648
Her suit is missing,
and so is the van.

00:46:49.848 --> 00:46:51.008
How could this happen?

00:46:51.168 --> 00:46:52.888
I mean, what the dickens?

00:47:04.632 --> 00:47:06.427
<i>Still no word from Vision?</i>

00:47:06.587 --> 00:47:09.076
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

00:47:09.189 --> 00:47:10.907
<i>On a stolen Quinjet</i>

00:47:10.987 --> 00:47:12.787
<i>with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.</i>

00:47:13.227 --> 00:47:14.827
You know they're
only criminals because

00:47:14.907 --> 00:47:16.387
you've chosen to call
them that, right, sir?

00:47:16.587 --> 00:47:17.707
<i>My God, Rhodes.</i>

00:47:17.867 --> 00:47:21.067
<i>Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.</i>

00:47:21.227 --> 00:47:22.347
If it weren't for those Accords,

00:47:22.427 --> 00:47:23.827
Vision would've been right here.

00:47:24.587 --> 00:47:27.787
<i>I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.</i>

00:47:28.267 --> 00:47:29.307
That's right.

00:47:31.307 --> 00:47:33.107
And I'm pretty
sure I paid for that.

00:47:33.307 --> 00:47:34.507
<i>You have second thoughts?</i>

00:47:34.667 --> 00:47:36.387
Not anymore.

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:43.890
Mr. Secretary.

00:47:48.347 --> 00:47:50.027
<i>You got some nerve.</i>

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:52.307
<i>I'll give you that.</i>

00:47:52.467 --> 00:47:54.227
You could use some
of that right now.

00:47:55.067 --> 00:47:57.307
<i>The world's on fire.</i>

00:47:58.107 --> 00:48:01.187
<i>And you think all is forgiven?</i>

00:48:01.787 --> 00:48:03.667
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:05.867
And I'm way past
asking permission.

00:48:07.827 --> 00:48:09.867
Earth just lost
her best defender.

00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:11.587
So we're here to fight.

00:48:13.147 --> 00:48:15.067
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

00:48:16.067 --> 00:48:17.987
we'll fight you too.

00:48:21.587 --> 00:48:22.587
<i>Arrest them.</i>

00:48:23.387 --> 00:48:24.987
All over it.

00:48:30.067 --> 00:48:31.427
That's a court-martial.

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:35.011
It's great to see you, Cap.

00:48:36.027 --> 00:48:37.787
You too, Rhodey.

00:48:37.867 --> 00:48:38.867
Hey.

00:48:40.395 --> 00:48:42.675
Wow. You guys...

00:48:43.307 --> 00:48:45.307
really look like crap.

00:48:45.467 --> 00:48:47.067
Must've been a
rough couple years.

00:48:47.227 --> 00:48:49.907
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

00:48:50.347 --> 00:48:52.547
Uh, I think you look great.

00:48:55.867 --> 00:48:56.947
Uh...

00:48:59.627 --> 00:49:01.667
Yeah, I'm back.

00:49:03.347 --> 00:49:04.347
Hi, Bruce.

00:49:09.867 --> 00:49:10.907
Nat.

00:49:14.307 --> 00:49:15.867
This is awkward.

00:49:18.295 --> 00:49:19.855
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

00:49:20.067 --> 00:49:21.227
And they can clearly find us.

00:49:21.387 --> 00:49:23.627
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

00:49:23.907 --> 00:49:25.347
After the whole
Accords situation,

00:49:25.467 --> 00:49:26.987
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough

00:49:27.147 --> 00:49:28.707
on their families.
They're on house arrest.

00:49:28.827 --> 00:49:30.107
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:31.747
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

00:49:32.667 --> 00:49:33.707
Okay, look.

00:49:33.787 --> 00:49:36.627
Thanos has the biggest
army in the universe...

00:49:36.787 --> 00:49:40.187
and he is not gonna
stop until he gets...

00:49:42.027 --> 00:49:43.067
Vision's stone.

00:49:43.267 --> 00:49:44.507
Then we have to protect it.

00:49:44.667 --> 00:49:46.307
No, we have to destroy it.

00:49:48.467 --> 00:49:49.747
I've been giving a
good deal of thought

00:49:49.827 --> 00:49:50.827
to this entity in my head.

00:49:51.027 --> 00:49:52.507
About its nature.

00:49:53.067 --> 00:49:55.227
But also its composition.

00:49:55.387 --> 00:49:57.387
I think if it were exposed

00:49:57.467 --> 00:49:59.307
to a sufficiently
powerful energy source...

00:49:59.467 --> 00:50:03.307
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

00:50:04.907 --> 00:50:07.067
its molecular
integrity could fail.

00:50:07.627 --> 00:50:09.867
Yeah, and you with it.

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:11.787
We're not having
this conversation.

00:50:11.947 --> 00:50:13.947
Eliminating the
stone is the only way

00:50:14.027 --> 00:50:16.027
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

00:50:16.587 --> 00:50:18.787
That's too high a price.

00:50:23.307 --> 00:50:25.667
Only you have
the power to pay it.

00:50:29.947 --> 00:50:31.987
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

00:50:32.147 --> 00:50:34.667
One life cannot stand in
the way of defeating him.

00:50:34.827 --> 00:50:36.267
But it should.

00:50:38.747 --> 00:50:40.147
We don't trade lives, Vision.

00:50:40.307 --> 00:50:42.267
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

00:50:42.427 --> 00:50:44.227
to save how many
millions of people?

00:50:44.387 --> 00:50:46.427
Tell me, why is
this any different?

00:50:46.587 --> 00:50:48.907
Because you might have a choice.

00:50:50.187 --> 00:50:51.547
Your mind is made up

00:50:51.627 --> 00:50:53.987
of a complex
construct of overlays.

00:50:54.147 --> 00:50:57.747
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

00:50:57.907 --> 00:50:59.667
All of them mixed together,

00:50:59.747 --> 00:51:01.227
all of them learning
from one another.

00:51:01.627 --> 00:51:03.387
You're saying Vision
isn't just the stone?

00:51:03.547 --> 00:51:06.627
I'm saying that if we
take out the stone...

00:51:06.787 --> 00:51:08.227
there's still a whole
lot of Vision left.

00:51:08.307 --> 00:51:09.747
Perhaps the best parts.

00:51:10.098 --> 00:51:11.418
Can we do that?

00:51:12.147 --> 00:51:13.187
Not me, not here.

00:51:14.187 --> 00:51:15.707
Well, you better find someone

00:51:15.787 --> 00:51:16.987
and somewhere fast.

00:51:17.147 --> 00:51:18.507
Ross isn't just
gonna let you guys

00:51:18.587 --> 00:51:19.787
have your old rooms back.

00:51:22.867 --> 00:51:24.427
I know somewhere.

00:51:39.067 --> 00:51:40.347
The Kingsguard

00:51:40.427 --> 00:51:41.707
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

00:51:41.867 --> 00:51:43.427
And the Border Tribe?

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:45.467
Those that are left.

00:51:45.747 --> 00:51:47.867
Send word to the Jabari as well.

00:51:48.027 --> 00:51:50.147
M'Baku likes a good fight.

00:51:52.427 --> 00:51:54.147
And what of this one?

00:51:54.747 --> 00:51:56.907
This one may be tired of war.

00:51:57.227 --> 00:52:00.267
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

00:52:22.907 --> 00:52:24.507
Where's the fight?

00:52:25.427 --> 00:52:26.827
On its way.
