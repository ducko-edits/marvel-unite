WEBVTT

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:43.956
Sing it, Drax!

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:57.916
Why are we doing this again?

00:00:58.076 --> 00:00:59.716
It's a distress
signal, Rocket.

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:00.796
Someone could be dying.

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:03.036
I get that,
but why are we doing it?

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:04.996
'Cause we're nice.

00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:06.196
And maybe whoever it is

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:07.916
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.

00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:10.436
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:12.316
I mean, if he
doesn't pony up...

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:13.516
We take his ship.

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:15.356
- Exactly!
- Bingo!

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:16.436
All right!

00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:21.196
We are arriving.

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:22.636
All right, Guardians,

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:23.836
don't forget this
might be dangerous...

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:26.276
so let's put on
our mean faces.

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:33.076
Groot, put that
thing away, now.

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:34.156
I don't wanna tell you again.

00:01:34.236 --> 00:01:35.356
Groot.

00:01:35.556 --> 00:01:36.676
I am Groot!

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:37.756
- Whoa!
- Language!

00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:39.196
- Hey!
- Wow.

00:01:39.396 --> 00:01:41.036
You got some
acorns on you, kid.

00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:42.756
Ever since you
got a little sap,

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:43.836
you're a total d-hole.

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:48.076
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.

00:01:54.996 --> 00:01:56.516
What happened?

00:02:00.556 --> 00:02:01.916
Oh, my God.

00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:09.236
Looks like we're
not getting paid.

00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:13.436
Wipers! Wipers!

00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:14.916
Get it off.

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:24.356
How the hell
is this dude still alive?

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:26.316
He is not a dude.

00:02:26.476 --> 00:02:27.996
You're a dude.

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:31.396
This... This is a man.

00:02:31.756 --> 00:02:34.516
A handsome, muscular man.

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:35.676
I'm muscular.

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:36.756
But who are you
kidding, Quill?

00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:38.236
You're one sandwich
away from fat.

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:39.316
Yeah, right.

00:02:39.396 --> 00:02:40.916
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

00:02:40.996 --> 00:02:41.996
What?

00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:46.116
Gamora, do you think I'm...

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:51.996
He is anxious, angry.

00:02:52.156 --> 00:02:55.036
He feels tremendous
loss and guilt.

00:02:55.916 --> 00:02:58.676
It's like a pirate had
a baby with an angel.

00:02:58.756 --> 00:02:59.836
Wow.

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:01.796
This is a real wake-up
call for me. Okay.

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:04.676
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:05.876
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:07.316
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:08.676
It's like his muscles

00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:10.676
are made of
Cotati metal fibers.

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:12.556
Stop massaging his muscles.

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:15.356
Wake him up.

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:19.436
Wake.

00:03:37.036 --> 00:03:39.276
Who the hell are you guys?

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.582
<i>♪ There's a woman
on the outside</i>

00:04:21.676 --> 00:04:23.989
<i>♪ Looking inside,
does she see me?</i>

00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:26.364
<i>♪ No, she does not
really see me</i>

00:04:26.473 --> 00:04:28.884
<i>♪ 'Cause she sees
her own reflection</i>

00:04:29.192 --> 00:04:31.126
<i>♪ And I'm trying
not to notice</i>

00:04:31.317 --> 00:04:33.317
<i>♪ That she's hitching
up her skirt</i>

00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:36.295
<i>♪ And while she's
straightening her stockings</i>

00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:38.301
<i>♪ Her hair has
gotten wet</i>

00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:50.796
What can I get ya?

00:04:51.236 --> 00:04:52.716
Where was this
photograph taken?

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:54.756
An airport.

00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:56.156
Where's Pegasus?

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:57.916
That's classified.

00:04:58.396 --> 00:05:01.636
Not unlike the file
I started on you.

00:05:03.676 --> 00:05:05.957
But I see you've changed
it up a bit since then.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.636
Grunge is a good look for you.

00:05:07.796 --> 00:05:09.316
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:10.916
It was cool, you know?

00:05:11.116 --> 00:05:13.876
Had a space invasion,
big car chase.

00:05:14.076 --> 00:05:17.516
Got to watch an alien autopsy.

00:05:18.116 --> 00:05:19.556
Typical nine-to-five.

00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:20.756
So you saw one?

00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:23.636
I was never one
to believe in aliens...

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:26.556
but I can't unsee that.

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:29.356
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask.

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:31.836
You think I'm one of those
green things.

00:05:31.996 --> 00:05:33.276
Can't be too careful.

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:38.196
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.

00:05:38.396 --> 00:05:39.676
I'm afraid
I'm gonna need proof.

00:05:39.836 --> 00:05:41.796
We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?

00:05:41.956 --> 00:05:43.676
No. The DNA would match.

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:44.916
Want my AOL password?

00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:47.076
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:49.196
- of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.

00:05:50.396 --> 00:05:51.876
You wanna get personal.

00:05:52.316 --> 00:05:53.996
- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.

00:05:54.196 --> 00:05:55.556
But technically,
I don't remember that part.

00:05:55.716 --> 00:05:57.156
- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snoofers.

00:05:57.316 --> 00:05:58.596
- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said.

00:05:58.676 --> 00:05:59.676
Do I pass?

00:05:59.756 --> 00:06:01.116
Not yet. First job?

00:06:01.276 --> 00:06:03.036
Soldier.
Straight out of high school.

00:06:03.116 --> 00:06:04.276
Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.

00:06:04.436 --> 00:06:05.476
- Then?
- Spy.

00:06:05.636 --> 00:06:06.716
- Where?
- It was the Cold War.

00:06:06.836 --> 00:06:07.956
We were everywhere.

00:06:08.116 --> 00:06:10.796
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.

00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:12.436
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.

00:06:12.636 --> 00:06:13.756
- Now?
- Been riding a desk

00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:14.836
for the past six years...

00:06:14.956 --> 00:06:15.996
trying to figure out where our

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:17.076
future enemies
are coming from.

00:06:17.156 --> 00:06:18.316
Never occurred to me

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:20.676
they would be coming
from above.

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:22.156
Name a detail so bizarre

00:06:22.236 --> 00:06:23.556
a Skrull could never
fabricate it.

00:06:26.076 --> 00:06:29.636
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.

00:06:31.556 --> 00:06:32.996
You didn't need that, did you?

00:06:33.196 --> 00:06:34.836
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

00:06:35.476 --> 00:06:37.116
Okay. Your turn.

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:38.956
Prove you're not a Skrull.

00:07:16.764 --> 00:07:20.518
<i>How long has the
Kree-Skrull war been going on?</i>

00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:22.937
- Thousands of years.
- Thousands of years.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.399
And yet still the Skrull
plague is ever present.

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:30.486
One of you could be a Skrull
and we wouldn't know it.

00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:33.239
Is it you?

00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:35.700
Are you a Skrull?
What about you?

00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:37.743
You sure you're not a Skrull?

00:07:39.495 --> 00:07:43.791
As the strongest remaining empire,
we proudly defend not just ourselves,

00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:47.169
but every nation
too weak to fight. We...

00:07:47.253 --> 00:07:49.046
How do we know
you're not a Skrull, Commander?

00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:56.679
There's no greater example
of Kree potential

00:07:56.762 --> 00:07:58.681
than the mighty Vers.

00:08:03.894 --> 00:08:05.396
The commander's right about the Skrulls.

00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:07.231
They took everything from me.

00:08:07.314 --> 00:08:11.193
My home, my family,
 my memory.

00:08:12.862 --> 00:08:16.657
Our leader, the Supreme Intelligence,
saved me, gave me purpose

00:08:16.741 --> 00:08:18.075
and this implant,

00:08:20.328 --> 00:08:22.747
so I can fight back.

00:08:22.872 --> 00:08:24.540
- Did it hurt?
- No.

00:08:24.623 --> 00:08:26.334
What's the Supreme Intelligence like?

00:08:26.417 --> 00:08:27.585
So vast

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:31.547
our minds can't even comprehend
its true image.

00:08:32.548 --> 00:08:34.842
So when we commune
with the Supreme Intelligence,

00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:37.970
it appears to each of us
as a unique virtual form,

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:43.017
as the person we respect
and admire above all others.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.143
So you see yourself, huh?

00:08:45.936 --> 00:08:47.396
Who do you see?

00:08:49.315 --> 00:08:50.399
Everyone back to work.

00:08:54.506 --> 00:08:55.506
I slipped.

00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:56.746
Right, you slipped

00:08:56.826 --> 00:08:58.466
as a result of me
punching you in the face.

00:08:58.586 --> 00:08:59.586
I was already slipping

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:00.706
when you happened
to punch me in the face.

00:09:00.786 --> 00:09:02.306
The two events
were not related.

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:11.869
You have to let go
of the past.

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:13.189
I don't remember my past.

00:09:13.349 --> 00:09:14.869
It's causing you doubt,

00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:16.709
and doubt
makes you vulnerable.

00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:25.949
Control it.

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:32.799
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:36.919
<i>Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel...</i>

00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:38.919
<i>we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.</i>

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.279
<i>We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.</i>

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:44.636
- We good?
- Yeah.

00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:46.356
I'll be right back.

00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:55.996
- Can I have one of these?
- No.

00:10:10.236 --> 00:10:13.436
Ah. Susan!
Welcome to <i>Oui!</i>

00:10:13.596 --> 00:10:15.236
Sonny!

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:17.236
<i>Oui</i> is French
for "yes."

00:10:17.396 --> 00:10:19.556
As in "yes" to farm-to-table,
"yes" to locally sourced...

00:10:19.716 --> 00:10:22.316
and "yes" to planet
before profit.

00:10:23.476 --> 00:10:25.076
Well, let's hope
it also means "yes"

00:10:25.156 --> 00:10:26.796
to "Do you have the component
I ordered?"

00:10:29.196 --> 00:10:31.436
You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:32.676
Have a seat.

00:10:32.836 --> 00:10:33.716
No, I'm good. Thank you.

00:10:33.876 --> 00:10:35.156
Who is this guy?

00:10:35.316 --> 00:10:38.356
Sonny Burch. He traffics
in black market technology.

00:10:38.956 --> 00:10:41.076
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

00:10:43.436 --> 00:10:44.716
Could I just have one...

00:10:44.876 --> 00:10:45.876
No.

00:10:46.716 --> 00:10:49.956
You know, I have
a special friend at the FBI.

00:10:50.036 --> 00:10:51.236
And I say "special"...

00:10:51.396 --> 00:10:54.196
because, well,
he tells me things

00:10:54.276 --> 00:10:55.916
that I didn't previously know.

00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:58.196
For example...

00:10:58.356 --> 00:11:00.156
your name isn't Susan.

00:11:00.316 --> 00:11:02.556
It's Hope Van Dyne.

00:11:03.076 --> 00:11:05.996
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

00:11:06.156 --> 00:11:08.276
- That's not good, Hank.
- No shit.

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:17.876
What do you want?

00:11:18.036 --> 00:11:20.196
Relationships
are built on trust, Hope.

00:11:20.396 --> 00:11:22.796
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:24.036
Our relationship?

00:11:24.196 --> 00:11:26.956
My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.

00:11:27.116 --> 00:11:28.916
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA
don't even exist anymore...

00:11:29.076 --> 00:11:30.996
but now, Hank Pym...

00:11:31.196 --> 00:11:33.516
Hank Pym
is a real opportunity.

00:11:33.676 --> 00:11:34.756
Do you have a point?

00:11:34.916 --> 00:11:36.116
Oh, you think
that I don't know

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.556
what you've been building
with all this?

00:11:38.716 --> 00:11:40.716
Quantum technology.

00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:43.756
Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget AI,

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.036
forget cryptocurrency.

00:11:45.196 --> 00:11:46.796
Quantum energy is the future.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.636
It's the next gold rush.

00:11:48.836 --> 00:11:49.796
Is that so?

00:11:49.956 --> 00:11:51.356
I want in, Hope.

00:11:51.516 --> 00:11:53.996
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...

00:11:54.156 --> 00:11:56.236
of arranging some buyers
for your lab.

00:11:56.876 --> 00:11:57.996
Starting bid...

00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:01.756
one billion dollars.

00:12:01.916 --> 00:12:03.516
Thank you, Sonny, really.

00:12:03.676 --> 00:12:04.876
But my father and I
have something

00:12:04.956 --> 00:12:07.396
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

00:12:07.556 --> 00:12:10.676
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:13.036
My buyers don't take no
for an answer.

00:12:14.476 --> 00:12:15.956
So, we are
either in business together...

00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:18.916
or we aren't
in business together.

00:12:21.796 --> 00:12:23.756
Then I guess we aren't.

00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:25.756
You can go.

00:12:26.236 --> 00:12:28.676
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

00:12:29.036 --> 00:12:31.796
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

00:12:32.396 --> 00:12:33.916
Listen, Sonny.

00:12:34.076 --> 00:12:36.836
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

00:12:36.916 --> 00:12:38.436
if you just give me
that component.

00:12:38.636 --> 00:12:40.476
Darlin', the only thing
you're takin' from here...

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:44.276
is my heart,
but it will mend in time.

00:12:45.916 --> 00:12:47.076
Okay.

00:12:55.556 --> 00:12:56.996
So, now what?

00:12:57.196 --> 00:12:58.276
You'll see.

00:12:59.196 --> 00:13:00.916
She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.

00:13:01.116 --> 00:13:02.196
- Mmm-hmm.
- I want to know what it is

00:13:02.276 --> 00:13:03.356
because if they're not working
with us...

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:04.996
they're working with somebody.
So find out.

00:13:05.156 --> 00:13:06.276
I want some names...

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.716
Hold on, you gave her wings?

00:13:19.116 --> 00:13:19.956
Get her.

00:13:36.156 --> 00:13:37.876
Not my turn-of-the-century
chandelier!

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:44.076
Stop firing! Stop!

00:13:48.636 --> 00:13:50.156
All right, take this.
Go. Go, go, go!

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:51.756
Go!

00:14:54.316 --> 00:14:55.916
Wings and blasters.

00:14:56.076 --> 00:14:57.956
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.

00:14:58.116 --> 00:14:58.956
No, I did.

00:15:01.036 --> 00:15:03.396
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

00:15:03.556 --> 00:15:06.076
Oh, our business
isn't finished yet, Hope.

00:15:06.276 --> 00:15:07.876
I can assure you of that!

00:15:15.316 --> 00:15:17.196
What in the hell is that?

00:15:31.076 --> 00:15:32.516
Dad, are you seeing this?

00:15:32.636 --> 00:15:33.596
Hope, get out of there!

00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:43.876
- I gotta do something.
- Wait!

00:15:49.516 --> 00:15:52.516
It is still a
work in progress.

00:16:11.156 --> 00:16:12.276
You taught me
that kick. Remember?

00:16:12.476 --> 00:16:13.636
Yeah, great form.

00:16:13.836 --> 00:16:15.596
Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?

00:16:15.756 --> 00:16:16.876
Not the time, Scott.

00:16:17.396 --> 00:16:18.396
Damn it, where'd it go?

00:16:21.396 --> 00:16:22.396
I've lost it.

00:16:22.516 --> 00:16:24.276
<i>I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.</i>

00:16:24.396 --> 00:16:26.156
<i>Try looking...</i>

00:16:26.516 --> 00:16:27.356
Dad?

00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:37.596
Give me that.

00:16:37.676 --> 00:16:38.636
Now.

00:16:42.916 --> 00:16:44.396
- Are you okay?
- No!

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:45.596
He got the lab.

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:46.516
No.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:47.756
Come on!

00:16:52.537 --> 00:16:54.297
<i>One hundred twenty days</i>

00:16:54.377 --> 00:16:56.257
<i>since the last Skrull attack.</i>

00:16:56.417 --> 00:16:57.737
<i>Has anyone ever seen</i>

00:16:57.817 --> 00:16:59.457
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?

00:16:59.617 --> 00:17:02.257
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence

00:17:02.337 --> 00:17:03.657
in its true form.

00:17:04.537 --> 00:17:05.977
You know that.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:09.297
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

00:17:09.457 --> 00:17:12.737
So it's sacred. It's personal.

00:17:12.897 --> 00:17:14.737
No Kree divulges it, ever.

00:17:15.057 --> 00:17:16.057
Who do you see?

00:17:17.097 --> 00:17:18.097
- Your brother?
- No.

00:17:18.257 --> 00:17:19.457
- Father?
- No.

00:17:19.617 --> 00:17:21.657
- Your old commander?
- Vers.

00:17:21.817 --> 00:17:23.057
It's me you see, isn't it?

00:17:24.497 --> 00:17:25.897
I see what you're
trying to do.

00:17:26.057 --> 00:17:27.497
- Is it working?
- Yes.

00:17:27.657 --> 00:17:29.337
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

00:17:29.497 --> 00:17:31.817
What is the point of
giving me these...

00:17:31.977 --> 00:17:33.697
if you don't want me
to use them?

00:17:33.857 --> 00:17:35.537
I want you to use them.

00:17:35.697 --> 00:17:37.417
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...

00:17:37.577 --> 00:17:39.377
of showing you
how to use them.

00:17:39.537 --> 00:17:40.537
I know how.

00:17:40.617 --> 00:17:41.657
Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to

00:17:41.737 --> 00:17:42.777
knock me down without them.

00:17:44.297 --> 00:17:46.497
Control your impulses.

00:17:47.577 --> 00:17:49.937
Stop using this,
start using this.

00:17:50.697 --> 00:17:54.697
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

00:18:35.737 --> 00:18:36.897
Vers.

00:18:37.857 --> 00:18:39.497
Intelligence.

00:18:39.857 --> 00:18:42.777
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

00:18:42.937 --> 00:18:43.977
I am.

00:18:44.537 --> 00:18:47.497
You struggle
with your emotions...

00:18:48.017 --> 00:18:50.497
with your past,
which fuels them.

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:55.257
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...

00:18:55.417 --> 00:18:58.497
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.

00:18:58.657 --> 00:19:01.577
Imposters who silently infiltrate...

00:19:01.737 --> 00:19:03.737
then take over our planets.

00:19:05.537 --> 00:19:07.217
Horrors that you remember...

00:19:07.377 --> 00:19:09.937
and so much that you do not.

00:19:13.657 --> 00:19:17.257
It's all blank.
My life.

00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:18.977
You're supposed
to take the form

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:20.737
of who I most admire...

00:19:20.897 --> 00:19:25.257
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:27.457
Perhaps this is a mercy

00:19:27.537 --> 00:19:29.857
sparing you
from a deeper pain.

00:19:30.457 --> 00:19:33.337
Freeing you to do
what all Kree must...

00:19:34.337 --> 00:19:36.657
put your people's needs
before your own.

00:19:36.937 --> 00:19:39.217
We've given you a great gift.

00:19:39.377 --> 00:19:41.897
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.

00:19:43.377 --> 00:19:44.497
I want to serve.

00:19:44.697 --> 00:19:46.617
Then master yourself.

00:19:46.777 --> 00:19:49.377
What was given
can be taken away.

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:54.817
I won't let you down.

00:19:54.977 --> 00:19:57.017
We'll know soon enough.

00:19:57.657 --> 00:19:59.097
You have a mission.

00:20:00.537 --> 00:20:02.937
Serve well, and with honor.

00:20:06.857 --> 00:20:07.977
What was that?

00:20:08.217 --> 00:20:09.457
I don't know.

00:20:09.617 --> 00:20:11.457
But we need to find
somewhere to regroup

00:20:11.537 --> 00:20:13.377
and figure out
where the lab is.

00:20:14.137 --> 00:20:15.337
So, where to now?

00:20:15.697 --> 00:20:17.337
How about my house? Hmm?

00:20:17.497 --> 00:20:18.577
I'm supposed
to be there anyway,

00:20:18.657 --> 00:20:19.697
and Woo could walk in
any second.

00:20:19.897 --> 00:20:22.097
Exactly why we're not going
to your house.

00:20:22.257 --> 00:20:23.457
What about your house?

00:20:24.617 --> 00:20:26.337
Sorry.

00:20:26.497 --> 00:20:29.217
Well, there is one place
I can think of.

00:20:30.137 --> 00:20:31.137
No.

00:20:31.577 --> 00:20:34.017
No, no, no, no!

00:20:35.897 --> 00:20:36.777
No!

00:20:40.137 --> 00:20:41.337
Wow, Dr. Pym...

00:20:41.537 --> 00:20:42.857
who would've thought that,

00:20:42.937 --> 00:20:44.217
once again,
in your hour of need...

00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:46.417
that you would turn to us,
you know?

00:20:46.617 --> 00:20:47.537
Not me.

00:20:48.017 --> 00:20:49.897
Mmm. Help yourself.

00:20:50.057 --> 00:20:51.217
Hey, what's up
with the fancy pastry?

00:20:51.337 --> 00:20:52.697
We gotta keep
the food budget down.

00:20:52.817 --> 00:20:54.577
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

00:20:54.777 --> 00:20:55.817
The oatmeal packets.

00:20:55.937 --> 00:20:57.537
Oatmeal packets.

00:20:57.697 --> 00:20:59.297
- It's insult.
- Why is it an insult?

00:20:59.457 --> 00:21:00.537
Because it tastes like sand.

00:21:00.617 --> 00:21:01.977
You know why?
'Cause it's organic.

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:03.337
It's not organic, it's sand.

00:21:03.417 --> 00:21:04.617
It's the most important
meal of the day.

00:21:04.777 --> 00:21:05.577
You know what,
you can get creative with it.

00:21:05.657 --> 00:21:06.697
Break teeth.

00:21:06.777 --> 00:21:08.017
Put a little brown sugar on it.
You can put some cinnamon.

00:21:08.177 --> 00:21:09.177
Put a little honey.
Whatever you want...

00:21:09.377 --> 00:21:12.257
Guys, guys, guys.
Come on, man.

00:21:12.417 --> 00:21:14.057
We got bigger fish to fry.

00:21:14.257 --> 00:21:15.697
Is that my desk?

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:17.417
- Yeah.
- What?

00:21:17.657 --> 00:21:19.017
Why do I have
such a small desk?

00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:20.657
Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

00:21:20.817 --> 00:21:21.817
You snooze, you lose.

00:21:22.017 --> 00:21:22.817
Well, I was
under house arrest.

00:21:22.897 --> 00:21:23.657
Yeah.

00:21:23.737 --> 00:21:24.897
You know what,
this isn't even a desk.

00:21:25.057 --> 00:21:25.897
This is garbage.

00:21:26.057 --> 00:21:28.697
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

00:21:28.817 --> 00:21:30.017
I got it at a rummage sale.

00:21:30.217 --> 00:21:31.657
So, you save money
on my desk?

00:21:31.817 --> 00:21:32.697
Guys.

00:21:32.897 --> 00:21:34.937
Hope, please,
we need to focus, all right?

00:21:35.097 --> 00:21:37.297
We gotta find
that lab already. Jeez.

00:21:38.457 --> 00:21:39.817
Oh, you know what?
I heard stories,

00:21:39.897 --> 00:21:40.817
like what happened to you.

00:21:41.057 --> 00:21:43.057
This crazy, creepy cat, who
walks through walls and stuff.

00:21:43.217 --> 00:21:44.937
Like a ghost.

00:21:45.097 --> 00:21:46.577
Like Baba Yaga.

00:21:49.657 --> 00:21:52.217
Baba Yaga, the witch.

00:21:52.337 --> 00:21:55.097
They tell stories to children
to frighten them.

00:21:56.337 --> 00:21:57.697
You know Baba Yaga?

00:21:58.737 --> 00:22:00.097
Whoever stole it...

00:22:00.297 --> 00:22:01.697
we need to find it.

00:22:01.857 --> 00:22:05.297
Oh, you don't find someone
like that. They find you.

00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:07.217
Like Baba Yaga.

00:22:07.737 --> 00:22:10.097
Dr. Pym, you're the
smartest genius I know.

00:22:10.217 --> 00:22:12.617
Didn't you put some kind of
LoJack on your lab?

00:22:12.817 --> 00:22:13.897
Because if you didn't,

00:22:13.977 --> 00:22:15.937
we have a variety
of affordable options.

00:22:16.137 --> 00:22:19.497
Of course I did, Luis.
It was disabled.

00:22:19.617 --> 00:22:22.137
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

00:22:22.337 --> 00:22:24.257
They also looked like
they were phasing.

00:22:24.457 --> 00:22:25.457
Phasing?

00:22:25.617 --> 00:22:27.177
Quantum phasing.
When an object moves

00:22:27.257 --> 00:22:28.497
through different states
of matter.

00:22:28.857 --> 00:22:30.497
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

00:22:30.617 --> 00:22:31.737
The lab emits radiation.

00:22:31.897 --> 00:22:34.457
Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?

00:22:34.617 --> 00:22:37.217
That could work, yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.

00:22:37.377 --> 00:22:39.337
Where else can we find
that equipment?

00:22:41.337 --> 00:22:43.097
Well, there is one person.

00:22:44.257 --> 00:22:45.497
Bill Foster.

00:22:45.657 --> 00:22:46.657
Great!

00:22:46.857 --> 00:22:48.217
Who's Bill Foster?

00:22:48.417 --> 00:22:50.497
He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:22:50.657 --> 00:22:52.377
They had a falling out
years ago.

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:54.217
You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.

00:22:54.417 --> 00:22:56.417
It's probably
just a waste of time.

00:22:56.537 --> 00:22:58.537
Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.

00:22:58.657 --> 00:22:59.897
Don't you think
we should check?

00:23:00.137 --> 00:23:02.377
We need to find out
who took the lab.

00:24:12.047 --> 00:24:13.447
This can't be good.

00:24:13.607 --> 00:24:15.447
Must be another Skrull attack.

00:24:15.647 --> 00:24:17.087
Whatever it is, it's big.

00:24:18.127 --> 00:24:19.327
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

00:24:19.487 --> 00:24:20.527
Once.

00:24:20.687 --> 00:24:22.887
- It was deeply disturbing.
- Why?

00:24:23.167 --> 00:24:25.247
Because I stared into
the face of my mortal enemy...

00:24:25.407 --> 00:24:27.287
and the face staring back
was my own.

00:24:27.727 --> 00:24:28.887
Maybe if you were
more attractive,

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.327
then it would be
less disturbing.

00:24:30.487 --> 00:24:32.447
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.

00:24:32.647 --> 00:24:33.767
You never laugh.

00:24:33.927 --> 00:24:36.407
I laugh on the inside.

00:24:37.007 --> 00:24:38.087
I'm not doing that now.

00:24:38.247 --> 00:24:39.407
It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,

00:24:39.487 --> 00:24:40.567
you're quite handsome.

00:24:40.727 --> 00:24:41.807
Well, thank you.

00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:44.047
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.

00:24:44.487 --> 00:24:45.527
All right.

00:24:46.207 --> 00:24:48.367
Prepare for...

00:24:49.367 --> 00:24:52.047
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

00:24:52.287 --> 00:24:55.447
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

00:24:55.607 --> 00:24:57.407
This time, Torfa.

00:24:57.567 --> 00:24:58.567
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

00:24:58.727 --> 00:25:02.087
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.

00:25:03.887 --> 00:25:05.447
The Skrull general, Talos,

00:25:05.527 --> 00:25:07.207
has sent kill units
to find him.

00:25:07.367 --> 00:25:08.927
Should they reach him
before we do...

00:25:09.087 --> 00:25:10.247
the intelligence he's acquired

00:25:10.327 --> 00:25:12.047
over three years
is as good as theirs.

00:25:13.407 --> 00:25:14.887
The Accusers will bomb

00:25:14.967 --> 00:25:16.927
a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.

00:25:17.087 --> 00:25:19.847
We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...

00:25:20.447 --> 00:25:23.447
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.

00:25:23.607 --> 00:25:25.167
The Torfan populace.

00:25:25.927 --> 00:25:27.247
We are not to interfere
with them,

00:25:27.327 --> 00:25:28.367
nor them with us.

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:31.807
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

00:25:31.967 --> 00:25:33.647
Proceed with caution.

00:25:33.967 --> 00:25:36.207
Follow protocol
before extracting him.

00:25:37.847 --> 00:25:39.367
This is a dangerous mission.

00:25:39.527 --> 00:25:42.367
We must all be ready
to join the Collective

00:25:42.447 --> 00:25:43.887
if that is our fate today.

00:25:44.047 --> 00:25:45.047
For the good of all Kree.

00:25:45.207 --> 00:25:46.207
For the good of all Kree!

00:26:56.447 --> 00:26:58.927
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

00:26:59.127 --> 00:27:01.727
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.

00:27:20.727 --> 00:27:22.087
Locals on the periphery.

00:27:22.967 --> 00:27:24.167
Maybe a dozen.

00:27:24.447 --> 00:27:25.767
Minn-Erva?

00:27:27.447 --> 00:27:30.047
Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?

00:27:30.967 --> 00:27:31.967
Repeat.

00:27:45.727 --> 00:27:47.567
His beacon's coming from
that temple. Let's move.

00:27:48.207 --> 00:27:50.527
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.

00:27:50.687 --> 00:27:51.807
Only one way in,
only one way out.

00:27:52.007 --> 00:27:53.487
We can get past the locals.

00:27:53.647 --> 00:27:56.247
We don't know if they are locals.
Too risky.

00:27:56.407 --> 00:27:57.487
You don't have to go with me.
I'll go alone.

00:27:57.647 --> 00:27:58.687
No, you won't.

00:28:03.687 --> 00:28:05.687
Right. We keep a close radius.

00:28:05.847 --> 00:28:07.887
We lose comms,
we meet back at the <i>Helion.</i>

00:28:08.967 --> 00:28:10.167
Come on.

00:28:22.407 --> 00:28:23.767
Att-Lass, you getting this?

00:28:23.927 --> 00:28:25.327
Copy. I see them.

00:28:35.447 --> 00:28:36.527
Get back!

00:28:37.247 --> 00:28:38.247
Commander?

00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:48.087
Get back! Back!

00:28:48.767 --> 00:28:51.487
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?

00:28:52.607 --> 00:28:54.127
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:56.527
Does anybody copy?

00:29:00.647 --> 00:29:01.967
I don't wanna hurt you.

00:29:04.687 --> 00:29:05.767
Keep back!

00:29:09.287 --> 00:29:10.287
Stay back!

00:29:14.447 --> 00:29:16.847
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.

00:29:17.007 --> 00:29:18.607
They're just starving.

00:29:44.207 --> 00:29:45.687
HGX-78.

00:29:45.847 --> 00:29:48.607
TRT79-VVX6.

00:29:51.247 --> 00:29:53.127
Get back.

00:30:01.407 --> 00:30:02.407
Skrulls!

00:30:20.087 --> 00:30:21.087
Vers!

00:30:21.287 --> 00:30:23.367
<i>Vers? Skrulls.</i>

00:30:23.527 --> 00:30:25.367
<i>It's an ambush.</i>

00:30:44.327 --> 00:30:45.367
Incoming!

00:30:50.647 --> 00:30:52.007
Back to the <i>Helion.</i>

00:30:52.367 --> 00:30:53.567
<i>Vers. Do you copy?</i>

00:30:54.287 --> 00:30:56.127
<i>Back to the</i> Helion.

00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:57.447
<i>Come in. Vers.</i>

00:30:57.607 --> 00:30:59.247
How did you know the code?

00:31:00.007 --> 00:31:02.327
How about
I tell you my secret...

00:31:03.967 --> 00:31:06.367
when you've told me yours?

00:31:09.905 --> 00:31:11.425
<i>Let's open her up.</i>

00:31:17.889 --> 00:31:20.089
<i>Where are we?</i>

00:31:20.249 --> 00:31:21.649
<i>Stand by.</i>

00:31:24.928 --> 00:31:26.568
<i>Go back even further.</i>

00:31:27.303 --> 00:31:29.810
<i>That's right! Fonzie's never
lost a Holitacker yet.</i>

00:31:30.709 --> 00:31:32.474
<i>Yeah, and we got the
home planet advantage.</i>

00:31:32.506 --> 00:31:34.826
<i>Am I the only one
that's confused here?</i>

00:31:34.873 --> 00:31:36.497
<i>Just count to three,
then, specimen.</i>

00:31:36.842 --> 00:31:38.685
<i>Can you do this?
Eep!</i>

00:31:38.772 --> 00:31:40.212
<i>This can't be right.</i>

00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:46.224
<i>Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?</i>

00:31:50.014 --> 00:31:51.294
<i>I think</i>
<i>we went back too far.</i>

00:31:53.186 --> 00:31:54.546
<i>Let me try something.</i>

00:32:03.405 --> 00:32:06.605
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

00:32:06.765 --> 00:32:09.725
and the sun and the stars
in the sky.

00:32:09.885 --> 00:32:10.925
And so,

00:32:11.005 --> 00:32:12.765
little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.

00:32:13.405 --> 00:32:15.645
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

00:32:17.233 --> 00:32:19.313
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.

00:32:19.513 --> 00:32:21.673
Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.

00:32:21.833 --> 00:32:22.953
<i>Charming memory.</i>

00:32:23.113 --> 00:32:24.113
<i>Hang on.</i>

00:32:24.365 --> 00:32:25.765
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:29.599
<i>Dr. Wendy Lawson.
That's her.</i>

00:32:30.178 --> 00:32:31.498
<i>Do we have
her location?</i>

00:32:32.412 --> 00:32:33.013
<i>Hold on.</i>

00:32:34.263 --> 00:32:37.023
<i>Go back right before this.
Go back.</i>

00:32:38.865 --> 00:32:41.225
<i>Now let me see
where you're headed.</i>

00:32:41.506 --> 00:32:43.706
<i>That's right.
Look at the coordinates.</i>

00:32:44.386 --> 00:32:45.786
<i>Focus.</i>

00:32:47.546 --> 00:32:48.986
<i>Open, please.</i>

00:32:50.108 --> 00:32:51.388
<i>Focus!</i>

00:33:11.336 --> 00:33:14.736
Do we have any information
we can act on?

00:33:15.536 --> 00:33:18.136
Just that Lawson was
somewhere on planet C-53.

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:19.867
We're on our way.

00:33:19.987 --> 00:33:21.747
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

00:33:22.733 --> 00:33:25.933
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

00:33:27.425 --> 00:33:28.745
And everything we're after.

00:33:36.477 --> 00:33:37.477
Oh!

00:33:38.437 --> 00:33:39.637
That did something.

00:33:39.797 --> 00:33:41.117
Try that again.

00:33:52.717 --> 00:33:53.757
Not yet!

00:34:03.277 --> 00:34:04.677
What did you do to me?

00:34:05.397 --> 00:34:07.197
Now we're just after
a little information.

00:34:07.357 --> 00:34:08.837
What did you put in my head?

00:34:08.997 --> 00:34:10.877
Nothing that wasn't
already there.

00:34:12.557 --> 00:34:13.837
But those aren't my memories.

00:34:13.997 --> 00:34:16.517
Yeah, it's like a bad trip,
isn't it?

00:34:16.677 --> 00:34:18.877
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.

00:34:19.037 --> 00:34:21.117
They really did
a number on you.

00:34:21.317 --> 00:34:22.357
Enough of your mind games.

00:34:22.517 --> 00:34:23.997
What do you want?

00:34:26.117 --> 00:34:28.557
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...

00:34:28.717 --> 00:34:30.277
and her light-speed engine.

00:34:30.437 --> 00:34:32.117
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

00:34:32.277 --> 00:34:35.837
Really?
Then why is she in your head?

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:40.877
Guys,
it's not a good idea

00:34:40.957 --> 00:34:42.397
to be out in the open
like this.

00:34:42.557 --> 00:34:45.397
Relax, no one's
gonna recognize us.

00:34:45.717 --> 00:34:47.917
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

00:34:48.117 --> 00:34:49.557
That's not a disguise, Hank.

00:34:49.637 --> 00:34:51.837
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

00:34:52.037 --> 00:34:53.917
<i>In an isolated system...</i>

00:34:54.077 --> 00:34:58.597
particles co-exist in
a stable phase relationship.

00:34:58.797 --> 00:35:00.957
If the system
is interfered with,

00:35:01.037 --> 00:35:04.237
that stability becomes chaos.

00:35:04.357 --> 00:35:06.197
Unpredictable.

00:35:06.357 --> 00:35:08.757
Dangerous.
Beautiful.

00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:11.277
Isolated completely,
a quantum system

00:35:11.357 --> 00:35:13.717
would revert back to
separate states of matter...

00:35:13.877 --> 00:35:17.517
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

00:35:17.637 --> 00:35:20.237
In other words,
the object in question

00:35:20.317 --> 00:35:21.957
would be both
in and out of phase...

00:35:22.117 --> 00:35:25.357
with multiple
parallel realities.

00:35:30.157 --> 00:35:33.917
Speaking of being
out of phase with reality.

00:35:34.037 --> 00:35:36.797
I am noticing an
unusually high number

00:35:36.877 --> 00:35:39.197
of glazed eyes out there
among you.

00:35:40.397 --> 00:35:43.237
So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?

00:35:43.397 --> 00:35:44.557
That'll be enough for today.

00:35:44.637 --> 00:35:46.397
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.

00:35:48.397 --> 00:35:51.157
It's incredible.
You're linked to Janet.

00:35:51.917 --> 00:35:54.277
It's quantum entanglement
between the quantum states of

00:35:54.357 --> 00:35:56.157
Posner molecules
in your brains.

00:35:56.397 --> 00:35:57.757
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

00:35:59.077 --> 00:35:59.917
Do you guys just
put the word "quantum"

00:35:59.997 --> 00:36:00.877
in front of everything?

00:36:01.037 --> 00:36:02.757
Doctor, we need to
find our lab.

00:36:02.917 --> 00:36:04.317
Hope, I'd love to help you...

00:36:04.517 --> 00:36:05.077
but I don't have anything

00:36:05.197 --> 00:36:05.917
like the equipment
you're describing.

00:36:06.077 --> 00:36:08.197
I told you this is a waste
of time. Come on, let's go.

00:36:08.317 --> 00:36:09.437
Don't condescend, Hank.

00:36:09.637 --> 00:36:11.637
You're the one who's
on the run from the FBI.

00:36:11.797 --> 00:36:13.637
All because you
had to grow to a size

00:36:13.717 --> 00:36:15.437
that finally fit your ego.

00:36:15.597 --> 00:36:18.957
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

00:36:19.117 --> 00:36:19.997
Really?

00:36:21.597 --> 00:36:23.677
Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.

00:36:23.877 --> 00:36:26.117
I slept for three days straight.
You have no idea.

00:36:26.237 --> 00:36:27.357
Actually, I do.

00:36:27.477 --> 00:36:29.237
Back in the day,
I was Hank's partner

00:36:29.317 --> 00:36:31.077
on a project called Goliath.

00:36:31.237 --> 00:36:32.637
Excuse me?
You were my partner?

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:34.717
The only thing more tiring
than going that big

00:36:34.797 --> 00:36:36.717
is putting up
with Hank's bullshit.

00:36:36.877 --> 00:36:38.197
Right...

00:36:39.757 --> 00:36:42.477
I don't know.
How big did you get?

00:36:42.757 --> 00:36:45.397
My record?
21 feet.

00:36:45.517 --> 00:36:46.957
- Not bad.
- You?

00:36:47.237 --> 00:36:47.957
I don't...

00:36:48.157 --> 00:36:49.117
No, really, I'm curious.

00:36:50.077 --> 00:36:51.757
- 65 feet. Yeah.
- Whoa!

00:36:51.957 --> 00:36:53.597
- Huge.
- 65.

00:36:53.757 --> 00:36:56.157
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...

00:36:56.277 --> 00:36:58.477
we need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

00:36:58.637 --> 00:37:01.637
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?

00:37:01.757 --> 00:37:03.477
Strange.

00:37:03.637 --> 00:37:05.397
You had all the answers
back in the day.

00:37:05.517 --> 00:37:06.773
That's why I left the project.

00:37:06.945 --> 00:37:09.037
Left?
I fired you.

00:37:09.157 --> 00:37:10.357
Best decision
I ever made.

00:37:10.517 --> 00:37:12.677
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental...

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.877
stubborn, impatient.

00:37:15.037 --> 00:37:16.997
Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.

00:37:17.157 --> 00:37:18.557
Just the mediocrities.

00:37:18.677 --> 00:37:20.757
Janet was the only one
who could endure him

00:37:20.837 --> 00:37:21.917
and chose to stick it out.

00:37:22.037 --> 00:37:22.997
Watch it, Bill.

00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:24.597
She paid the price,
though, didn't she?

00:37:24.757 --> 00:37:25.877
You son of a bitch.

00:37:25.997 --> 00:37:28.237
I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.

00:37:28.397 --> 00:37:29.797
I'm trying to save my mother.

00:37:31.397 --> 00:37:32.797
Now, which office
would you say?

00:37:32.997 --> 00:37:33.797
Oh, it's Woo.

00:37:34.677 --> 00:37:36.197
Someone must have seen me.

00:37:36.317 --> 00:37:37.557
Relax. If this is about you,

00:37:37.637 --> 00:37:39.437
they'd be in
your house by now.

00:37:42.037 --> 00:37:43.037
What are you, 15?

00:37:43.197 --> 00:37:44.237
Come on.
We gotta go right now.

00:37:44.317 --> 00:37:47.397
Wait. You might be able to
improvise that tracker...

00:37:47.877 --> 00:37:48.997
if you modify
the diffraction units

00:37:49.077 --> 00:37:50.157
on one of your regulators.

00:37:50.637 --> 00:37:52.637
- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.

00:37:52.797 --> 00:37:54.797
Thank you. Thank you.

00:38:06.037 --> 00:38:07.677
But, Doctor,
campus police says

00:38:07.757 --> 00:38:09.557
they ID'd both Pym
and Van Dyne.

00:38:09.677 --> 00:38:10.997
I don't know
what to tell you, Agent.

00:38:11.077 --> 00:38:13.037
I haven't talked to Hank
in 30 years.

00:38:13.197 --> 00:38:14.277
I can assure you
I'm the last person

00:38:14.357 --> 00:38:15.397
he would want to visit.

00:38:15.557 --> 00:38:16.637
Oh, come on,
you expect us to...

00:38:16.717 --> 00:38:17.317
Hey, hey.

00:38:18.077 --> 00:38:19.077
Why is that?

00:38:19.677 --> 00:38:22.557
Simple.
We hate each other's guts.

00:38:23.397 --> 00:38:24.917
So I'm a terrible partner?

00:38:25.077 --> 00:38:27.437
Foster, he hasn't had
one good idea

00:38:27.517 --> 00:38:28.717
in his unremarkable career.

00:38:28.917 --> 00:38:30.837
But his idea about the
diffractors could work, right?

00:38:31.037 --> 00:38:32.797
Fine, one decent idea.

00:38:32.957 --> 00:38:34.837
Except, I eliminated
the diffractors

00:38:34.917 --> 00:38:36.797
when I upgraded the suits.

00:38:39.277 --> 00:38:41.437
So, if we had an old suit,

00:38:41.517 --> 00:38:43.597
we might be able
to track down the lab?

00:38:43.757 --> 00:38:45.077
Yes, but we don't.

00:38:47.477 --> 00:38:49.197
- What if we did?
- What do you mean?

00:38:50.597 --> 00:38:51.717
I mean...

00:38:52.917 --> 00:38:53.957
life's funny.

00:38:54.077 --> 00:38:56.077
Oh, my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.

00:38:56.237 --> 00:38:57.117
What?

00:38:57.237 --> 00:38:59.477
Well, it was
your life's work, Hank.

00:38:59.677 --> 00:39:01.117
I couldn't destroy that.

00:39:02.517 --> 00:39:03.677
Before I turned myself in,

00:39:03.757 --> 00:39:04.957
I shrunk it down
and mailed it to Luis.

00:39:05.117 --> 00:39:07.437
You sent my suit
through the mail?

00:39:07.877 --> 00:39:09.597
Hey, the postal service
is very reliable.

00:39:09.757 --> 00:39:12.997
You know, they do tracking
numbers now. Like UPS.

00:39:13.197 --> 00:39:14.197
Where is it?

00:39:14.357 --> 00:39:16.757
It's in a very safe place,
all right? Don't worry.

00:39:16.957 --> 00:39:19.637
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:21.117
What do you mean it's not
there? Where could it be?

00:39:21.317 --> 00:39:22.717
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

00:39:22.797 --> 00:39:24.077
Hey, get away from the plant.

00:39:24.237 --> 00:39:26.197
But I put it back
after Cassie and I...

00:39:27.397 --> 00:39:28.877
Show-and-tell.

00:39:28.997 --> 00:39:29.997
Scotty?

00:39:32.117 --> 00:39:33.117
No, stop!

00:39:33.757 --> 00:39:35.997
Well, the good news is
I know where it is.

00:39:42.477 --> 00:39:43.637
Whenever you go
back to school...

00:39:43.837 --> 00:39:45.517
isn't everything supposed to
look so much smaller?

00:39:45.717 --> 00:39:47.157
This place seems huge.

00:39:47.237 --> 00:39:48.357
<i>What is it?</i>

00:39:48.437 --> 00:39:49.517
It's the new regulator.

00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:51.557
Hank, what's going on
with this suit?

00:39:51.637 --> 00:39:53.277
How much of
a work in progress is this?

00:39:54.797 --> 00:39:57.917
Uh-oh.
No, no, no.

00:40:06.277 --> 00:40:07.277
Oh.

00:40:10.157 --> 00:40:12.117
What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just...

00:40:12.317 --> 00:40:13.757
Okay, okay.

00:40:17.197 --> 00:40:18.197
<i>What do you see?</i>

00:40:18.317 --> 00:40:20.437
The sizing coils
are malfunctioning.

00:40:20.557 --> 00:40:21.917
Just let me...

00:40:22.077 --> 00:40:23.797
Ow!

00:40:25.677 --> 00:40:26.757
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

00:40:29.397 --> 00:40:31.757
Okay.
All right.

00:40:32.317 --> 00:40:33.677
Try that.

00:40:37.717 --> 00:40:38.837
Sorry.

00:40:39.957 --> 00:40:40.837
What?

00:40:44.717 --> 00:40:45.677
Awesome.

00:40:45.837 --> 00:40:47.797
If only Cap could see you now.

00:40:47.957 --> 00:40:49.957
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?

00:41:00.797 --> 00:41:02.197
Hey!

00:41:02.357 --> 00:41:03.477
Where's your hall pass?

00:41:05.477 --> 00:41:06.957
Hey, I'm talking to you.

00:41:08.677 --> 00:41:09.677
Hey!

00:41:11.077 --> 00:41:12.677
Hey. Eh...

00:41:37.317 --> 00:41:39.237
You can do it.

00:41:39.397 --> 00:41:41.477
You almost got it.

00:41:53.637 --> 00:41:55.397
Oh, peanut.

00:42:07.917 --> 00:42:09.357
Okay, let's go.

00:42:25.357 --> 00:42:27.557
Hiya, champ,
how was school today?

00:42:28.797 --> 00:42:31.077
All right, get your jokes out now.
Can you fix the suit?

00:42:31.277 --> 00:42:32.677
So cranky.

00:42:32.877 --> 00:42:35.437
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

00:42:35.517 --> 00:42:37.557
Do you really have that?

00:42:47.117 --> 00:42:48.797
Let's see if
Foster was right.

00:43:02.157 --> 00:43:03.757
This has gotta be the lab.

00:43:07.637 --> 00:43:08.717
Let's go get it.

00:43:09.197 --> 00:43:10.077
Yeah.

00:43:19.357 --> 00:43:20.837
This seems right.

00:43:22.277 --> 00:43:25.197
Look at us, teaming up
twice in one day.

00:43:25.357 --> 00:43:26.837
Makes you think, huh?

00:43:26.997 --> 00:43:28.037
About what?

00:43:28.197 --> 00:43:29.877
Germany.

00:43:30.037 --> 00:43:30.917
What do you mean?

00:43:31.077 --> 00:43:33.757
We were working together,
training together...

00:43:33.917 --> 00:43:36.397
and other stuffing together.

00:43:36.917 --> 00:43:38.877
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

00:43:39.037 --> 00:43:40.597
I guess we'll never know.

00:43:40.757 --> 00:43:42.317
But I do know one thing.

00:43:42.477 --> 00:43:43.397
What?

00:43:43.557 --> 00:43:46.317
If I had, you'd have
never been caught.

00:43:54.037 --> 00:43:55.477
Hey, Scott.

00:43:55.637 --> 00:43:57.917
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

00:43:57.997 --> 00:43:59.477
long enough to get my lab?

00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:01.477
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

00:44:06.917 --> 00:44:08.677
Okay, you're transmitting.

00:44:08.837 --> 00:44:09.917
What took you so long?

00:44:10.077 --> 00:44:12.477
Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.

00:44:12.637 --> 00:44:14.917
I'm thinking
Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

00:44:15.357 --> 00:44:16.397
You like it?

00:44:16.557 --> 00:44:17.717
Hilarious.

00:44:18.877 --> 00:44:20.517
<i>I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.</i>

00:44:20.677 --> 00:44:22.837
There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.

00:44:23.117 --> 00:44:23.957
<i>Be careful.</i>

00:44:24.117 --> 00:44:25.637
You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful... Whoa!

00:44:27.117 --> 00:44:28.517
It's okay.
It's just the suit.

00:44:28.677 --> 00:44:30.277
- How do you know?
- Look.

00:44:33.797 --> 00:44:35.237
That's Ghost?

00:44:35.397 --> 00:44:36.677
What is she doing?

00:44:36.877 --> 00:44:37.957
Do you think
that suit is how

00:44:38.037 --> 00:44:39.837
she goes through walls
and stuff?

00:44:40.157 --> 00:44:41.877
Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.

00:44:42.037 --> 00:44:44.197
Hope, look!
There's the lab.

00:44:49.877 --> 00:44:51.877
Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

00:44:51.957 --> 00:44:52.917
and not somebody
else's, right?

00:44:53.077 --> 00:44:55.197
Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.

00:44:56.557 --> 00:44:57.437
I'll get it.

00:44:59.037 --> 00:45:00.517
Oh, shit...

00:45:03.154 --> 00:45:06.714
Then why is she in your head?

00:45:35.658 --> 00:45:36.698
You guys wouldn't
happen to know

00:45:36.778 --> 00:45:37.818
how these things come off,
would ya?

00:45:38.418 --> 00:45:39.418
No?

00:45:39.578 --> 00:45:40.858
Fine.

00:46:03.698 --> 00:46:04.698
Hmm.

00:47:12.658 --> 00:47:13.658
Hey.

00:47:35.643 --> 00:47:36.923
You leaving so soon?

00:47:37.923 --> 00:47:39.363
We're just getting to know
each other.

00:48:36.268 --> 00:48:38.828
And how is that
supposed to prove to me

00:48:38.908 --> 00:48:40.108
you're not a Skrull?

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:49.710
That's a photon blast.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.150
And?

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:52.230
A Skrull can't do that.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.510
So, a full bird colonel

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:55.710
turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:58.350
must have pretty high
security clearance.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:59.990
Where's Pegasus?

00:49:13.103 --> 00:49:15.543
Hope. Hope!
Hank.

00:49:15.983 --> 00:49:17.463
Guys.

00:49:17.623 --> 00:49:19.823
I don't think
they can hear you.

00:49:22.383 --> 00:49:23.663
Hi.

00:49:24.303 --> 00:49:25.783
I'm Ava.

00:49:26.143 --> 00:49:27.423
Scott.

00:49:29.823 --> 00:49:31.423
So, you don't need the suit...

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:35.303
to go through things.

00:49:35.943 --> 00:49:37.103
No.

00:49:37.423 --> 00:49:40.983
It just helps me control it.

00:49:42.503 --> 00:49:46.223
And the pain, supposedly.

00:49:50.703 --> 00:49:52.063
You're not gonna reach
into my chest

00:49:52.143 --> 00:49:53.463
and crush my heart, are you?

00:49:57.143 --> 00:49:58.663
You're funny.

00:50:01.583 --> 00:50:04.543
I'm not gonna hurt you,
Scott, unless I have to.

00:50:07.223 --> 00:50:08.983
I need...

00:50:10.143 --> 00:50:12.143
what's in your head.

00:50:26.223 --> 00:50:27.503
Let's wake up
the rest of the gang

00:50:27.583 --> 00:50:28.823
and get this over with,
shall we?

00:50:31.823 --> 00:50:32.863
Get up!

00:50:33.663 --> 00:50:34.663
Come on!

00:50:37.463 --> 00:50:38.543
Dad?

00:50:40.823 --> 00:50:42.783
Don't ever touch him again.

00:50:42.983 --> 00:50:44.343
Now, now, Hope...

00:50:45.383 --> 00:50:46.943
I think I'm being rather
gentle with your father,

00:50:47.023 --> 00:50:48.223
all things considered.

00:50:49.303 --> 00:50:50.943
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:50:51.863 --> 00:50:55.143
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

00:50:56.543 --> 00:50:57.503
Bill.

00:50:59.063 --> 00:51:00.703
What have you done?

00:51:00.983 --> 00:51:03.703
It's what you've
done, Dr. Pym.

00:51:04.143 --> 00:51:05.583
You're with her?

00:51:05.743 --> 00:51:07.983
Oh, man.
I thought you were cool.

00:51:08.143 --> 00:51:09.743
What the hell
is going on here?

00:51:10.143 --> 00:51:12.383
I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.

00:51:13.543 --> 00:51:14.823
Why would he?

00:51:14.983 --> 00:51:17.103
Elihas Starr.

00:51:17.983 --> 00:51:20.423
They were colleagues
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:51:20.583 --> 00:51:21.903
Quantum research.

00:51:22.743 --> 00:51:26.663
Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

00:51:27.103 --> 00:51:28.503
You had him fired.

00:51:28.663 --> 00:51:30.783
Oh, and discredited
for good measure.

00:51:34.103 --> 00:51:38.223
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

00:51:39.503 --> 00:51:42.503
Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.

00:51:42.663 --> 00:51:43.663
No, no, no!

00:51:44.703 --> 00:51:45.703
Too many.

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:48.863
<i>Until something went wrong.</i>

00:51:49.863 --> 00:51:51.383
He told us to run.

00:51:51.543 --> 00:51:52.383
Elihas, what's happening?

00:51:52.543 --> 00:51:53.943
Just go. Go!

00:51:54.143 --> 00:51:56.343
Daddy! Daddy!

00:51:56.503 --> 00:51:57.783
<i>I could tell
he was scared.</i>

00:52:03.383 --> 00:52:04.223
Daddy!

00:52:04.383 --> 00:52:05.463
Ava, no!

00:52:08.703 --> 00:52:10.503
<i>I didn't want him
to be alone.</i>

00:52:11.983 --> 00:52:13.263
No! No!

00:52:21.023 --> 00:52:23.263
<i>When I woke up,
my parents were dead.</i>

00:52:25.943 --> 00:52:27.743
<i>I wasn't so lucky.</i>

00:52:32.543 --> 00:52:35.543
<i>They call it
"molecular disequilibrium."</i>

00:52:36.623 --> 00:52:38.583
<i>A rather dull name, I think.</i>

00:52:38.743 --> 00:52:41.623
<i>Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.</i>

00:52:42.183 --> 00:52:45.903
Every cell in my body
is torn apart...

00:52:46.063 --> 00:52:47.583
and stitched back together.

00:52:48.503 --> 00:52:50.103
Over and over.

00:52:50.263 --> 00:52:51.903
Every day.

00:52:53.383 --> 00:52:55.303
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D.
when I got the call

00:52:55.383 --> 00:52:58.103
about a quantum anomaly
in Argentina.

00:53:01.343 --> 00:53:02.263
Hello, Ava.

00:53:03.903 --> 00:53:05.023
My name's Bill.

00:53:05.783 --> 00:53:07.663
I was a friend
of your father's.

00:53:09.823 --> 00:53:11.103
I brought you something.

00:53:15.623 --> 00:53:17.783
It's all right.
Try again.

00:53:19.343 --> 00:53:20.583
That's it.

00:53:20.943 --> 00:53:23.623
<i>Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.</i>

00:53:24.303 --> 00:53:25.783
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:53:25.863 --> 00:53:28.503
saw an opportunity
in my affliction.

00:53:31.743 --> 00:53:33.343
<i>They built me
a containment suit,</i>

00:53:33.423 --> 00:53:34.983
<i>so I could control my phasing.</i>

00:53:35.783 --> 00:53:37.463
<i>And trained me
to be a stealth operative.</i>

00:53:38.903 --> 00:53:39.863
<i>They weaponized me.</i>

00:53:41.223 --> 00:53:42.783
<i>I stole for them.
Spied for them.</i>

00:53:44.463 --> 00:53:45.903
<i>Killed for them.</i>

00:53:46.383 --> 00:53:48.503
And in exchange for my soul...

00:53:48.783 --> 00:53:50.543
they were going to cure me.

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:55.623
They lied.

00:53:56.583 --> 00:53:59.183
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.

00:53:59.543 --> 00:54:01.343
I built the chamber
to slow her decay,

00:54:01.423 --> 00:54:02.583
but her condition
was progressive.

00:54:02.743 --> 00:54:04.383
I didn't know how to cure it.

00:54:05.543 --> 00:54:08.223
She wanted to kill you, Hank,
but I told her no...

00:54:08.383 --> 00:54:09.583
and that she should
watch you instead.

00:54:09.743 --> 00:54:11.223
And sure enough,
she discovered

00:54:11.303 --> 00:54:12.543
that you were
building the tunnel.

00:54:14.943 --> 00:54:16.703
Then, she told me about Lang.

00:54:16.863 --> 00:54:19.303
And the message from Janet
inside his head,

00:54:19.383 --> 00:54:20.783
that's when I...

00:54:20.943 --> 00:54:21.943
Christ's sake!

00:54:22.103 --> 00:54:23.463
That's me. I'm sorry.

00:54:23.583 --> 00:54:25.143
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

00:54:26.223 --> 00:54:27.903
"Cassie, 911."

00:54:28.063 --> 00:54:29.983
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

00:54:30.143 --> 00:54:31.423
No, that's not happening.

00:54:31.583 --> 00:54:33.463
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

00:54:33.623 --> 00:54:35.263
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

00:54:35.463 --> 00:54:37.423
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

00:54:38.663 --> 00:54:40.223
Okay, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

00:54:40.383 --> 00:54:43.183
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

00:54:45.743 --> 00:54:47.543
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

00:54:47.703 --> 00:54:49.423
<i>I can't find my soccer shoes.</i>

00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:50.543
What?

00:54:50.703 --> 00:54:51.783
<i>I have a game tomorrow.</i>

00:54:51.983 --> 00:54:53.023
<i>Hey, Scott,
I know that they're there.</i>

00:54:53.183 --> 00:54:54.543
<i>Can you just walk the phone
around the house?</i>

00:54:54.703 --> 00:54:56.103
No, I can't do that right now.

00:54:56.263 --> 00:54:58.023
<i>- Why not?</i>
- Because I'm sick.

00:54:58.183 --> 00:54:59.223
<i>Hey, can you just
maybe look around</i>

00:54:59.303 --> 00:55:00.223
<i>later then and call me back?</i>

00:55:00.383 --> 00:55:01.743
<i>Please? Thank you.</i>

00:55:01.903 --> 00:55:03.103
<i>Bye, Daddy!</i>

00:55:03.263 --> 00:55:05.023
- Bye, peanut!
<i>- Feel better!</i>

00:55:05.183 --> 00:55:06.183
<i>Feel better, buddy!</i>

00:55:06.543 --> 00:55:09.063
I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

00:55:09.383 --> 00:55:11.063
Ava, I want to help you.

00:55:11.223 --> 00:55:13.223
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

00:55:13.423 --> 00:55:14.623
Oh, really? How?

00:55:14.783 --> 00:55:15.783
Janet.

00:55:15.983 --> 00:55:17.423
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

00:55:17.503 --> 00:55:18.503
absorbing quantum energy.

00:55:18.663 --> 00:55:20.023
We can extract that energy.

00:55:20.223 --> 00:55:22.503
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

00:55:22.663 --> 00:55:23.503
Extract it?

00:55:23.663 --> 00:55:24.743
- Yes.
- Are you insane?

00:55:24.903 --> 00:55:26.503
That would rip Janet apart.

00:55:26.663 --> 00:55:29.503
You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

00:55:29.663 --> 00:55:30.943
When Janet's location

00:55:31.063 --> 00:55:32.383
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

00:55:32.543 --> 00:55:34.343
or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.

00:55:34.503 --> 00:55:35.183
What?

00:55:35.343 --> 00:55:37.103
You are gonna
stay here...

00:55:37.263 --> 00:55:39.263
just in case I need your help.

00:55:40.223 --> 00:55:41.583
Like hell I would help you!

00:55:41.783 --> 00:55:42.943
You'll do whatever I say.

00:55:43.103 --> 00:55:44.143
You're gonna kill Janet!

00:55:44.303 --> 00:55:46.143
I'd be more worried
about yourself, Hank.

00:55:46.303 --> 00:55:48.783
Goddamn it, Bill!

00:55:49.223 --> 00:55:50.703
- Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.

00:55:51.303 --> 00:55:52.583
So help me God...

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:54.263
The pills.

00:55:54.463 --> 00:55:55.943
It's his heart!
He needs his pills.

00:55:56.103 --> 00:55:58.983
Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

00:56:00.303 --> 00:56:01.743
He could die!

00:56:01.903 --> 00:56:02.943
Come on!

00:56:03.103 --> 00:56:03.943
Help him!

00:56:04.383 --> 00:56:05.703
Dad, just hang on,
all right?

00:56:05.783 --> 00:56:07.103
Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:08.543
Help him, man! Come on!

00:56:08.703 --> 00:56:09.583
The Altoid tin!

00:56:11.863 --> 00:56:12.743
Wait!

00:56:17.023 --> 00:56:18.023
Thanks, guys.

00:56:18.943 --> 00:56:19.983
Hank!

00:56:45.479 --> 00:56:49.119
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

00:56:49.279 --> 00:56:50.999
To bring balance
to the universe

00:56:51.079 --> 00:56:53.239
by wiping out
half of all life.

00:56:54.159 --> 00:56:56.359
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

00:56:56.439 --> 00:56:57.839
massacre by massacre.

00:56:58.119 --> 00:56:59.519
Including my own.

00:56:59.679 --> 00:57:01.239
If he gets all
six Infinity Stones...

00:57:01.439 --> 00:57:03.639
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

00:57:04.639 --> 00:57:07.239
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

00:57:07.399 --> 00:57:11.199
Gamora is the
daughter of Thanos.

00:57:15.239 --> 00:57:17.319
Your father killed my brother.

00:57:17.639 --> 00:57:18.839
Oh, boy.

00:57:19.039 --> 00:57:20.679
Stepfather, technically.

00:57:20.839 --> 00:57:22.759
And she hates him
as much as you do.

00:57:26.479 --> 00:57:28.039
Families can be tough.

00:57:28.199 --> 00:57:29.519
Before my father died,

00:57:29.639 --> 00:57:31.359
he told me that
I had a half-sister...

00:57:31.519 --> 00:57:33.799
that he imprisoned in Hel.

00:57:33.959 --> 00:57:36.919
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

00:57:37.079 --> 00:57:38.359
So I had to kill her.

00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:40.599
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

00:57:40.679 --> 00:57:41.919
Goes round and round and...

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:43.759
I feel your pain.

00:57:43.919 --> 00:57:46.199
I feel your pain as well,
because...

00:57:46.399 --> 00:57:47.559
I mean,
it's not a competition,

00:57:47.639 --> 00:57:48.759
but I've been through a lot.

00:57:48.919 --> 00:57:50.599
My father killed my mother.

00:57:50.759 --> 00:57:51.879
And then I had to
kill my father.

00:57:51.959 --> 00:57:53.479
That was hard.

00:57:53.639 --> 00:57:56.519
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

00:57:57.079 --> 00:57:59.959
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

00:58:00.119 --> 00:58:01.799
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

00:58:03.639 --> 00:58:06.759
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

00:58:07.279 --> 00:58:09.839
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:13.279
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

00:58:14.759 --> 00:58:15.799
No, you're not.

00:58:17.919 --> 00:58:21.799
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

00:58:22.279 --> 00:58:25.679
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

00:58:27.599 --> 00:58:29.239
- No.
- You are.

00:58:29.399 --> 00:58:32.079
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

00:58:32.279 --> 00:58:33.439
No, I'm not.

00:58:33.599 --> 00:58:35.639
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

00:58:41.799 --> 00:58:42.799
Are you mocking me?

00:58:43.279 --> 00:58:46.199
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

00:58:46.679 --> 00:58:47.679
He's trying to copy me.

00:58:47.799 --> 00:58:48.759
I need you to stop doing that.

00:58:48.959 --> 00:58:50.559
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.

00:58:50.759 --> 00:58:52.119
We need to stop Thanos.

00:58:52.279 --> 00:58:53.839
Which means
we need to find out

00:58:53.919 --> 00:58:54.919
where he's going next.

00:58:55.079 --> 00:58:56.319
Knowhere.

00:58:56.479 --> 00:58:58.159
He must be going somewhere.

00:58:58.319 --> 00:59:00.319
No, no. Knowhere?

00:59:00.519 --> 00:59:03.159
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

00:59:03.319 --> 00:59:05.759
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

00:59:06.159 --> 00:59:09.359
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

00:59:09.519 --> 00:59:10.679
Because for years...

00:59:10.839 --> 00:59:12.999
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

00:59:13.079 --> 00:59:14.519
with a man
called the Collector.

00:59:14.679 --> 00:59:16.279
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

00:59:16.439 --> 00:59:18.159
Only an idiot would
give that man a stone.

00:59:18.319 --> 00:59:19.679
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...

00:59:19.839 --> 00:59:22.399
he's not going for
one of the other stones?

00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:24.959
There are six stones
out there.

00:59:25.119 --> 00:59:27.319
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

00:59:27.479 --> 00:59:30.759
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

00:59:31.239 --> 00:59:33.279
He stole the Space
Stone from me...

00:59:33.439 --> 00:59:36.119
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

00:59:36.279 --> 00:59:37.919
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

00:59:37.999 --> 00:59:38.999
They're with the Avengers.

00:59:39.319 --> 00:59:41.599
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

00:59:41.759 --> 00:59:42.879
Like Kevin Bacon?

00:59:43.039 --> 00:59:44.319
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

00:59:44.439 --> 00:59:45.399
I haven't been there
in a while.

00:59:45.599 --> 00:59:47.799
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

00:59:47.959 --> 00:59:49.599
No one even knows where it is.

00:59:49.759 --> 00:59:51.519
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

00:59:51.599 --> 00:59:53.039
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

00:59:53.239 --> 00:59:55.639
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

00:59:55.799 --> 00:59:56.839
You're welcome.

00:59:56.999 --> 00:59:58.239
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

00:59:58.399 --> 01:00:02.079
Wrong. Where we have
to go is Nidavellir.

01:00:02.519 --> 01:00:04.359
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:07.599
Nidavellir is real?
Seriously?

01:00:07.759 --> 01:00:09.399
That place is a legend.

01:00:09.559 --> 01:00:10.999
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

01:00:11.079 --> 01:00:13.119
to ever torment the universe.

01:00:13.279 --> 01:00:15.319
I would very much like
to go there, please.

01:00:15.479 --> 01:00:16.479
The rabbit is correct

01:00:16.559 --> 01:00:17.639
and clearly the smartest
among you.

01:00:17.719 --> 01:00:18.759
Rabbit?

01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:21.159
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

01:00:21.319 --> 01:00:22.519
I assume you're
the captain, sir.

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:23.719
You're very perceptive.

01:00:23.879 --> 01:00:25.079
You seem like a noble leader.

01:00:25.159 --> 01:00:26.759
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

01:00:26.919 --> 01:00:29.719
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

01:00:29.879 --> 01:00:31.639
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

01:00:31.799 --> 01:00:32.919
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

01:00:32.999 --> 01:00:33.999
Quiet.

01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:35.679
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:37.479
Look, this is my ship.

01:00:37.639 --> 01:00:39.399
And I'm not goin' to...

01:00:40.399 --> 01:00:42.479
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:43.879
The Thanos-killing kind.

01:00:44.719 --> 01:00:46.239
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

01:00:46.399 --> 01:00:48.439
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

01:00:48.599 --> 01:00:49.679
Your bodies would crumble

01:00:49.759 --> 01:00:50.959
as your minds
collapsed into madness.

01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:53.039
Is it weird that I wanna
do it even more now?

01:00:53.199 --> 01:00:54.359
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

01:00:54.519 --> 01:00:55.799
If we don't go to Knowhere

01:00:55.879 --> 01:00:57.439
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

01:00:57.639 --> 01:00:59.159
he'll be too powerful to stop.

01:00:59.319 --> 01:01:01.479
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

01:01:01.679 --> 01:01:03.359
We got two ships

01:01:03.439 --> 01:01:04.839
and a large assortment
of morons.

01:01:04.999 --> 01:01:08.239
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

01:01:08.439 --> 01:01:09.599
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

01:01:09.679 --> 01:01:11.239
to try to stop Thanos.

01:01:11.439 --> 01:01:13.359
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

01:01:13.519 --> 01:01:14.799
For the record...

01:01:15.559 --> 01:01:16.879
I know that
you're going with him

01:01:16.959 --> 01:01:18.039
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:19.719
You know, you really shouldn't

01:01:19.799 --> 01:01:21.919
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:24.239
Come on, Groot.

01:01:24.759 --> 01:01:27.479
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

01:01:31.184 --> 01:01:34.024
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

01:01:34.199 --> 01:01:35.319
Bye.
