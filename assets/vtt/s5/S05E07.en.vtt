00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:17.638
I used to be a
respected scientist.

00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:20.798
I had my name on
the sides of buildings.

00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:22.318
Now, I got this.

00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:26.038
Well, you wanted a
smaller quantum tunnel.

00:00:26.198 --> 00:00:28.798
This is... smaller.

00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:33.518
Oh. Sorry.
My bad.

00:00:33.638 --> 00:00:35.518
Ah, I think it has flair.

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:38.918
All right.
Control's online.

00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:44.438
The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.

00:00:44.638 --> 00:00:46.438
It should automatically
start absorbing

00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:47.798
quantum healing particles.

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:50.918
Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:52.438
They're cute,
but they'll eat you.

00:00:52.558 --> 00:00:54.558
And don't get sucked
into a time vortex.

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:55.798
We won't be able to save you.

00:00:58.918 --> 00:01:00.198
Okay.

00:01:01.278 --> 00:01:02.678
Going subatomic in five...

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:04.958
four...

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:06.438
three...

00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:07.958
two...

00:01:08.198 --> 00:01:09.038
one.

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:15.278
All right, Scott,
this is a mic check.

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:22.318
<i>Mic check, one, two. One, two.</i>

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:24.958
<i>How's everybody doing
tonight in the quantum realm?</i>

00:01:25.238 --> 00:01:26.278
Scott, we read you.

00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:28.038
I just wanna make sure.

00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:34.638
Okay.

00:01:34.798 --> 00:01:37.558
Healing particles secured
for our new Ghost friend.

00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:38.678
<i>Great.</i>

00:01:38.878 --> 00:01:40.478
<i>Preparing for re-entry in...</i>

00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:43.238
<i>five, four, three...</i>

00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:48.118
Hello?

00:01:49.238 --> 00:01:51.198
Ha, ha. Very funny.

00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:52.718
Hank, quit screwing around.

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:55.238
You told me yourself
not to screw around.

00:01:56.078 --> 00:01:57.078
<i>Hank?</i>

00:01:58.638 --> 00:01:59.758
<i>Hope?</i>

00:02:00.398 --> 00:02:01.398
<i>Janet.</i>

00:02:02.598 --> 00:02:03.598
<i>Guys.</i>

00:02:04.838 --> 00:02:06.398
<i>Guys.</i>

00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:08.478
<i>Okay, seriously,
don't joke around.</i>

00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:09.758
<i>Bring me up, let's go.</i>

00:02:10.238 --> 00:02:10.878
<i>Guys!</i>

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:14.902
<i>Still no word from Stark?</i>

00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:16.342
<i>No, not yet.</i>

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:17.782
<i>We're watching every satellite</i>

00:02:17.862 --> 00:02:19.742
<i>on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.</i>

00:02:19.822 --> 00:02:21.782
What is it?

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:24.302
Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

00:02:24.462 --> 00:02:26.382
Same energy
signature as New York?

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:27.862
Ten times bigger.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:30.502
Tell Klein we'll meet him at...

00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:31.622
Nick! Nick!

00:02:45.262 --> 00:02:46.582
They okay?

00:02:47.582 --> 00:02:49.302
There's no one here.

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:00.382
Call Control.

00:03:01.142 --> 00:03:02.422
Code red.

00:03:03.102 --> 00:03:04.102
Nick.

00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:06.742
Hill.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:22.862
Oh, no.

00:03:24.502 --> 00:03:25.462
Mother...

00:04:00.664 --> 00:04:02.344
This is a nightmare.

00:04:04.064 --> 00:04:06.264
I've had better nightmares.

00:04:08.424 --> 00:04:09.464
Hey.

00:04:10.544 --> 00:04:12.664
So, that thing just stopped

00:04:12.744 --> 00:04:14.424
doing whatever
the hell it was doing.

00:04:16.344 --> 00:04:18.144
What do we got?

00:04:19.064 --> 00:04:21.344
Whatever signal it was
sending finally crapped out.

00:04:21.584 --> 00:04:22.624
I thought we
bypassed the battery.

00:04:22.704 --> 00:04:23.704
We did.

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:26.704
It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.

00:04:27.624 --> 00:04:29.384
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

00:04:29.544 --> 00:04:30.944
We don't even know what this is.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.504
Fury did.
Just do it, please.

00:04:33.784 --> 00:04:36.304
You tell me the second
you get a signal.

00:04:36.464 --> 00:04:38.944
I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.

00:04:41.904 --> 00:04:43.304
Where's Fury?

00:05:28.207 --> 00:05:29.287
You don't need to do that.

00:05:29.752 --> 00:05:32.432
Because, uh, you're
just holding the position.

00:05:33.617 --> 00:05:34.857
Oh, yeah.

00:05:35.172 --> 00:05:37.012
That was close.

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:39.536
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:41.167
I would like to try again.

00:05:43.732 --> 00:05:46.012
We're tied up. Feel the tension?

00:05:46.086 --> 00:05:47.606
It's fun.

00:05:47.703 --> 00:05:49.743
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

00:05:51.085 --> 00:05:52.085
And you've won.

00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:54.021
Congratulations.

00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:55.341
Fair game.

00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:58.021
Good sport.

00:05:59.294 --> 00:06:00.694
You have fun?

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.407
It was fun.

00:06:26.937 --> 00:06:28.457
This thing on?

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:32.719
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:36.761
If you find this recording...

00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:39.681
don't post it on social media.

00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:41.481
It's gonna be a real tearjerker.

00:06:42.121 --> 00:06:44.561
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.

00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:46.761
I don't even know
if you're still...

00:06:47.321 --> 00:06:49.161
Oh, God, I hope so.

00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:52.281
<i>Today's day 21.</i>

00:06:52.441 --> 00:06:54.681
<i>No, uh, 22.</i>

00:06:55.361 --> 00:06:57.881
<i>You know, if it wasn't
for the existential terror...</i>

00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:00.241
<i>of staring into the
literal void of space,</i>

00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:02.521
<i>I'd say I'm feeling
a little better today.</i>

00:07:02.681 --> 00:07:04.121
<i>Infection's run its course,</i>

00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:05.721
<i>thanks to the Blue
Meanie back there.</i>

00:07:06.103 --> 00:07:07.703
<i>Oh, you'd love her.</i>

00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:09.481
<i>Very practical.</i>

00:07:09.961 --> 00:07:12.041
<i>Only a tiny bit sadistic.</i>

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:19.201
<i>So, the fuel cells were
cracked during battle...</i>

00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:21.481
<i>and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...</i>

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:24.361
<i>and bought ourselves
about 48 hours of flight time.</i>

00:07:27.721 --> 00:07:29.481
<i>Uh, but it's now
dead in the water.</i>

00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:33.161
<i>Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.</i>

00:07:34.516 --> 00:07:36.876
<i>Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...</i>

00:07:38.521 --> 00:07:40.201
<i>and that'll be it.</i>

00:07:43.481 --> 00:07:46.561
<i>Pep, I know I said
no more surprises...</i>

00:07:46.721 --> 00:07:48.441
<i>but I gotta say I
was really hoping</i>

00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:50.321
<i>to pull off one last one.</i>

00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:52.441
<i>But it looks like...</i>

00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:54.401
<i>Well, you know
what it looks like.</i>

00:07:55.768 --> 00:07:57.608
Don't feel bad about this.

00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:00.568
I mean, actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

00:08:01.288 --> 00:08:04.448
and then move on
with enormous guilt...

00:08:09.568 --> 00:08:11.568
I should probably
lie down for a minute.

00:08:11.648 --> 00:08:13.608
Go rest my eyes.

00:08:16.608 --> 00:08:18.168
Please know...

00:08:19.368 --> 00:08:22.928
when I drift off, it'll be
like every night lately.

00:08:23.168 --> 00:08:26.128
I'm fine. Totally fine.

00:08:26.768 --> 00:08:28.088
I dream about you.

00:08:29.648 --> 00:08:31.248
Because it's always you.

00:11:54.008 --> 00:11:55.008
Couldn't stop him.

00:11:55.168 --> 00:11:56.168
Neither could I.

00:11:56.328 --> 00:11:57.488
Hang on.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.488
I lost the kid.

00:12:04.048 --> 00:12:05.648
Tony, we lost.

00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:08.928
Is, uh...?

00:12:09.928 --> 00:12:11.568
- Oh, good.
- Oh, my God!

00:12:12.568 --> 00:12:14.208
Oh, my God!

00:12:19.008 --> 00:12:20.728
It's okay.

00:12:27.128 --> 00:12:29.448
It's been 23 days since
Thanos came to Earth.

00:12:31.772 --> 00:12:34.052
World governments are in pieces.

00:12:34.528 --> 00:12:36.208
The parts that
are still working...

00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:40.208
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

00:12:42.968 --> 00:12:44.528
He did exactly what he
said he was gonna do.

00:12:44.728 --> 00:12:45.808
Thanos wiped out...

00:12:48.288 --> 00:12:51.368
...50% of all living creatures.

00:12:55.728 --> 00:12:57.648
Where is he now?
Where?

00:12:57.808 --> 00:12:59.528
We don't know.

00:12:59.688 --> 00:13:02.768
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

00:13:05.408 --> 00:13:06.448
What's wrong with him?

00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:09.339
Oh, he's pissed.

00:13:09.648 --> 00:13:11.008
He thinks he failed.

00:13:12.448 --> 00:13:13.528
Which, of course, he did...

00:13:13.608 --> 00:13:15.728
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

00:13:15.888 --> 00:13:17.328
Honestly, until
this exact second

00:13:17.408 --> 00:13:18.528
I thought you were
a Build-A-Bear.

00:13:18.688 --> 00:13:20.128
Maybe I am.

00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:21.648
We've been hunting
Thanos for three weeks now.

00:13:21.728 --> 00:13:23.768
Deep space scans...

00:13:24.008 --> 00:13:25.968
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

00:13:27.893 --> 00:13:28.893
Tony, you fought him.

00:13:29.215 --> 00:13:30.215
Who told you that?

00:13:30.528 --> 00:13:31.568
I didn't fight him.

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.368
No, he wiped my
face with a planet...

00:13:33.488 --> 00:13:34.648
while the Bleecker
Street magician

00:13:34.728 --> 00:13:35.968
gave away the store.

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:37.048
That's what happened.

00:13:37.128 --> 00:13:38.488
There was no fight,
'cause he's not beatable.

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:41.248
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

00:13:41.368 --> 00:13:42.768
Uh...

00:13:44.288 --> 00:13:45.768
I saw this coming
a few years back.

00:13:45.928 --> 00:13:47.568
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

00:13:48.048 --> 00:13:49.528
Thought I was dreaming.

00:13:49.688 --> 00:13:50.688
Tony, I'm gonna
need you to focus.

00:13:50.848 --> 00:13:52.608
And I needed you.

00:13:52.768 --> 00:13:53.808
As in, past tense.

00:13:53.968 --> 00:13:57.248
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

00:13:57.408 --> 00:13:58.528
Sorry.

00:13:59.248 --> 00:14:02.208
You know what I need?
I need a shave.

00:14:02.888 --> 00:14:05.288
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

00:14:05.368 --> 00:14:06.488
Tony, Tony!

00:14:06.568 --> 00:14:09.968
...alive and otherwise,
that what we needed

00:14:10.048 --> 00:14:11.928
was a suit of armor
around the world.

00:14:12.008 --> 00:14:13.008
Remember that?

00:14:13.088 --> 00:14:15.768
Whether it impacted our
precious freedoms or not.

00:14:15.848 --> 00:14:17.048
That's what we needed.

00:14:17.208 --> 00:14:18.288
Well, that didn't
work out, did it?

00:14:18.488 --> 00:14:19.888
I said we'd lose.

00:14:20.048 --> 00:14:22.208
You said, "We'll do
that together, too."

00:14:22.768 --> 00:14:23.848
And guess what, Cap?

00:14:24.008 --> 00:14:25.328
We lost.

00:14:25.768 --> 00:14:26.768
And you weren't there.

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.528
But that's what we do, right?

00:14:29.688 --> 00:14:32.528
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

00:14:32.608 --> 00:14:34.648
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

00:14:34.728 --> 00:14:35.728
- Okay.
- Right?

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:37.088
You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.328
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

00:14:38.408 --> 00:14:39.888
- She's great by the way.
- Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

00:14:39.968 --> 00:14:41.648
We need you. You're new blood.

00:14:41.728 --> 00:14:44.648
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

00:14:44.768 --> 00:14:46.048
I got no coordinates...

00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:48.968
no clues, no
strategies, no options.

00:14:49.128 --> 00:14:50.848
Zero. Zip. Nada.

00:14:51.008 --> 00:14:52.768
No trust, liar.

00:14:57.288 --> 00:14:58.568
Here, take this.

00:14:58.728 --> 00:15:00.848
You find him,
you put that on...

00:15:01.328 --> 00:15:02.848
you hide.

00:15:04.128 --> 00:15:05.848
- Tony!
- I'm fine.

00:15:06.008 --> 00:15:07.728
Let me...

00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:15.528
Bruce gave him a sedative.

00:15:15.688 --> 00:15:17.408
He's gonna probably be
out for the rest of the day.

00:15:18.488 --> 00:15:19.968
You guys take care of him...

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:21.648
and I'll bring him a Xorrian
elixir when I come back.

00:15:22.248 --> 00:15:23.248
Where are you going?

00:15:23.408 --> 00:15:25.088
To kill Thanos.

00:15:28.128 --> 00:15:29.328
Hey.

00:15:29.408 --> 00:15:31.528
You know, we usually
work as a team here...

00:15:31.728 --> 00:15:33.368
and, uh, between you and
I, morale's a little fragile.

00:15:33.568 --> 00:15:35.968
We realize up there
is more your territory,

00:15:36.048 --> 00:15:37.128
but this is our fight, too.

00:15:37.288 --> 00:15:38.448
You even know where he is?

00:15:38.648 --> 00:15:39.808
I know people who might.

00:15:39.968 --> 00:15:41.288
Don't bother.

00:15:42.248 --> 00:15:44.008
I can tell you where Thanos is.

00:15:46.568 --> 00:15:49.528
Thanos spent a long
time trying to perfect me.

00:15:50.128 --> 00:15:54.208
And when he worked, he
talked about his Great Plan.

00:15:54.368 --> 00:15:57.448
Even disassembled, I
wanted to please him.

00:15:57.608 --> 00:15:59.048
I'd ask...

00:15:59.568 --> 00:16:02.248
where would we go once
his plan was complete?

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:04.728
And his answer was
always the same.

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:09.968
"To the Garden."

00:16:10.608 --> 00:16:13.328
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

00:16:13.488 --> 00:16:15.048
So, where is he?

00:16:15.328 --> 00:16:17.448
When Thanos
snapped his fingers...

00:16:17.648 --> 00:16:19.648
Earth became ground
zero for a power surge

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:21.528
of ridiculously
cosmic proportions.

00:16:21.688 --> 00:16:23.888
No one's ever
seen anything like it.

00:16:24.048 --> 00:16:25.408
Until two days ago...

00:16:27.208 --> 00:16:28.808
on this planet.

00:16:29.528 --> 00:16:31.008
Thanos is there.

00:16:32.728 --> 00:16:34.448
He used the stones again.

00:16:34.688 --> 00:16:36.448
Hey, hey, hey.

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:38.488
We'd be going in
shorthanded, you know?

00:16:38.648 --> 00:16:40.128
Look, he's still got
the stones, so...

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:41.728
So, let's get 'em.

00:16:41.888 --> 00:16:43.368
Use them to bring everyone back.

00:16:43.448 --> 00:16:44.608
Just like that?

00:16:44.688 --> 00:16:46.288
Yeah. Just like that.

00:16:46.448 --> 00:16:49.608
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:52.488
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

00:16:52.688 --> 00:16:54.288
If we do this, how do we know

00:16:54.368 --> 00:16:56.648
it's gonna end any
differently than it did before?

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.408
Because before
you didn't have me.

00:16:59.288 --> 00:17:00.448
Hey, new girl?

00:17:00.648 --> 00:17:03.328
Everybody in this room is
about that superhero life.

00:17:03.836 --> 00:17:05.128
And if you don't mind my asking,

00:17:05.208 --> 00:17:06.368
where the hell have
you been all this time?

00:17:06.448 --> 00:17:08.728
There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.

00:17:08.888 --> 00:17:11.768
And unfortunately, they
didn't have you guys.

00:17:31.408 --> 00:17:33.488
I like this one.

00:17:38.048 --> 00:17:40.528
Let's go get this
son of a bitch.

00:17:53.728 --> 00:17:54.728
Okay.

00:17:55.128 --> 00:17:57.528
Who here hasn't been to space?

00:17:58.888 --> 00:18:00.088
Why?

00:18:00.168 --> 00:18:01.848
You better not
throw up on my ship.

00:18:02.008 --> 00:18:03.328
Approaching jump in three...

00:18:03.728 --> 00:18:05.568
two, one.

00:18:19.128 --> 00:18:20.848
I'll head down for recon.

00:18:39.328 --> 00:18:40.568
This is gonna work, Steve.

00:18:40.928 --> 00:18:42.528
I know it will.

00:18:46.368 --> 00:18:48.648
'Cause I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

00:18:49.248 --> 00:18:52.728
No satellites.
No ships. No armies.

00:18:52.888 --> 00:18:54.408
No ground defenses of any kind.

00:18:56.488 --> 00:18:58.168
It's just him.

00:18:58.768 --> 00:19:00.528
And that's enough.

00:20:29.568 --> 00:20:30.808
Oh, no.

00:20:40.976 --> 00:20:42.296
Where are they?

00:20:42.591 --> 00:20:44.351
Answer the question.

00:20:46.488 --> 00:20:48.888
The universe
required correction.

00:20:49.048 --> 00:20:52.848
After that, the stones
served no purpose...

00:20:53.008 --> 00:20:54.648
beyond temptation.

00:20:54.808 --> 00:20:56.768
You murdered trillions!

00:20:57.728 --> 00:21:00.048
You should be grateful.

00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:05.448
Where are the stones?

00:21:05.608 --> 00:21:07.008
Gone.

00:21:07.168 --> 00:21:08.248
Reduced to atoms.

00:21:08.928 --> 00:21:10.408
You used them two days ago!

00:21:10.568 --> 00:21:13.808
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

00:21:14.528 --> 00:21:16.168
It nearly killed me.

00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:19.328
But the work is done.

00:21:19.768 --> 00:21:22.448
It always will be.

00:21:24.008 --> 00:21:27.408
I am inevitable.

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:32.048
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying!

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.448
My father is many things.

00:21:34.328 --> 00:21:36.408
A liar is not one of them.

00:21:38.158 --> 00:21:39.318
Ah.

00:21:40.408 --> 00:21:41.728
Thank you, daughter.

00:21:44.475 --> 00:21:46.395
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly.

00:21:53.048 --> 00:21:54.048
What?

00:21:54.728 --> 00:21:56.448
What did you do?

00:21:58.008 --> 00:21:59.808
I went for the head.

00:23:10.688 --> 00:23:12.888
<i>So...</i>

00:23:14.208 --> 00:23:16.688
...I, uh, went on a
date the other day.

00:23:16.848 --> 00:23:18.488
It's the first time
in five years.

00:23:18.688 --> 00:23:21.008
You know?
I'm sitting there at dinner.

00:23:21.543 --> 00:23:23.543
I didn't even know
what to talk about.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:26.970
What did you talk about?

00:23:27.248 --> 00:23:30.608
Eh, same old crap.
You know, how things have changed.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.980
My job, his job.

00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:35.431
How much we miss the Mets.

00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:39.852
And then things got quiet...

00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:45.408
then he cried as they
were serving the salads.

00:23:45.568 --> 00:23:47.088
What about you?

00:23:48.168 --> 00:23:51.408
I cried just before dessert.

00:23:55.168 --> 00:23:57.288
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

00:23:57.968 --> 00:23:59.208
That's great.

00:23:59.368 --> 00:24:01.048
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

00:24:01.128 --> 00:24:03.248
You didn't know where
you were gonna come down.

00:24:03.888 --> 00:24:05.768
And that's it.
That's those little

00:24:06.121 --> 00:24:08.441
brave baby steps
we gotta take...

00:24:08.523 --> 00:24:12.243
to try and become whole
again, try and find purpose.

00:24:13.888 --> 00:24:15.448
I went in the ice in '45,

00:24:15.528 --> 00:24:17.888
right after I met
the love of my life.

00:24:18.768 --> 00:24:20.528
Woke up 70 years later.

00:24:23.648 --> 00:24:25.688
You gotta move on.

00:24:28.408 --> 00:24:30.048
Gotta move on.

00:24:34.888 --> 00:24:37.288
The world is in our hands.

00:24:37.448 --> 00:24:39.528
It's left to us, guys.

00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:41.928
And we gotta do
something with it.

00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:44.048
Otherwise...

00:24:45.328 --> 00:24:47.688
Thanos should've
killed all of us.

00:25:49.608 --> 00:25:50.928
What the hell?

00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:04.568
Hope?

00:26:37.768 --> 00:26:38.768
Kid!

00:26:38.968 --> 00:26:40.008
Hey, kid!

00:26:44.328 --> 00:26:46.528
What the hell happened here?

00:27:18.208 --> 00:27:20.008
Oh, my God!

00:27:22.848 --> 00:27:24.288
Oh, please!

00:27:24.448 --> 00:27:26.008
Please, please!

00:27:26.168 --> 00:27:28.168
No, no, no. No.

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:31.008
No.

00:27:33.328 --> 00:27:34.328
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:27:34.528 --> 00:27:35.808
Oh, Cassie, no.

00:27:35.968 --> 00:27:37.408
No, no, no.

00:27:38.808 --> 00:27:40.528
No, no.

00:27:41.448 --> 00:27:44.368
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

00:27:51.568 --> 00:27:52.728
What?

00:28:22.808 --> 00:28:24.128
Cassie?

00:28:25.328 --> 00:28:26.688
Dad?

00:28:52.743 --> 00:28:55.143
You're so big!

00:29:08.448 --> 00:29:09.728
<i>Yeah. We boarded</i>

00:29:09.808 --> 00:29:12.928
<i>that highly-suspect
warship Danvers pinged.</i>

00:29:13.088 --> 00:29:14.808
<i>It was an infectious
garbage scow.</i>

00:29:14.968 --> 00:29:16.448
<i>So, thanks for the hot tip.</i>

00:29:16.608 --> 00:29:17.928
<i>Well, you were closer.</i>

00:29:18.128 --> 00:29:19.488
<i>Yeah. And now we
smell like garbage.</i>

00:29:19.568 --> 00:29:20.928
You get a reading
on those tremors?

00:29:21.088 --> 00:29:23.648
<i>'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.</i>

00:29:23.808 --> 00:29:25.888
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

00:29:26.048 --> 00:29:27.208
<i>Nat.</i>

00:29:27.648 --> 00:29:29.608
<i>It's an earthquake
under the ocean.</i>

00:29:29.808 --> 00:29:32.608
<i>We handle it by not handling it.</i>

00:29:33.368 --> 00:29:35.488
Carol, are we seeing
you here next month?

00:29:35.968 --> 00:29:37.048
<i>Not likely.</i>

00:29:37.128 --> 00:29:38.688
<i>What? You gonna
get another haircut?</i>

00:29:38.848 --> 00:29:40.168
<i>Listen, fur face.</i>

00:29:40.328 --> 00:29:42.128
<i>I'm covering a lot of territory.</i>

00:29:42.288 --> 00:29:44.088
<i>The things that are
happening on Earth</i>

00:29:44.168 --> 00:29:45.448
<i>are happening everywhere.</i>

00:29:45.768 --> 00:29:47.608
<i>On thousands of planets.</i>

00:29:47.768 --> 00:29:49.248
<i>All right, all right.
That's a good point.</i>

00:29:49.368 --> 00:29:50.448
<i>That's a good point.</i>

00:29:50.608 --> 00:29:52.688
<i>So, you might not
see me for a long time.</i>

00:29:53.528 --> 00:29:55.208
All right. Uh, well...

00:29:56.048 --> 00:29:58.208
This channel's always active.

00:29:58.368 --> 00:30:00.448
So, if anything goes sideways...

00:30:00.608 --> 00:30:03.048
anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

00:30:03.208 --> 00:30:04.368
comes through me.

00:30:04.448 --> 00:30:06.088
<i>Okay.</i>

00:30:06.168 --> 00:30:07.608
All right.

00:30:08.368 --> 00:30:09.448
<i>Good luck.</i>

00:30:18.048 --> 00:30:19.048
Where are you?

00:30:19.208 --> 00:30:20.208
<i>Mexico.</i>

00:30:20.368 --> 00:30:23.008
<i>The Federales found
a room full of bodies.</i>

00:30:23.168 --> 00:30:24.808
<i>Looks like a bunch
of cartel guys...</i>

00:30:24.968 --> 00:30:26.928
<i>never even had a chance
to get their guns off.</i>

00:30:27.088 --> 00:30:28.808
It's probably a rival gang.

00:30:28.968 --> 00:30:30.168
<i>Except it isn't.</i>

00:30:30.448 --> 00:30:32.528
<i>It's definitely Barton.</i>

00:30:33.088 --> 00:30:34.688
<i>What he's done here...</i>

00:30:34.848 --> 00:30:38.008
<i>what he's been doing
for the last few years...</i>

00:30:38.848 --> 00:30:40.648
<i>I mean, the
scene that he left...</i>

00:30:41.648 --> 00:30:42.648
<i>I gotta tell you,</i>

00:30:42.728 --> 00:30:45.208
<i>there's a part of me that
doesn't even wanna find him.</i>

00:30:50.768 --> 00:30:53.048
Will you find out
where he's going next?

00:30:56.968 --> 00:30:58.088
<i>Nat?</i>

00:30:59.888 --> 00:31:01.608
Please?

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:04.528
<i>Okay.</i>

00:31:13.328 --> 00:31:15.128
You know, I'd offer
to cook you dinner...

00:31:15.488 --> 00:31:17.048
but you seem pretty
miserable already.

00:31:21.168 --> 00:31:22.568
You here to do your laundry?

00:31:22.728 --> 00:31:24.328
And to see a friend.

00:31:25.408 --> 00:31:28.088
Clearly, your friend is fine.

00:31:30.848 --> 00:31:32.128
You know, I saw a pod of whales

00:31:32.208 --> 00:31:33.328
when I was coming
over the bridge.

00:31:33.488 --> 00:31:35.328
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships...

00:31:35.488 --> 00:31:36.768
cleaner water.

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:38.808
You know, if you're
about to tell me

00:31:38.888 --> 00:31:40.848
to look on the bright side...

00:31:41.048 --> 00:31:42.248
Um...

00:31:43.208 --> 00:31:44.608
I'm about to hit you in the head

00:31:44.688 --> 00:31:46.808
with a peanut butter sandwich.

00:31:46.888 --> 00:31:47.888
Hmm.

00:31:48.768 --> 00:31:49.928
Sorry.

00:31:50.088 --> 00:31:51.248
Force of habit.

00:32:05.528 --> 00:32:06.928
You know, I keep
telling everybody

00:32:07.048 --> 00:32:08.648
they should move on...

00:32:09.008 --> 00:32:10.488
and grow.

00:32:11.688 --> 00:32:13.008
Some do.

00:32:16.448 --> 00:32:17.968
But not us.

00:32:18.848 --> 00:32:20.768
If I move on, who does this?

00:32:21.128 --> 00:32:23.248
Maybe it doesn't
need to be done.

00:32:27.488 --> 00:32:29.728
I used to have nothing.

00:32:30.888 --> 00:32:32.808
And then I got this.

00:32:34.968 --> 00:32:36.808
This job.

00:32:39.168 --> 00:32:40.928
This family.

00:32:46.728 --> 00:32:48.608
And I was better because of it.

00:32:54.888 --> 00:32:58.408
And even though they're gone...

00:33:02.368 --> 00:33:04.808
I'm still trying to be better.

00:33:07.848 --> 00:33:10.248
I think we both
need to get a life.

00:33:12.808 --> 00:33:14.088
You first.

00:33:19.448 --> 00:33:20.808
<i>Oh, hi, hi!</i>

00:33:20.888 --> 00:33:22.088
<i>Uh, is anyone home?</i>

00:33:22.288 --> 00:33:23.968
<i>This is, uh, Scott Lang.</i>

00:33:24.128 --> 00:33:26.968
<i>We met a few years
ago at the airport...</i>

00:33:27.168 --> 00:33:28.808
<i>in Germany?</i>

00:33:29.008 --> 00:33:31.288
<i>I was the guy that got really big.
I had a mask on.</i>

00:33:31.448 --> 00:33:33.048
<i>- You wouldn't recognize me.</i>
- Is this an old message?

00:33:33.128 --> 00:33:36.088
<i>Ant-Man?
I know you know that.</i>

00:33:36.248 --> 00:33:37.328
It's the front gate.

00:33:37.408 --> 00:33:38.848
<i>I really need to
talk to you guys.</i>

00:33:45.008 --> 00:33:46.168
Scott.

00:33:47.128 --> 00:33:48.128
Are you okay?

00:33:48.288 --> 00:33:49.288
Yeah.

00:33:51.088 --> 00:33:53.488
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

00:33:53.888 --> 00:33:55.408
Only to make conversation.

00:33:56.488 --> 00:33:58.088
All right, so...

00:33:58.488 --> 00:34:01.168
five years ago, right before...

00:34:01.768 --> 00:34:02.888
Thanos...

00:34:03.288 --> 00:34:05.368
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

00:34:05.528 --> 00:34:08.048
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

00:34:08.448 --> 00:34:10.328
To get in there,
you have to be incredibly small.

00:34:10.488 --> 00:34:12.048
Hope. She's my, um...

00:34:14.128 --> 00:34:15.808
She was my...

00:34:17.528 --> 00:34:18.728
She was supposed to pull me out.

00:34:18.928 --> 00:34:20.488
And then Thanos happened...

00:34:20.648 --> 00:34:22.328
and I got stuck in there.

00:34:22.808 --> 00:34:24.768
I'm sorry, that must have
been a very long five years.

00:34:24.928 --> 00:34:26.248
Yeah, but that's just it.

00:34:26.408 --> 00:34:27.568
It wasn't.

00:34:27.768 --> 00:34:28.968
For me, it was five hours.

00:34:29.128 --> 00:34:30.448
See, the rules of
the quantum realm

00:34:30.528 --> 00:34:31.648
aren't like they are up here.

00:34:31.728 --> 00:34:33.248
Everything is unpredictable.

00:34:33.408 --> 00:34:34.648
Is that anybody's sandwich?

00:34:34.808 --> 00:34:36.048
I'm starving.

00:34:36.368 --> 00:34:37.528
Scott.

00:34:37.688 --> 00:34:38.968
What are you talking about?

00:34:39.968 --> 00:34:41.248
So...

00:34:42.168 --> 00:34:43.768
what I'm saying is...

00:34:44.648 --> 00:34:47.048
time works differently
in the quantum realm.

00:34:47.248 --> 00:34:49.088
The only problem is right now

00:34:49.208 --> 00:34:50.608
we don't have a
way to navigate it.

00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:51.688
But what if we did?

00:34:52.448 --> 00:34:53.648
I can't stop thinking about it.

00:34:53.728 --> 00:34:55.728
What if we could somehow
control the chaos...

00:34:55.808 --> 00:34:57.048
and we could navigate it?

00:34:57.128 --> 00:34:58.688
What if there was a way...

00:34:58.768 --> 00:35:00.408
that we could enter
the quantum realm

00:35:00.488 --> 00:35:01.568
at a certain point in time...

00:35:01.728 --> 00:35:03.208
but then exit the quantum realm

00:35:03.288 --> 00:35:04.448
at another point in time?

00:35:04.608 --> 00:35:05.968
Like...

00:35:06.728 --> 00:35:08.808
- Like before Thanos.
- Wait.

00:35:08.968 --> 00:35:10.528
Are you talking
about a time machine?

00:35:10.728 --> 00:35:13.488
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

00:35:13.648 --> 00:35:14.688
This is more like a...

00:35:17.008 --> 00:35:18.648
Yeah. Like a time machine.

00:35:18.808 --> 00:35:20.608
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

00:35:20.688 --> 00:35:22.808
But I can't stop
thinking about it.

00:35:22.888 --> 00:35:24.128
There's gotta be...

00:35:24.888 --> 00:35:26.288
some way...

00:35:26.368 --> 00:35:28.128
- It's crazy.
- Scott.

00:35:28.328 --> 00:35:29.608
I get emails from a raccoon...

00:35:29.768 --> 00:35:31.768
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

00:35:32.528 --> 00:35:34.608
So, who do we
talk to about this?

00:35:52.763 --> 00:35:53.843
Chow time!

00:35:56.252 --> 00:35:57.292
Maguna.

00:36:01.768 --> 00:36:03.128
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

00:36:04.168 --> 00:36:05.168
Define "lunch"

00:36:05.248 --> 00:36:06.528
- or be disintegrated.
- Okay.

00:36:07.888 --> 00:36:09.408
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

00:36:09.528 --> 00:36:10.888
That is part of a
special anniversary gift

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:12.048
I'm making for Mom.

00:36:15.808 --> 00:36:18.408
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

00:36:18.568 --> 00:36:20.488
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

00:36:20.648 --> 00:36:22.368
- No.
- That's what you want.

00:36:22.528 --> 00:36:24.648
How did you find this?

00:36:24.848 --> 00:36:26.648
- Garage.
- Really?

00:36:26.848 --> 00:36:28.848
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

00:36:29.728 --> 00:36:31.568
- I found it, though.
- Hmm.

00:36:31.768 --> 00:36:33.488
You like going in
the garage, huh?

00:36:33.688 --> 00:36:35.608
So does Daddy.

00:36:35.688 --> 00:36:38.528
It's fine, actually.
Mom never wears anything I buy her.

00:36:41.208 --> 00:36:42.488
So, I'm gonna...

00:37:00.008 --> 00:37:02.528
No. We know
what it sounds like.

00:37:02.608 --> 00:37:03.648
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

00:37:03.728 --> 00:37:04.728
is anything really impossible?

00:37:04.848 --> 00:37:07.048
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:08.888
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

00:37:08.968 --> 00:37:10.008
Can we agree on that?

00:37:10.168 --> 00:37:11.248
Thank you.

00:37:11.408 --> 00:37:13.528
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

00:37:13.888 --> 00:37:15.128
- I did.
- No.

00:37:15.288 --> 00:37:17.168
You accidentally survived.

00:37:17.248 --> 00:37:19.408
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

00:37:19.608 --> 00:37:22.688
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

00:37:24.728 --> 00:37:26.048
A time heist?

00:37:26.208 --> 00:37:28.368
Yeah, a time heist.
Of course.

00:37:28.448 --> 00:37:29.648
Why didn't we
think of this before?

00:37:29.728 --> 00:37:32.288
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

00:37:32.368 --> 00:37:34.528
The stones are in the past.

00:37:34.608 --> 00:37:35.928
We could go back,
we could get them.

00:37:36.128 --> 00:37:38.408
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

00:37:38.568 --> 00:37:40.488
Or screw it up worse
than he already has, right?

00:37:40.648 --> 00:37:41.648
I don't believe we would.

00:37:42.248 --> 00:37:44.768
Gotta say it.
I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

00:37:45.648 --> 00:37:47.368
However, high
hopes won't help...

00:37:47.528 --> 00:37:49.488
if there's no
logical, tangible way

00:37:49.568 --> 00:37:53.048
for me to safely
execute said time heist.

00:37:53.208 --> 00:37:55.088
I believe the most
likely outcome

00:37:55.168 --> 00:37:56.168
will be our collective demise.

00:37:56.248 --> 00:37:59.088
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

00:37:59.248 --> 00:38:01.928
All right? It means
no talking to our past selves...

00:38:02.008 --> 00:38:03.568
no betting on sporting events.

00:38:03.728 --> 00:38:05.488
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

00:38:06.408 --> 00:38:07.768
Are you seriously telling me

00:38:07.848 --> 00:38:09.648
that your plan to
save the universe...

00:38:09.808 --> 00:38:11.488
is based on <i>Back to the Future?</i>

00:38:12.608 --> 00:38:14.368
- Is it?
- No.

00:38:14.528 --> 00:38:15.568
Good. You had me worried there.

00:38:15.648 --> 00:38:16.688
'Cause that would be horseshit.

00:38:16.848 --> 00:38:19.168
That's not how
quantum physics works.

00:38:19.328 --> 00:38:20.488
Tony.

00:38:22.448 --> 00:38:23.888
We have to take a stand.

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:26.448
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

00:38:28.768 --> 00:38:30.088
I know you got
a lot on the line.

00:38:30.568 --> 00:38:33.128
You got a wife,
a daughter.

00:38:33.288 --> 00:38:35.808
But I lost someone
very important to me.

00:38:35.968 --> 00:38:37.568
A lotta people did.

00:38:37.728 --> 00:38:40.728
And now, now we have a
chance to bring her back...

00:38:40.888 --> 00:38:42.048
to bring everyone back,

00:38:42.128 --> 00:38:43.648
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

00:38:43.728 --> 00:38:45.528
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:48.568
I can't.

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:53.048
Mommy told me to
come and save you.

00:38:53.128 --> 00:38:55.568
Good job. I'm saved.

00:38:56.328 --> 00:38:58.368
I wish you were coming
here to ask me something else.

00:38:58.448 --> 00:38:59.568
Anything else.

00:38:59.648 --> 00:39:01.448
I'm honestly happy to
see you guys, I just...

00:39:01.528 --> 00:39:02.888
Oh, look, the
table's set for six.

00:39:03.008 --> 00:39:04.488
Tony. I get it.

00:39:04.648 --> 00:39:06.968
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

00:39:07.728 --> 00:39:09.248
But this is a second chance.

00:39:09.968 --> 00:39:12.368
I got my second
chance right here, Cap.

00:39:12.528 --> 00:39:14.088
Can't roll the dice on it.

00:39:16.168 --> 00:39:18.088
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

00:39:21.328 --> 00:39:22.528
Well, he's scared.

00:39:23.208 --> 00:39:24.328
He's not wrong.

00:39:24.448 --> 00:39:26.528
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

00:39:26.608 --> 00:39:27.888
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

00:39:28.808 --> 00:39:30.808
No, I wanna do it right.

00:39:34.008 --> 00:39:35.688
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

00:39:36.768 --> 00:39:38.208
Bigger than his?

00:39:38.648 --> 00:39:40.248
Come on, I feel like I'm
the only one eating here.

00:39:40.328 --> 00:39:41.368
Try some of that.

00:39:41.448 --> 00:39:42.448
Have some eggs.

00:39:42.928 --> 00:39:44.288
I'm so confused.

00:39:44.368 --> 00:39:46.128
These are confusing times.

00:39:46.208 --> 00:39:48.128
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

00:39:48.288 --> 00:39:50.768
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

00:39:51.368 --> 00:39:53.168
I know, it's crazy.

00:39:53.328 --> 00:39:54.528
I'm wearing shirts now.

00:39:54.688 --> 00:39:57.528
Yeah. What? How? Why?

00:39:58.008 --> 00:40:00.328
Five years ago, we
got our asses beat.

00:40:00.968 --> 00:40:02.608
Except it was worse for me...

00:40:02.768 --> 00:40:03.968
'cause I lost twice.

00:40:04.128 --> 00:40:05.928
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

00:40:06.808 --> 00:40:08.128
and then, we all lost.

00:40:08.208 --> 00:40:09.488
No one blamed you, Bruce.

00:40:09.648 --> 00:40:11.008
I did.

00:40:12.768 --> 00:40:14.008
For years, I've been
treating the Hulk

00:40:14.088 --> 00:40:15.248
like he's some
kind of disease...

00:40:15.328 --> 00:40:16.768
something to get rid of.

00:40:17.528 --> 00:40:20.208
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

00:40:20.768 --> 00:40:22.888
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

00:40:23.088 --> 00:40:25.648
I put the brains and
the brawn together...

00:40:25.808 --> 00:40:27.088
and now, look at me.

00:40:28.128 --> 00:40:29.448
Best of both worlds.

00:40:30.208 --> 00:40:31.528
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

00:40:31.688 --> 00:40:33.048
Can we get a photo?

00:40:33.448 --> 00:40:35.448
100%, little person.

00:40:35.608 --> 00:40:37.648
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

00:40:38.368 --> 00:40:40.128
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

00:40:40.208 --> 00:40:41.808
Say "green."

00:40:41.968 --> 00:40:44.208
- Green.
- Green.

00:40:44.288 --> 00:40:45.288
Did you get that?

00:40:45.448 --> 00:40:46.728
That's a good one.

00:40:47.488 --> 00:40:49.768
Did you want to grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.

00:40:53.448 --> 00:40:55.368
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

00:40:55.448 --> 00:40:56.608
- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take

00:40:56.688 --> 00:40:58.408
- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

00:40:58.488 --> 00:40:59.568
Stranger danger.

00:40:59.648 --> 00:41:01.168
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

00:41:01.288 --> 00:41:02.288
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

00:41:02.368 --> 00:41:03.488
But come on. The kid...

00:41:03.568 --> 00:41:04.968
I don't want a
picture with them.

00:41:05.168 --> 00:41:06.168
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

00:41:06.248 --> 00:41:07.568
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

00:41:07.648 --> 00:41:09.208
- I don't want to do it.
- We can do it.

00:41:09.288 --> 00:41:11.328
- No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

00:41:11.408 --> 00:41:12.608
Okay.

00:41:12.688 --> 00:41:13.688
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

00:41:13.768 --> 00:41:15.448
No, it was great, kids.
Thank you very much.

00:41:15.928 --> 00:41:17.288
Hulk out!

00:41:17.448 --> 00:41:18.488
Bruce.

00:41:18.928 --> 00:41:19.928
Dab.

00:41:20.248 --> 00:41:21.888
- Bruce.
- Listen to your mom.

00:41:22.248 --> 00:41:23.248
She knows better.

00:41:23.408 --> 00:41:25.088
About what we were saying.

00:41:25.248 --> 00:41:26.448
Right.

00:41:28.408 --> 00:41:31.088
The whole time travel do-over?

00:41:32.368 --> 00:41:36.128
Eh, guys, it's outside
of my area of expertise.

00:41:36.608 --> 00:41:37.848
Well, you pulled this off.

00:41:38.888 --> 00:41:42.688
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

00:42:15.968 --> 00:42:17.528
I've got a mild inspiration.

00:42:17.608 --> 00:42:18.888
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

00:42:18.968 --> 00:42:21.048
So, I'd like to run one last sim

00:42:21.128 --> 00:42:22.728
before we pack
it in for the night.

00:42:22.888 --> 00:42:25.888
This time, in the
shape of a Mobius strip,

00:42:25.968 --> 00:42:27.368
inverted, please.

00:42:27.448 --> 00:42:28.528
<i>Processing.</i>

00:42:31.968 --> 00:42:34.488
Right, give me the
eigenvalue of that particle...

00:42:34.648 --> 00:42:36.648
factoring in spectral decomp.

00:42:36.848 --> 00:42:38.768
- That'll take a second.
<i><i>- Just a moment.</i>

00:42:39.848 --> 00:42:42.688
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

00:42:44.248 --> 00:42:45.728
<i>Model rendered.</i>

00:42:57.568 --> 00:42:58.568
Shit!

00:42:58.888 --> 00:43:00.128
Shit!

00:43:04.208 --> 00:43:05.888
What are you
doing up, little miss?

00:43:06.048 --> 00:43:07.768
- Shit.
- Nope. We don't say that.

00:43:07.928 --> 00:43:09.168
Only Mommy says that word.

00:43:09.328 --> 00:43:10.728
She coined it.
It belongs to her.

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:11.888
Why are you up?

00:43:12.048 --> 00:43:13.408
'Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!

00:43:13.568 --> 00:43:14.728
Why do you think?

00:43:14.928 --> 00:43:16.448
No, I got something on my mind.

00:43:16.528 --> 00:43:17.888
I got something on my mind.

00:43:18.048 --> 00:43:19.568
Was it juice pops?

00:43:21.128 --> 00:43:22.328
Sure was.

00:43:23.728 --> 00:43:25.488
That's extortion.
That's a word.

00:43:25.648 --> 00:43:26.848
What kind you want?

00:43:27.008 --> 00:43:28.008
Great minds think alike.

00:43:28.168 --> 00:43:30.008
Juice pops exactly...

00:43:32.168 --> 00:43:33.288
was on my mind.

00:43:34.728 --> 00:43:35.848
You done? Yeah?

00:43:36.368 --> 00:43:37.608
Now you are.

00:43:38.168 --> 00:43:39.328
Here. Wipe.

00:43:42.048 --> 00:43:44.728
Good.
That face goes there.

00:43:44.888 --> 00:43:46.128
Tell me a story.

00:43:46.328 --> 00:43:47.888
A story.

00:43:48.048 --> 00:43:50.208
Once upon a time,
Maguna went to bed. The end.

00:43:50.568 --> 00:43:51.928
That is a horrible story.

00:43:52.128 --> 00:43:53.848
Come on, that's
your favorite story.

00:43:54.568 --> 00:43:55.728
Love you tons.

00:43:57.728 --> 00:43:59.568
I love you 3,000.

00:44:00.785 --> 00:44:01.745
Wow.

00:44:09.168 --> 00:44:12.048
3,000.
That's crazy.

00:44:13.248 --> 00:44:15.048
Go to bed or
I'll sell all your toys.

00:44:16.248 --> 00:44:17.608
Night night.

00:44:17.768 --> 00:44:18.968
Not that it's a competition...

00:44:19.488 --> 00:44:21.408
but she loves me 3,000.

00:44:21.568 --> 00:44:22.648
Does she, now?

00:44:22.808 --> 00:44:25.848
You were somewhere
in the low 6 to 900 range.

00:44:31.888 --> 00:44:33.408
Whatcha reading?

00:44:34.048 --> 00:44:35.488
Just a book on composting.

00:44:35.648 --> 00:44:37.728
What's new with composting?

00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:41.248
- Interesting science...
- I figured it out.

00:44:42.171 --> 00:44:43.171
By the way.

00:44:44.208 --> 00:44:45.368
And, you know,

00:44:45.448 --> 00:44:47.568
just so we're talking
about the same thing...

00:44:47.728 --> 00:44:49.208
Time travel.

00:44:49.728 --> 00:44:50.728
What?

00:44:54.928 --> 00:44:55.928
Wow.

00:45:00.008 --> 00:45:01.568
That's amazing...

00:45:02.528 --> 00:45:03.648
and terrifying.

00:45:03.808 --> 00:45:05.248
That's right.

00:45:12.568 --> 00:45:14.288
We got really lucky.

00:45:14.448 --> 00:45:15.448
Yeah.

00:45:15.608 --> 00:45:16.728
I know.

00:45:16.888 --> 00:45:18.048
A lot of people didn't.

00:45:18.208 --> 00:45:19.808
Nope.
And I can't help everybody.

00:45:21.568 --> 00:45:22.928
Sorta seems like you can.

00:45:23.088 --> 00:45:24.688
Not if I stop.

00:45:25.888 --> 00:45:28.768
I can put a pin in it
right now and stop.

00:45:29.528 --> 00:45:30.528
Tony...

00:45:31.248 --> 00:45:32.808
trying to get you to stop...

00:45:32.968 --> 00:45:35.568
has been one of the few
failures of my entire life.

00:45:39.888 --> 00:45:41.568
Something tells me...

00:45:42.848 --> 00:45:43.928
I should put it in a lockbox

00:45:44.008 --> 00:45:45.528
and drop it to the
bottom of the lake...

00:45:46.728 --> 00:45:47.928
and go to bed.

00:45:54.328 --> 00:45:56.368
But would you be able to rest?

00:46:01.088 --> 00:46:04.408
Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

00:46:04.568 --> 00:46:06.728
Scott, fire up...

00:46:07.648 --> 00:46:08.848
the, uh, van thing.

00:46:11.128 --> 00:46:12.168
Breakers are set.

00:46:12.328 --> 00:46:14.168
Emergency generators
are on standby.

00:46:14.328 --> 00:46:16.048
Good, because if
we blow the grid,

00:46:16.128 --> 00:46:19.328
I don't want to lose, uh,
Tiny here in the 1950s.

00:46:19.408 --> 00:46:22.368
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

00:46:22.568 --> 00:46:24.448
You can't say things like that.

00:46:24.528 --> 00:46:26.168
It was a bad joke.

00:46:28.168 --> 00:46:29.168
You were kidding, right?

00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:32.448
I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.

00:46:32.608 --> 00:46:34.848
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

00:46:35.008 --> 00:46:36.688
We're good!

00:46:36.848 --> 00:46:38.208
Get your helmet on.

00:46:38.808 --> 00:46:40.688
Scott, I'm gonna send
you back a week...

00:46:40.768 --> 00:46:42.408
let you walk around for an hour,

00:46:42.488 --> 00:46:44.008
then bring you
back in 10 seconds.

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:45.168
Make sense?

00:46:45.808 --> 00:46:47.088
Perfectly not confusing.

00:46:47.248 --> 00:46:49.208
Good luck, Scott.
You got this.

00:46:50.768 --> 00:46:53.808
You're right.
I do, Captain America.

00:46:55.968 --> 00:46:57.288
On a count of three...

00:46:57.448 --> 00:47:01.328
Three, two, one.

00:47:04.608 --> 00:47:06.248
Uh... Guys?

00:47:06.728 --> 00:47:08.288
This doesn't feel right.

00:47:08.408 --> 00:47:09.408
What is this?

00:47:09.488 --> 00:47:10.488
- What's going on?
- Who is that?

00:47:10.568 --> 00:47:11.568
- Hold on.
- Is that Scott?

00:47:11.648 --> 00:47:12.648
Yes, it's Scott.

00:47:15.528 --> 00:47:18.168
- What's going on, Bruce?
- Oh, my back!

00:47:18.248 --> 00:47:19.248
- What is this?
- Hold on a second.

00:47:19.328 --> 00:47:20.328
Could I get a little space here?

00:47:20.408 --> 00:47:21.528
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

00:47:21.608 --> 00:47:22.648
I'm working on it.

00:47:29.688 --> 00:47:30.688
It's a baby.

00:47:30.888 --> 00:47:32.408
- It's Scott.
- As a baby.

00:47:32.568 --> 00:47:34.048
- He'll grow.
- Bring Scott back.

00:47:34.128 --> 00:47:35.568
When I say kill the power,
kill the power.

00:47:35.648 --> 00:47:36.928
Oh, my God.

00:47:37.648 --> 00:47:39.008
And... kill it!

00:47:43.408 --> 00:47:45.208
Somebody peed my pants.

00:47:45.288 --> 00:47:46.328
Oh, thank God.

00:47:46.528 --> 00:47:49.728
But I don't know if it
was baby me or old me.

00:47:53.048 --> 00:47:55.008
Or just me me.

00:47:55.448 --> 00:47:56.648
Time travel!

00:48:00.408 --> 00:48:01.408
What?

00:48:03.088 --> 00:48:05.328
I see this as an absolute win.

00:48:51.008 --> 00:48:52.288
Why the long face?

00:48:52.448 --> 00:48:54.208
Let me guess, he
turned into a baby.

00:48:55.448 --> 00:48:57.448
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

00:48:57.608 --> 00:48:59.048
It's the EPR Paradox.

00:48:59.848 --> 00:49:00.848
Instead of pushing
Lang through time,

00:49:00.928 --> 00:49:01.928
you might've wound up...

00:49:02.048 --> 00:49:03.448
pushing time through Lang.

00:49:03.648 --> 00:49:04.768
It's tricky, dangerous.

00:49:04.848 --> 00:49:06.288
Somebody could have
cautioned you against it.

00:49:06.448 --> 00:49:07.488
You did.

00:49:07.608 --> 00:49:08.808
Oh, did I?

00:49:08.968 --> 00:49:10.648
Well, thank God I'm here.

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:13.048
Regardless, I fixed it.

00:49:14.128 --> 00:49:16.448
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

00:49:18.528 --> 00:49:19.768
I just want peace.

00:49:21.408 --> 00:49:24.128
Turns out resentment
is corrosive, and I hate it.

00:49:24.968 --> 00:49:26.368
Me, too.

00:49:27.608 --> 00:49:29.088
We got a shot at
getting these stones,

00:49:29.168 --> 00:49:31.088
but I gotta tell
you my priorities.

00:49:31.248 --> 00:49:33.568
Bring back what
we lost, I hope, yes.

00:49:33.728 --> 00:49:36.568
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

00:49:37.848 --> 00:49:40.408
And maybe not die trying.

00:49:40.568 --> 00:49:41.648
Would be nice.

00:49:44.088 --> 00:49:45.168
Sounds like a deal.

00:50:08.768 --> 00:50:09.768
Tony, I don't know.

00:50:09.968 --> 00:50:11.568
Why?

00:50:11.728 --> 00:50:13.528
He made it for you.

00:50:13.688 --> 00:50:15.448
Plus, honestly, I have
to get it out of the garage

00:50:15.528 --> 00:50:17.288
before Morgan takes it sledding.

00:50:22.848 --> 00:50:23.968
Thank you, Tony.

00:50:24.968 --> 00:50:26.488
Will you keep
that a little quiet?

00:50:27.208 --> 00:50:28.608
Didn't bring one
for the whole team.

00:50:30.328 --> 00:50:33.648
We are getting the
whole team, yeah?

00:50:33.808 --> 00:50:35.568
We're working on that right now.

00:50:53.648 --> 00:50:54.688
Hey, Humie.

00:50:55.248 --> 00:50:57.048
Where's Big Green?

00:50:57.368 --> 00:50:59.408
The kitchen, I think.

00:51:00.648 --> 00:51:01.888
That's awesome.

00:51:03.088 --> 00:51:05.168
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:07.048
There's an idiot in
the landing zone.

00:51:08.208 --> 00:51:09.328
Oh, God.

00:51:09.928 --> 00:51:11.968
<i>What's up, Regular-Sized Man?</i>

00:52:02.808 --> 00:52:05.288
Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces

00:52:05.368 --> 00:52:07.088
and the magic
hammers and whatnot.

00:52:07.248 --> 00:52:08.608
Hey, have a little
compassion, pal.

00:52:08.768 --> 00:52:10.728
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

00:52:10.888 --> 00:52:12.448
They're probably just
happy to have a home.

00:52:12.608 --> 00:52:14.328
You shouldn't have come.

00:52:14.408 --> 00:52:15.968
Ah!

00:52:16.408 --> 00:52:17.408
Valkyrie!

00:52:17.568 --> 00:52:20.288
Great to see you, angry girl!

00:52:20.448 --> 00:52:22.648
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

00:52:23.928 --> 00:52:25.728
- This is Rocket.
- How ya doing?

00:52:28.128 --> 00:52:29.128
He won't see you.

00:52:29.448 --> 00:52:30.488
It's that bad, huh?

00:52:30.688 --> 00:52:32.088
We only see him once a month

00:52:32.168 --> 00:52:35.288
when he comes in for "supplies."

00:52:36.368 --> 00:52:37.528
It's that bad.

00:52:37.688 --> 00:52:38.688
Yeah.

00:52:51.208 --> 00:52:52.248
What the...?

00:52:54.728 --> 00:52:57.328
Whew!
Something died in here!

00:52:57.408 --> 00:53:00.688
Hello?
Thor!

00:53:01.248 --> 00:53:02.928
Are you here about the cable?

00:53:03.648 --> 00:53:05.728
The Cinemax went out
two weeks ago...

00:53:06.328 --> 00:53:09.088
and the sports are all
kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

00:53:09.848 --> 00:53:10.848
Thor?

00:53:18.768 --> 00:53:21.328
Boys!
Oh, my God!

00:53:21.968 --> 00:53:24.728
Oh, my God, it's
so good to see you!

00:53:26.168 --> 00:53:27.488
Come here, cuddly little rascal.

00:53:27.648 --> 00:53:30.128
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

00:53:30.288 --> 00:53:31.368
That's not necessary.

00:53:31.808 --> 00:53:34.488
Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?

00:53:34.648 --> 00:53:35.768
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys.

00:53:35.928 --> 00:53:37.208
Long time no see.

00:53:37.368 --> 00:53:38.368
Beer's in the bucket.

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:39.608
Feel free to log
on to the Wi-Fi.

00:53:39.768 --> 00:53:41.488
No password, obviously.

00:53:42.568 --> 00:53:44.088
Thor, he's back.

00:53:44.248 --> 00:53:46.928
That kid on the TV just
called me a dickhead again.

00:53:47.448 --> 00:53:48.488
Noobmaster.

00:53:48.648 --> 00:53:51.128
Yeah, NoobMaster69
called me a dickhead.

00:53:51.288 --> 00:53:52.448
I am sick of this.

00:53:53.368 --> 00:53:55.048
Noobmaster, hey,
it's Thor again.

00:53:55.128 --> 00:53:56.288
You know, the God of Thunder.

00:53:56.448 --> 00:53:58.648
Listen, bud, if you don't
log off this game immediately...

00:53:58.808 --> 00:54:00.288
I am gonna fly
over to your house,

00:54:00.448 --> 00:54:01.928
come down to that
basement you're hiding in...

00:54:02.088 --> 00:54:04.728
rip off your arms, and
shove them up your butt!

00:54:05.088 --> 00:54:06.168
Oh, that's right, yes!

00:54:06.288 --> 00:54:08.128
Go cry to your father,
you little weasel.

00:54:08.848 --> 00:54:09.848
Thank you, Thor.

00:54:09.928 --> 00:54:11.368
Let me know if he
bothers you again, okay?

00:54:11.528 --> 00:54:12.728
Thank you very much. I will.

00:54:13.528 --> 00:54:15.088
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

00:54:15.208 --> 00:54:17.608
I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

00:54:20.488 --> 00:54:21.888
Buddy.

00:54:22.088 --> 00:54:24.528
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Why?

00:54:24.688 --> 00:54:25.728
Why, don't I look all right?

00:54:26.168 --> 00:54:27.568
You look like melted ice cream.

00:54:29.568 --> 00:54:31.648
So, what's up?
You just here for a hang, or what?

00:54:31.848 --> 00:54:33.968
- We need your help.
- Mm.

00:54:34.048 --> 00:54:36.328
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

00:54:36.488 --> 00:54:37.848
What, like the cable?

00:54:37.928 --> 00:54:40.208
'Cause that's been driving
me bananas for weeks.

00:54:40.368 --> 00:54:41.368
Like Thanos.

00:55:00.568 --> 00:55:03.408
Don't say that name.

00:55:04.208 --> 00:55:07.248
Um, yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.

00:55:12.088 --> 00:55:13.968
Please take your hand off me.

00:55:17.368 --> 00:55:20.408
Now, I know that guy...

00:55:21.328 --> 00:55:22.448
might scare you.

00:55:22.648 --> 00:55:24.088
Why would I be...?

00:55:24.168 --> 00:55:27.328
Why would I be
scared of that guy?

00:55:27.528 --> 00:55:29.328
I'm the one who killed
that guy, remember?

00:55:29.448 --> 00:55:30.608
Hmm.

00:55:30.688 --> 00:55:32.568
Anyone else here kill that guy?

00:55:35.968 --> 00:55:37.048
Nope.

00:55:37.608 --> 00:55:38.608
Didn't think so.

00:55:39.688 --> 00:55:41.528
Korg, why don't you,
uh, tell everybody

00:55:41.608 --> 00:55:43.968
who chopped
Thanos' big head off?

00:55:44.048 --> 00:55:45.528
Um, Stormbreaker?

00:55:45.688 --> 00:55:47.328
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

00:55:51.408 --> 00:55:53.608
I get it.
You're in a rough spot, okay?

00:55:53.808 --> 00:55:54.808
I've been there myself.

00:55:54.968 --> 00:55:57.248
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

00:55:57.408 --> 00:55:59.768
Was it Natasha?

00:56:00.208 --> 00:56:02.088
It was you.

00:56:02.248 --> 00:56:04.208
You helped me.

00:56:05.408 --> 00:56:06.888
So, why don't you ask...

00:56:07.968 --> 00:56:10.288
the Asgardians down there...

00:56:10.488 --> 00:56:12.168
how much my help is worth?

00:56:17.848 --> 00:56:19.328
The ones that are left, anyway.

00:56:19.848 --> 00:56:21.448
I think we could
bring them back.

00:56:21.528 --> 00:56:23.368
Stop.

00:56:24.488 --> 00:56:26.248
Stop, okay?

00:56:26.328 --> 00:56:27.528
I know you think I'm down here

00:56:27.608 --> 00:56:29.248
wallowing in my own self-pity...

00:56:29.408 --> 00:56:31.968
waiting to be
rescued and saved...

00:56:32.128 --> 00:56:34.208
but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

00:56:34.368 --> 00:56:35.848
Oh, we're good here, mate.

00:56:36.008 --> 00:56:37.968
So, whatever it is that you're
offering, we're not into it.

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.640
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

00:56:39.808 --> 00:56:40.888
Goodbye.

00:56:44.248 --> 00:56:45.968
We need you, pal.

00:56:55.408 --> 00:56:57.408
There's beer on the ship.

00:57:01.448 --> 00:57:02.916
What kind?
