WEBVTT

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.241
We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:42.841
<i>Zehobereians.</i>

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.761
Mother! Where's my mother?

00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:46.241
<i>Choose a side or die.</i>

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:47.881
Mother!

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:50.241
<i> One side is a revelation...</i>

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:53.441
<i>the other an honor
known only to a few.</i>

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:55.801
What's wrong, little one?

00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:59.848
My mother.
Where is my mother?

00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:05.881
What's your name?

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:08.881
Gamora.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.481
You're quite the
fighter, Gamora.

00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:14.041
Come.

00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:15.401
Let me help you.

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.041
Look.

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:35.401
Pretty, isn't it?

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:39.601
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:43.521
Too much to one
side or the other...

00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:50.361
Here. You try.

00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:57.201
<i>Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.</i>

00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:00.561
Uh-uh.

00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:04.001
Concentrate.

00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:09.761
There. You've got it.

00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:20.361
Gamora.

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:22.521
Do you know if these grenades

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:24.761
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?

00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:26.041
Because I was thinking about

00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:27.681
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.

00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:28.881
But I don't want
to if they're the...

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:30.201
I need to ask a favor.

00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:32.441
Yeah, sure.

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:35.081
One way or another,

00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:37.401
the path that we're
on leads to Thanos.

00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:40.681
Which is what the
grenades are for.

00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:43.921
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?

00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:47.241
If things go wrong...

00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:51.001
If Thanos gets me...

00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:57.521
I want you to promise me...

00:02:58.561 --> 00:02:59.681
you'll kill me.

00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:01.441
What?

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.001
I know something he doesn't.

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.761
And if he finds it out,

00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:13.201
the entire universe
could be at risk.

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:14.961
What do you know?

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:17.161
If I tell you, you'd know too.

00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:22.041
If it's so important...

00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:23.161
shouldn't I?

00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:24.561
Only if you wanna die.

00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:26.281
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:28.721
Just...

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.019
Trust me. And possibly kill me.

00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:36.547
I mean, I'd like to.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.469
I really would. But you...

00:03:38.722 --> 00:03:39.922
Swear to me.

00:03:43.412 --> 00:03:45.692
Swear to me on your mother.

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:53.841
Okay.

00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:01.041
Okay.

00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:18.261
- Oh.
- Dude.

00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:19.921
How long have you
been standing there?

00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:21.001
An hour.

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:22.801
An hour?

00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:24.641
Are you serious?

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:26.793
I've mastered the ability

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:29.556
of standing so
incredibly still...

00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:33.521
that I become
invisible to the eye.

00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:35.161
Watch.

00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:40.641
You're eating a zarg-nut.

00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:42.521
But my movement...

00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:45.001
was so slow...

00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:47.681
that it's imperceptible.

00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:48.841
Mmm, no.

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:51.241
I'm sure I'm invisible.

00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:52.601
Hi, Drax.

00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:56.321
Damn it.

00:05:47.203 --> 00:05:48.963
This place looks deserted.

00:05:49.123 --> 00:05:51.883
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

00:05:52.043 --> 00:05:53.963
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

00:05:55.363 --> 00:05:56.843
Let's put down right here.

00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:10.123
I don't have it.

00:06:12.283 --> 00:06:13.963
Everyone in the galaxy knows

00:06:14.043 --> 00:06:15.483
you'd sell your own brother...

00:06:15.643 --> 00:06:17.283
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:19.363
to your pathetic collection.

00:06:27.163 --> 00:06:29.563
I know you have the
Reality Stone, Tivan.

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:34.003
Giving it to me will spare
you a great deal of suffering.

00:06:37.243 --> 00:06:38.843
I told you.

00:06:39.643 --> 00:06:40.643
I sold it.

00:06:43.523 --> 00:06:45.523
Why would I lie?

00:06:45.683 --> 00:06:47.883
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

00:06:48.723 --> 00:06:50.443
Like suicide.

00:06:50.603 --> 00:06:52.083
You do understand.

00:06:53.043 --> 00:06:56.043
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

00:06:56.243 --> 00:06:57.603
I didn't know what it was.

00:06:57.963 --> 00:07:00.563
Then you're more of a
fool than I took you for.

00:07:00.923 --> 00:07:01.923
It's him.

00:07:02.123 --> 00:07:03.563
Last chance, charlatan.

00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:07.083
Where's the stone?

00:07:07.243 --> 00:07:08.243
Today...

00:07:08.643 --> 00:07:09.643
Drax. Drax.

00:07:09.803 --> 00:07:11.803
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

00:07:11.883 --> 00:07:12.923
Drax, wait.

00:07:14.403 --> 00:07:15.803
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

00:07:15.963 --> 00:07:17.203
Drax.

00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:23.323
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.

00:07:23.483 --> 00:07:25.763
He doesn't have the stone yet.

00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:27.563
If we get it, then
we can stop him.

00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:31.563
We have to get the stone first.
Yeah.

00:07:31.723 --> 00:07:32.803
No.

00:07:32.963 --> 00:07:36.003
No.
For Ovette, for Camaria.

00:07:36.483 --> 00:07:37.763
Sleep.

00:07:49.683 --> 00:07:50.683
Okay.

00:07:50.843 --> 00:07:54.963
Gamora, Mantis,
you go right.

00:07:56.323 --> 00:07:57.563
The other right.

00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:23.603
Why?

00:08:33.603 --> 00:08:37.643
Why you, daughter?

00:08:56.283 --> 00:08:57.323
That was quick.

00:09:03.083 --> 00:09:07.963
Magnificent!
Magnificent! Magnificent!

00:09:10.323 --> 00:09:13.043
<i>Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?</i>

00:09:16.163 --> 00:09:18.643
<i>In my heart,
I knew you still cared.</i>

00:09:26.043 --> 00:09:29.283
<i>But one never knows for sure.</i>

00:09:38.523 --> 00:09:41.363
<i>Reality is often disappointing.</i>

00:09:44.523 --> 00:09:46.763
That is, it was.

00:09:48.803 --> 00:09:50.203
Now...

00:09:52.203 --> 00:09:55.003
reality can be whatever I want.

00:09:56.523 --> 00:09:58.003
You knew I'd come.

00:09:58.163 --> 00:09:59.803
I counted on it.

00:10:00.563 --> 00:10:03.483
There's something we
need to discuss, little one.

00:10:08.123 --> 00:10:09.843
Thanos!

00:10:17.443 --> 00:10:18.483
No!

00:10:22.843 --> 00:10:24.443
Let her go, Grimace.

00:10:24.883 --> 00:10:25.883
Peter.

00:10:27.363 --> 00:10:28.603
I told you to go right.

00:10:29.203 --> 00:10:30.563
Now? Really?

00:10:30.723 --> 00:10:32.163
You let her go!

00:10:32.563 --> 00:10:34.283
Ah, the boyfriend.

00:10:34.443 --> 00:10:35.443
No.

00:10:35.603 --> 00:10:36.763
Like to think of myself

00:10:36.843 --> 00:10:39.323
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

00:10:39.483 --> 00:10:41.523
- Let her go.
- Peter.

00:10:41.723 --> 00:10:46.403
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

00:10:47.003 --> 00:10:48.483
Not him.

00:10:58.963 --> 00:11:02.683
You promised.
You promised.

00:11:06.843 --> 00:11:08.043
Oh, daughter.

00:11:08.523 --> 00:11:11.003
You expect too much from him.

00:11:14.603 --> 00:11:16.203
She's asked, hasn't she?

00:11:20.163 --> 00:11:21.163
Do it.

00:11:25.003 --> 00:11:26.243
Mmm.

00:11:27.523 --> 00:11:28.923
Do it!

00:11:35.886 --> 00:11:37.286
I told you to go right.

00:11:39.043 --> 00:11:42.003
I love you more than anything.

00:11:45.123 --> 00:11:46.643
I love you too.

00:12:00.963 --> 00:12:02.003
I like him.

00:12:40.648 --> 00:12:42.888
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Maria Rambeau.

00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:46.655
Auntie Carol?

00:12:46.815 --> 00:12:48.735
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.455
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:54.735
But we knew they were lying.

00:12:56.855 --> 00:12:58.975
I'm not really who
you think I am.

00:13:08.175 --> 00:13:10.135
That is the craziest
shit I ever heard.

00:13:10.335 --> 00:13:13.335
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

00:13:13.495 --> 00:13:15.015
You are absolutely
right, young lady.

00:13:15.095 --> 00:13:16.615
There is no such thing.

00:13:16.775 --> 00:13:18.175
'Cause if there were,

00:13:18.255 --> 00:13:20.695
we would want to
keep that to ourselves.

00:13:20.855 --> 00:13:21.935
You don't believe me?

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:31.175
No way!

00:13:31.615 --> 00:13:33.495
That's so cool!

00:13:33.695 --> 00:13:35.175
Oh, she can do a lot
more than make tea

00:13:35.255 --> 00:13:36.375
with those hands.

00:13:36.472 --> 00:13:37.552
Like what? Show us.

00:13:38.225 --> 00:13:39.585
Maybe later.

00:13:40.295 --> 00:13:41.535
I kept all your stuff.

00:13:41.586 --> 00:13:42.746
I'll go get it.

00:13:43.895 --> 00:13:45.455
You want to give
her a hand with that?

00:13:45.775 --> 00:13:46.855
Hmm?

00:14:01.855 --> 00:14:03.775
You don't remember anything?

00:14:05.255 --> 00:14:08.535
I see flashes.

00:14:09.695 --> 00:14:11.095
Little moments.

00:14:12.095 --> 00:14:13.575
But I can't tell what's real.

00:14:15.895 --> 00:14:19.175
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

00:14:19.735 --> 00:14:22.015
maybe it'll all make sense.

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:28.335
You woke me up banging
on my door at dawn.

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:30.055
Your usual move.

00:14:30.815 --> 00:14:33.215
Back then, we had
to get up so early.

00:14:33.735 --> 00:14:36.255
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

00:14:36.415 --> 00:14:38.935
so testing Lawson's
planes was our only shot

00:14:39.015 --> 00:14:40.255
at doing something
that mattered.

00:14:40.415 --> 00:14:43.175
You wanted to race to
base in your old Mustang...

00:14:43.295 --> 00:14:44.295
and I wasn't about to argue,

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:46.175
'cause I knew my
Camaro would dominate.

00:14:46.335 --> 00:14:48.455
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

00:14:48.615 --> 00:14:50.175
Since when is a
shortcut cheating?

00:14:50.335 --> 00:14:51.375
Since it violates
the predetermined

00:14:51.455 --> 00:14:52.455
rules of engagement.

00:14:52.575 --> 00:14:53.775
I definitely don't
remember those.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.575
Hmm. Of course you don't.

00:15:00.455 --> 00:15:05.775
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

00:15:05.935 --> 00:15:08.975
She said she had lives to save.

00:15:09.935 --> 00:15:11.375
She was trying to
take the Asis up herself,

00:15:11.455 --> 00:15:12.495
but you said that...

00:15:12.655 --> 00:15:16.175
If there were lives at
stake, I would fly the plane.

00:15:16.375 --> 00:15:20.615
Yeah. Yep.
Big hero moment.

00:15:21.215 --> 00:15:24.215
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

00:15:25.135 --> 00:15:28.695
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

00:15:28.855 --> 00:15:33.535
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

00:15:35.295 --> 00:15:36.815
I know this must
be hard for you.

00:15:36.975 --> 00:15:38.895
Oh, what? This part right here?

00:15:39.695 --> 00:15:42.055
No.
No. Mmm-mmm.

00:15:44.815 --> 00:15:48.855
Oh, what's hard is
losing my best friend...

00:15:49.335 --> 00:15:50.695
in a mission so secret

00:15:50.775 --> 00:15:52.855
they act like it never
even happened.

00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:58.455
Hard is knowing you
were out there somewhere

00:15:58.535 --> 00:16:00.415
too damn stubborn to die.

00:16:01.735 --> 00:16:04.495
And now you come up
in here after six years...

00:16:04.655 --> 00:16:06.535
with your supercharged
fire hands...

00:16:06.695 --> 00:16:08.095
and you expect me to call you...

00:16:08.815 --> 00:16:10.495
I don't even know what. Vers?

00:16:12.255 --> 00:16:14.215
Is that really who you are now?

00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:18.255
I don't know.

00:16:23.335 --> 00:16:24.895
Come look!

00:16:31.295 --> 00:16:32.895
This is me and you on Halloween.

00:16:33.055 --> 00:16:36.335
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

00:16:36.535 --> 00:16:38.015
Oh, this is you
when you were little.

00:16:38.175 --> 00:16:39.975
You didn't get along
with your parents...

00:16:40.135 --> 00:16:41.695
so Mom said we
became your real family.

00:16:41.855 --> 00:16:43.415
This is us on Christmas.

00:16:43.575 --> 00:16:44.735
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

00:16:44.895 --> 00:16:46.495
This is another picture of
you when you were little.

00:16:46.655 --> 00:16:47.655
You've always
wanted to be a pilot.

00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:48.815
And this is right
after you graduated.

00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:50.495
This was your dog that
you got for Christmas...

00:16:50.655 --> 00:16:52.335
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

00:16:52.495 --> 00:16:53.655
And this is you with Mom

00:16:53.735 --> 00:16:54.895
right after a good
day of training.

00:16:55.095 --> 00:16:56.375
These were your
three favorite guys.

00:16:58.423 --> 00:16:59.975
Oh, wait. I forgot.

00:17:00.135 --> 00:17:01.535
Your jacket.

00:17:01.775 --> 00:17:03.095
Mom doesn't let
me wear it anymore

00:17:03.175 --> 00:17:04.815
after I spilled ketchup on it.

00:17:18.033 --> 00:17:20.455
That was all that
survived the crash.

00:17:21.735 --> 00:17:23.415
Or so we thought.

00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:29.775
Don't answer that.

00:17:29.935 --> 00:17:31.575
It's just my neighbor.

00:17:31.735 --> 00:17:33.415
They can change into anyone.

00:17:38.868 --> 00:17:39.868
Hi there.

00:17:40.548 --> 00:17:41.548
What do you want?

00:17:42.575 --> 00:17:44.255
- Uh...
- Hey, Tom.

00:17:44.335 --> 00:17:45.855
This is my friend, Carol.

00:17:45.935 --> 00:17:47.295
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:50.695
Yowzers.

00:17:50.775 --> 00:17:53.055
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

00:17:53.815 --> 00:17:56.535
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

00:17:56.695 --> 00:17:57.695
and I was just wondering...

00:17:57.855 --> 00:17:58.975
if you mind if I
bring the boys over

00:17:59.055 --> 00:18:00.135
to get a closer look-see?

00:18:00.335 --> 00:18:02.575
- A closer look-see?
- Yeah.

00:18:02.735 --> 00:18:05.855
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

00:18:06.175 --> 00:18:07.215
Mmm.

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.735
You're really working overtime

00:18:08.815 --> 00:18:11.634
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

00:18:12.295 --> 00:18:14.855
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:16.455
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

00:18:16.775 --> 00:18:18.655
- Uh...
- Okay.

00:18:20.935 --> 00:18:24.215
You know, you really should
be kinder to your neighbors.

00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:26.055
You never know when
you're gonna need

00:18:26.135 --> 00:18:27.775
to borrow some sugar.

00:18:31.165 --> 00:18:32.798
Now, hang on a second.

00:18:32.908 --> 00:18:36.462
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

00:18:36.696 --> 00:18:39.656
making a mess of
your friend's house...

00:18:40.135 --> 00:18:41.455
It's a lovely home, miss.

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:42.775
Oh, my God!

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:44.933
What the hell?

00:18:48.615 --> 00:18:50.055
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

00:18:50.735 --> 00:18:53.135
Just don't kill me.

00:18:53.295 --> 00:18:55.095
That would really
complicate the situation.

00:18:55.255 --> 00:18:57.935
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

00:18:58.015 --> 00:18:59.295
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

00:18:59.455 --> 00:19:01.015
I'm sorry I simmed your boss.

00:19:01.175 --> 00:19:04.815
But now I stand before
you as my true self.

00:19:04.895 --> 00:19:05.975
Without deception.

00:19:06.215 --> 00:19:07.455
And who is that out there?

00:19:08.335 --> 00:19:10.502
Okay,
that's a fair point...

00:19:10.572 --> 00:19:12.494
but I'm sure that you understand

00:19:12.556 --> 00:19:14.666
I had to take some precautions.

00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:18.095
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

00:19:18.175 --> 00:19:19.423
with your hands bound.

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:20.652
I just wanna talk.

00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:21.695
Last time we talked,

00:19:21.775 --> 00:19:22.895
I ended up hanging
from my ankles.

00:19:23.055 --> 00:19:25.535
That was before I
knew who you were.

00:19:25.695 --> 00:19:28.815
Before I knew what made
you different from the others.

00:19:29.895 --> 00:19:31.975
I have an audio
recording from Pegasus...

00:19:32.175 --> 00:19:35.135
of your voice from a plane crash

00:19:35.215 --> 00:19:36.615
six years ago...

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:41.015
on a device I believe
you call a "black box."

00:19:41.535 --> 00:19:44.135
They told me it was
destroyed in the crash.

00:19:44.588 --> 00:19:45.384
How'd you get it?

00:19:45.455 --> 00:19:46.455
She don't understand.

00:19:46.655 --> 00:19:47.935
Young lady, I have
a special skill...

00:19:48.095 --> 00:19:49.535
that kind of allows me

00:19:49.615 --> 00:19:51.695
to get into places I'm
not supposed to be.

00:19:52.011 --> 00:19:53.051
Call me "young lady" again...

00:19:53.132 --> 00:19:54.412
I'm gonna put my foot in a place

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:55.933
it's not supposed to be.

00:19:58.005 --> 00:20:00.325
Am I supposed to
guess where that is?

00:20:00.855 --> 00:20:02.015
Your ass.

00:20:02.175 --> 00:20:04.655
Okay, I get it.
We're all a little on edge here.

00:20:04.815 --> 00:20:06.695
But, look, I just need your help

00:20:06.775 --> 00:20:07.975
decoding some coordinates.

00:20:08.135 --> 00:20:09.975
If you'll sit down and
you'll listen to this...

00:20:10.135 --> 00:20:13.335
I assure you, it'll
be worth your while.

00:20:16.015 --> 00:20:18.255
Call your buddy back
inside and I'll listen.

00:20:18.855 --> 00:20:19.855
Deal.

00:20:20.946 --> 00:20:22.826
Oh, my God! Get that thing away.

00:20:22.924 --> 00:20:24.244
How'd that get in here?

00:20:24.511 --> 00:20:25.631
Hmm?

00:20:27.055 --> 00:20:28.055
The cat?

00:20:28.175 --> 00:20:29.295
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

00:20:29.846 --> 00:20:30.966
That's not a cat.

00:20:31.975 --> 00:20:34.095
- That's a Flerken.
- A Flerken?

00:20:35.064 --> 00:20:35.978
Mom?

00:20:44.222 --> 00:20:46.662
<i>So, uh, how do we find the lab?</i>

00:20:46.822 --> 00:20:48.062
After we lost it
the first time...

00:20:48.222 --> 00:20:50.533
I put on a new tracker...

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:52.189
of sorts.

00:21:01.401 --> 00:21:02.801
That'll work.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.910
Is it ready or not?

00:21:31.366 --> 00:21:33.966
We can begin the
extraction process.

00:21:35.104 --> 00:21:36.104
Listen, Ava.

00:21:36.264 --> 00:21:37.984
This whole thing could
be very dangerous.

00:21:38.824 --> 00:21:39.984
Maybe we should...

00:21:40.144 --> 00:21:42.704
Maybe we should what? Wait?

00:21:42.864 --> 00:21:44.984
I've got days until I'm dead.

00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:48.664
We're doing this, Bill.
Now.

00:21:51.744 --> 00:21:54.824
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

00:21:55.024 --> 00:21:56.184
We don't have much time before

00:21:56.264 --> 00:21:57.384
Mom's location
shifts, and we lose her.

00:21:57.544 --> 00:21:59.384
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

00:22:00.064 --> 00:22:01.464
You know, my
pep-pep always said,

00:22:01.544 --> 00:22:03.384
"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."

00:22:03.544 --> 00:22:04.744
So, we should do that.

00:22:04.904 --> 00:22:07.024
One, we have to
break into that lab.

00:22:07.184 --> 00:22:09.624
Two, we have to kick
out Foster and Ghost.

00:22:09.824 --> 00:22:11.944
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

00:22:12.104 --> 00:22:14.504
That seems like it should be part of two.
2-A, all right?

00:22:14.704 --> 00:22:16.224
Let's call it 2-A.

00:22:16.424 --> 00:22:17.744
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

00:22:17.904 --> 00:22:19.464
Oh, also, we have to
make sure that the lab

00:22:19.544 --> 00:22:20.824
is fully grown for
you to come back.

00:22:20.984 --> 00:22:21.984
Otherwise, we're screwed.

00:22:22.144 --> 00:22:22.864
Scott!

00:22:23.024 --> 00:22:23.904
You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

00:22:24.064 --> 00:22:25.784
I'm going to dive.

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:29.767
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...

00:22:29.864 --> 00:22:32.984
together, protecting the tunnel.

00:22:33.584 --> 00:22:36.024
Let me do this, Hope.
Please.

00:22:37.464 --> 00:22:39.544
Let me get her.

00:22:40.904 --> 00:22:42.824
I think he's right.

00:22:49.984 --> 00:22:52.144
"Whassup?"

00:22:54.504 --> 00:22:56.864
You don't remember, uh,
that beloved commercial?

00:22:57.544 --> 00:22:58.944
"Whassup?"

00:23:00.024 --> 00:23:01.784
I had him follow us.

00:23:01.944 --> 00:23:04.824
I thought we could
use some help.

00:23:06.344 --> 00:23:07.624
All right. I'm in position.

00:23:07.704 --> 00:23:08.824
The ants are headed in.

00:23:08.984 --> 00:23:10.224
<i>Copy that.</i>

00:23:10.304 --> 00:23:11.464
<i>Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.</i>

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:14.464
- Do you want Pez?
- No.

00:23:15.184 --> 00:23:16.704
Cassie gave me
this for my birthday.

00:23:17.344 --> 00:23:19.304
By the way, I love that suit!

00:23:19.744 --> 00:23:21.424
Thanks, man.

00:23:22.024 --> 00:23:24.504
I wish I had a suit.

00:23:24.664 --> 00:23:28.824
I would even like a suit with
minimal powers, you know?

00:23:28.984 --> 00:23:32.664
Or maybe even just
a suit, with no powers.

00:23:47.584 --> 00:23:48.464
What is it?

00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:51.304
Don't know.

00:23:55.309 --> 00:23:56.389
It's them!

00:23:59.224 --> 00:24:00.304
They can't be far.

00:24:21.264 --> 00:24:24.064
All right, Hank. Hank?

00:24:26.504 --> 00:24:27.904
Dad, what's your status?

00:24:28.064 --> 00:24:29.984
Foster's taken care of.

00:24:30.144 --> 00:24:31.704
Suiting up now.

00:24:36.224 --> 00:24:37.864
I just wanted to save Ava.

00:24:38.024 --> 00:24:40.664
She's facing death or
something far more terrible.

00:24:40.824 --> 00:24:41.864
She's afraid.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.681
I'll help you find a
cure when I get back.

00:24:45.759 --> 00:24:46.900
I promise.

00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:50.224
Together, we'll
figure something out.

00:24:52.344 --> 00:24:53.944
Good luck, Hank.

00:24:54.424 --> 00:24:56.064
Thanks, Bill.

00:24:56.784 --> 00:24:59.424
Now, I'm gonna
need you to step back.

00:25:16.464 --> 00:25:19.944
<i>Time remaining, 15 minutes.</i>

00:25:21.584 --> 00:25:22.904
<i>Hank's in, Scott.</i>

00:25:23.104 --> 00:25:24.024
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

00:25:24.184 --> 00:25:25.304
No, nothing yet.

00:25:31.384 --> 00:25:32.464
Ava!

00:25:35.384 --> 00:25:37.344
Call off the ants, Scott.

00:25:37.504 --> 00:25:38.704
Oh, boy!

00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:03.281
Can I get a status report?

00:26:03.324 --> 00:26:05.142
'Cause I got some serious
Ghost problems here!

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.640
Ready to dive.

00:26:16.424 --> 00:26:18.424
- In case I don't make it...
<i>- Don't.</i>

00:26:18.784 --> 00:26:20.184
Don't say that.

00:26:20.689 --> 00:26:22.529
<i>I can't lose you, too.</i>

00:26:22.744 --> 00:26:24.024
I love you, Hope.

00:26:25.784 --> 00:26:27.864
Guys, everything's
bad over here.

00:26:44.104 --> 00:26:45.104
Now.

00:26:54.984 --> 00:26:56.224
Misdirection.

00:26:56.624 --> 00:26:57.904
One of the first
things they teach you

00:26:57.984 --> 00:27:00.344
at Online Close-up
Magic University.

00:27:02.464 --> 00:27:03.304
No!

00:27:06.744 --> 00:27:08.184
Plan worked. We got it, Scotty!

00:27:08.888 --> 00:27:10.338
Meet us at the rendezvous point.

00:27:10.504 --> 00:27:11.784
Okay, on my way!

00:27:12.349 --> 00:27:13.269
Oh, no.

00:27:16.664 --> 00:27:19.064
Really? This guy again?

00:27:19.264 --> 00:27:20.344
Who?

00:27:20.504 --> 00:27:22.504
I told you our
business wasn't over.

00:27:24.684 --> 00:27:25.924
Change of plans.

00:27:29.572 --> 00:27:30.372
Hang on.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.560
I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.

00:27:51.504 --> 00:27:52.224
Hold on.

00:28:06.264 --> 00:28:07.864
That undercarriage is filthy!

00:28:08.024 --> 00:28:09.464
Oh, they got bigger problems.

00:28:14.824 --> 00:28:15.904
Hope, what're you doing?

00:28:16.064 --> 00:28:17.304
You're heading away
from the rendezvous point!

00:28:17.464 --> 00:28:18.544
<i>Don't worry,</i>

00:28:18.624 --> 00:28:19.704
<i>I'm taking these guys
on the scenic route.</i>

00:28:19.904 --> 00:28:21.944
Wait, what're you...
Oh.

00:28:41.624 --> 00:28:43.584
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

00:28:44.344 --> 00:28:45.864
We're gonna die!

00:28:57.852 --> 00:28:59.772
<i>Signal lost.</i>

00:29:00.339 --> 00:29:02.659
What the hell are
they doing up there?

00:29:04.602 --> 00:29:05.962
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

00:29:21.697 --> 00:29:23.497
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

00:29:24.652 --> 00:29:28.332
You never said it
was so beautiful, Scott.

00:29:33.531 --> 00:29:35.131
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

00:29:38.968 --> 00:29:41.048
Okay, any time now.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.410
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

00:29:46.069 --> 00:29:47.789
<i>- Recalibrating.</i>
- Come on.

00:29:48.917 --> 00:29:51.277
<i>Signal restored.</i>

00:30:03.664 --> 00:30:05.224
Bikes, it's all you.

00:30:08.991 --> 00:30:10.551
- Take the wheel.
- What? Wait! Whoa.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:23.640
Well, the 60's were fun,
but now I'm paying for it.

00:30:23.794 --> 00:30:25.234
Be careful up there!

00:30:25.394 --> 00:30:27.514
Hey, give me a break!
I haven't driven in two years!

00:30:57.083 --> 00:30:58.603
Oh, you got pezed!

00:31:01.437 --> 00:31:02.225
Up here!

00:31:05.539 --> 00:31:06.539
Oh, that's not good.

00:31:10.713 --> 00:31:11.853
Hope!

00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:17.749
- No!
- No!

00:31:23.196 --> 00:31:24.316
There it is, right there.
Get the lab!

00:31:24.476 --> 00:31:25.516
Get the lab!

00:31:34.777 --> 00:31:36.977
I've got her.
Westbound on Fremont.

00:31:39.838 --> 00:31:41.716
Hope! Wait!

00:31:41.876 --> 00:31:43.356
Hey, what about me?

00:31:52.428 --> 00:31:53.748
We got you now, Ava!

00:31:54.302 --> 00:31:56.422
Whoa! Oh!

00:32:20.352 --> 00:32:21.712
Not again!

00:32:23.329 --> 00:32:24.729
Piece of junk!

00:32:28.215 --> 00:32:29.695
Ah! Yes!

00:32:31.796 --> 00:32:33.978
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.494
Burch got the lab.

00:32:37.953 --> 00:32:39.713
I'm going after him.

00:32:48.436 --> 00:32:49.836
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:32:53.127 --> 00:32:54.727
Work in progress, my ass...

00:33:10.228 --> 00:33:11.076
<i>Scott, where are you?</i>

00:33:11.156 --> 00:33:12.676
<i>I've got Burch in my sights.
Hurry!</i>

00:33:12.836 --> 00:33:13.916
I'm coming, I'm
coming, I'm coming!

00:33:14.076 --> 00:33:15.796
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

00:33:18.984 --> 00:33:21.584
<i>Warning, approaching
quantum void.</i>

00:33:47.656 --> 00:33:48.978
I'm coming to you, honey.

00:34:36.111 --> 00:34:36.996
Guys.

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:40.303
Don't you need the remote to the lab?
I just found it.

00:34:40.567 --> 00:34:41.687
We can't grow
the lab without it.

00:34:41.767 --> 00:34:42.927
Get it to us fast.

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:44.089
Yeah, but the van is busted.

00:34:44.196 --> 00:34:45.596
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

00:34:48.789 --> 00:34:49.789
What?

00:34:55.337 --> 00:34:56.916
I love you, Dr. Pym.

00:34:57.497 --> 00:34:58.775
The remote!
We're missing the remote!

00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.840
<i>You gotta check the van!</i>

00:35:03.307 --> 00:35:04.347
Huh?

00:35:07.666 --> 00:35:09.314
Awesome!

00:35:36.445 --> 00:35:37.365
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.

00:35:37.462 --> 00:35:38.662
<i>Burch's boys are all over me.</i>

00:35:38.744 --> 00:35:39.824
I'm on my way.

00:35:39.916 --> 00:35:41.956
Right.
I'll get the lab.

00:35:45.716 --> 00:35:46.716
Hi.

00:35:48.072 --> 00:35:49.192
Oh, that's badass!

00:35:58.289 --> 00:35:59.569
Nice.

00:36:09.074 --> 00:36:09.914
Doink!

00:36:15.304 --> 00:36:16.784
Come here, you little weasel!

00:36:16.927 --> 00:36:18.647
No, you don't!

00:36:21.476 --> 00:36:23.556
I guess maybe you do.

00:36:24.199 --> 00:36:25.416
Come on!

00:36:37.531 --> 00:36:40.611
Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?

00:36:44.883 --> 00:36:47.243
How'd he even have
time to buy a ticket?

00:36:49.095 --> 00:36:50.036
Would you just one time,

00:36:50.116 --> 00:36:51.516
please work!

00:36:52.596 --> 00:36:53.476
Yes!

00:36:53.956 --> 00:36:55.116
All right, I need help.

00:36:56.276 --> 00:36:57.356
Yes!

00:36:58.276 --> 00:37:00.596
Oh. Sorry.
Ah...

00:37:01.556 --> 00:37:02.436
Somebody!

00:37:02.596 --> 00:37:04.116
Hey! Come on, man!

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.636
Not cool!

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:08.370
Murderers!

00:37:09.236 --> 00:37:11.636
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:37:13.306 --> 00:37:16.314
I'm gonna call you
Ant-onio Banderas!

00:37:16.599 --> 00:37:17.919
You're a badass!

00:37:18.225 --> 00:37:19.705
Yes!

00:37:21.955 --> 00:37:22.998
No, no, no!

00:37:23.072 --> 00:37:24.672
Ant-onio!

00:37:27.158 --> 00:37:28.516
<i>Our friends, the humpbacks,</i>

00:37:28.596 --> 00:37:30.736
<i>dip in here to the
San Francisco Bay...</i>

00:37:30.806 --> 00:37:32.962
<i>for a little leisure
and a little breeding.</i>

00:37:33.011 --> 00:37:34.211
Listen, Uzman...

00:37:34.236 --> 00:37:36.356
<i>And perhaps they're down below
as we speak, doing the nasty.</i>

00:37:36.736 --> 00:37:38.400
Just meet me at the waterfront.

00:37:38.478 --> 00:37:39.396
In three hours.

00:37:39.556 --> 00:37:40.716
<i>Oh, folks.
We've barely left the dock...</i>

00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:42.589
<i>but it looks like we
got some company.</i>

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.181
<i>Look. Right there.
Do you see it, folks?</i>

00:37:47.237 --> 00:37:49.397
<i>There it is. There's a breach.</i>

00:37:50.941 --> 00:37:51.775
What the...?

00:37:56.956 --> 00:37:59.556
Hi. Sorry. Hi.

00:37:59.716 --> 00:38:01.916
It's okay. It's okay!

00:38:02.076 --> 00:38:04.676
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

00:38:04.836 --> 00:38:07.009
Hey! That doesn't belong to you!

00:38:07.427 --> 00:38:08.907
No, no! No, no!

00:38:08.994 --> 00:38:10.252
You're embarrassing
yourself now.

00:38:10.314 --> 00:38:13.041
- Come on. Let go.
- No!

00:38:13.116 --> 00:38:14.116
Thank you.

00:38:16.573 --> 00:38:18.293
I'll take this now.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.640
<i>It melts your mind.</i>

00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:38.901
<i>A message in your head.</i>

00:38:41.221 --> 00:38:42.381
<i>I had a dream.</i>

00:38:42.541 --> 00:38:44.221
<i>Daddy?
Where's Mommy?</i>

00:38:44.381 --> 00:38:45.821
<i>It's where I hid every
time that we played.</i>

00:38:45.981 --> 00:38:47.021
<i>I love you, Hank.</i>

00:39:03.621 --> 00:39:04.821
Daddy?

00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:10.621
Daddy?

00:39:13.661 --> 00:39:16.461
Dad?
What's going on?

00:39:16.621 --> 00:39:17.781
Why haven't you found Mom?

00:39:20.021 --> 00:39:22.701
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?

00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:27.101
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?

00:40:23.161 --> 00:40:24.961
It's me.

00:40:38.456 --> 00:40:40.416
I'm so sorry...

00:40:42.796 --> 00:40:43.983
it took so long.

00:40:44.096 --> 00:40:45.336
No.

00:40:46.901 --> 00:40:47.981
No.

00:40:48.701 --> 00:40:50.221
You're here now.

00:40:51.701 --> 00:40:52.981
Let's go home.

00:40:55.261 --> 00:40:56.701
I thought I was gone.

00:40:57.501 --> 00:41:00.461
But that energy
from your hands...

00:41:00.621 --> 00:41:02.021
how did you do that?

00:41:04.861 --> 00:41:07.821
I'm not the same woman I
was 30 years ago, Henry.

00:41:07.981 --> 00:41:09.461
This place...

00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:12.461
it changes you.

00:41:14.261 --> 00:41:17.461
Adaptation is part of
it, but some of it is...

00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:18.821
evolution.

00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:23.381
<i>Lab coordinates not found.</i>

00:41:23.701 --> 00:41:24.941
<i>Do not ascend.</i>

00:41:26.021 --> 00:41:27.301
I should probably tell you

00:41:27.381 --> 00:41:29.301
what we're dealing
with up there.

00:41:31.141 --> 00:41:33.821
I got the lab. I got the lab.

00:41:33.981 --> 00:41:36.261
Move. Move.

00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:38.901
Move!

00:41:39.301 --> 00:41:41.221
Get out of the way.

00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:47.981
Let's go.

00:41:49.701 --> 00:41:53.301
<i>No one here appears
to be sure what this is.</i>

00:41:53.461 --> 00:41:56.301
<i>It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.</i>

00:42:01.353 --> 00:42:03.353
Get out of the way!

00:42:04.181 --> 00:42:07.261
I got the lab.

00:42:08.975 --> 00:42:10.341
The air feels chunky.

00:42:10.501 --> 00:42:12.061
Oh, no. He's too big.

00:42:16.177 --> 00:42:17.137
Scotty!

00:42:17.343 --> 00:42:18.223
Scott!

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.021
I'm gonna go to sleep.

00:42:20.506 --> 00:42:23.061
I'm just gonna go to
sleep now for five minutes.

00:42:23.353 --> 00:42:24.873
I just need five minutes.

00:42:26.101 --> 00:42:27.221
Five minutes!

00:42:34.615 --> 00:42:35.855
You get the lab somewhere safe.

00:42:36.022 --> 00:42:38.622
- Scott's air won't last.
- Okay.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:54.500
Move!

00:42:54.582 --> 00:42:57.382
Move! Move!

00:42:59.334 --> 00:43:00.334
No, wait!

00:43:11.704 --> 00:43:13.344
<i>Lab at full scale.</i>

00:43:13.499 --> 00:43:14.459
They did it.

00:43:14.581 --> 00:43:15.821
<i>Ready to ascend.</i>

00:43:16.261 --> 00:43:17.901
Let's go see our daughter.

00:43:40.061 --> 00:43:41.101
Scott!

00:43:42.661 --> 00:43:43.981
Scott!

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:46.595
Scott, come on, wake up!

00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:02.821
Come on.
Come on, where are you, Scott?

00:44:05.499 --> 00:44:06.452
Gotcha.

00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:11.621
Scott?

00:44:18.426 --> 00:44:19.306
Hey.

00:44:22.341 --> 00:44:24.821
Hey, Scotty! Hope, come in.

00:44:25.043 --> 00:44:26.883
Did you get crushed
by the building?

00:44:30.101 --> 00:44:31.461
Where's the remote, Luis?

00:44:32.061 --> 00:44:33.741
It's probably in there.

00:44:34.581 --> 00:44:35.861
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

00:44:36.101 --> 00:44:37.821
I guess this is where we say...

00:44:38.501 --> 00:44:39.941
<i>Adiós, amigo.</i>

00:44:40.421 --> 00:44:42.021
No, no, no, no!

00:44:45.221 --> 00:44:46.181
Thanks, guys.

00:44:52.941 --> 00:44:53.941
Ava?

00:44:54.581 --> 00:44:56.061
Ava!

00:44:59.421 --> 00:45:00.421
Ava!

00:45:00.581 --> 00:45:01.941
Almost ready for extraction.

00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:04.341
Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!

00:45:04.541 --> 00:45:07.021
Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!

00:45:07.181 --> 00:45:08.781
What if Hank is right?

00:45:08.941 --> 00:45:10.621
What if this
process kills Janet?

00:45:10.781 --> 00:45:12.021
What, you're worried about her?

00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:14.101
All I'm saying is that
she is a brilliant scientist.

00:45:14.301 --> 00:45:15.501
She may be able to help.

00:45:15.661 --> 00:45:18.101
Oh, she will help.
Right now!

00:45:18.301 --> 00:45:20.101
And if she dies, she dies!

00:45:20.347 --> 00:45:23.077
No, no.
I'm sorry, we can't do this.

00:45:23.548 --> 00:45:25.548
We have to find another way.

00:45:28.301 --> 00:45:30.301
This is the way.

00:45:51.421 --> 00:45:52.701
Janet!

00:46:03.499 --> 00:46:05.026
She started the extraction.

00:46:05.128 --> 00:46:07.128
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:17.141
No!

00:46:51.461 --> 00:46:52.581
Hope!

00:47:09.832 --> 00:47:10.912
Are you okay?

00:47:25.621 --> 00:47:27.421
Mom?

00:47:35.608 --> 00:47:37.128
Oh, my God.

00:47:41.901 --> 00:47:43.461
We found you.

00:47:47.496 --> 00:47:49.256
I missed you so much.

00:47:49.741 --> 00:47:51.981
I missed you too, Jellybean.

00:47:54.701 --> 00:47:55.701
It's okay.

00:47:55.861 --> 00:47:58.861
I'm here now. We have time.

00:48:00.741 --> 00:48:02.901
No more last-minute
business trips, okay?

00:48:04.387 --> 00:48:05.341
I promise.

00:48:05.702 --> 00:48:06.702
No, it's okay!

00:48:06.738 --> 00:48:08.498
It's all right.
Just don't worry about me.

00:48:08.892 --> 00:48:10.652
- I'll be fine.
- Dad.

00:48:15.766 --> 00:48:17.366
Scott.

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:19.190
Miss Van Dyne.

00:48:20.501 --> 00:48:22.101
It's nice to...

00:48:22.261 --> 00:48:23.701
Well, I guess we've already met.

00:48:23.955 --> 00:48:26.315
Yeah.
I guess we have.

00:48:29.461 --> 00:48:30.301
Wait.

00:48:38.969 --> 00:48:40.329
Your pain.

00:48:42.147 --> 00:48:43.507
I can feel it.

00:48:45.941 --> 00:48:47.261
It hurts.

00:48:49.381 --> 00:48:51.261
It always hurts.

00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:55.661
I'm sorry.

00:48:58.781 --> 00:49:00.861
I think I can help you.

00:49:35.181 --> 00:49:37.141
Did you know she could do that?

00:49:40.381 --> 00:49:41.981
It's okay.

00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:45.758
Guys, the cops are coming!

00:49:46.211 --> 00:49:47.211
Whoa.

00:49:49.221 --> 00:49:52.061
The cops are coming.
Like, all of 'em!

00:49:52.695 --> 00:49:54.535
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go!

00:49:55.742 --> 00:49:57.022
What about them?

00:50:00.676 --> 00:50:01.653
Hands in the air!

00:50:01.795 --> 00:50:03.995
- No! We are going to our jobs.
- No.

00:50:04.061 --> 00:50:06.101
You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.

00:50:06.301 --> 00:50:09.501
So we apprehended them.
For you. You're welcome.

00:50:09.661 --> 00:50:11.661
We traffic in stolen technology.

00:50:11.821 --> 00:50:13.701
And we have killed
many, many people.

00:50:13.861 --> 00:50:15.341
Uh, he's in charge.

00:50:15.501 --> 00:50:16.501
That's true, I am.

00:50:17.598 --> 00:50:18.421
I've also committed

00:50:18.524 --> 00:50:21.074
numerous health code
violations in my restaurant.

00:50:21.172 --> 00:50:23.035
Some of them would shock you.

00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:28.693
It is truth serum.

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:34.230
We gotta get outta here.

00:50:34.344 --> 00:50:35.944
Fast.

00:50:37.064 --> 00:50:38.442
I have an idea.

00:50:38.861 --> 00:50:40.141
<i>Giant figure, now spotted</i>

00:50:40.221 --> 00:50:41.541
<i>at the intersection of
Broadway and Laguna.</i>

00:50:41.701 --> 00:50:42.741
<i>All units move in.</i>

00:50:42.941 --> 00:50:44.261
Go, go!

00:50:47.747 --> 00:50:49.187
There he is!

00:50:54.207 --> 00:50:55.543
It's over, Scotty!

00:50:55.863 --> 00:50:57.983
I'm sorry, but we got you, man!

00:50:58.698 --> 00:51:00.538
Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.

00:51:00.666 --> 00:51:01.986
There's nowhere to hide.

00:51:04.067 --> 00:51:07.227
Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's okay!

00:51:08.541 --> 00:51:11.021
Damn it, Scotty,
reduce yourself!

00:51:17.141 --> 00:51:18.741
Magic.

00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:22.049
Damn it!

00:51:22.123 --> 00:51:23.883
Get to Lang's, now!

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.360
Well done, honey.

00:51:33.011 --> 00:51:34.090
Let's go!

00:51:42.159 --> 00:51:43.159
Leave me here.

00:51:43.265 --> 00:51:44.345
We can make it.

00:51:44.622 --> 00:51:45.702
You said it yourself.

00:51:46.861 --> 00:51:48.861
I've hurt people.

00:51:49.061 --> 00:51:50.701
But you haven't.

00:51:50.901 --> 00:51:52.421
Go. Please!

00:51:52.581 --> 00:51:53.901
We can make it, Ava.

00:51:54.622 --> 00:51:56.062
Bill...

00:51:56.467 --> 00:51:58.027
I'm not leaving you.

00:52:42.023 --> 00:52:43.463
Oh, hey, guys.

00:52:43.786 --> 00:52:45.706
Are my two years up already?

00:52:52.482 --> 00:52:54.322
What's it like out there?

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:57.500
Huh? I mean,
do people still dance?

00:52:57.943 --> 00:53:00.023
Are food trucks still a thing?

00:53:00.095 --> 00:53:01.895
Well, you got away
with it this time, Scott...

00:53:01.985 --> 00:53:05.185
but, uh, I'll be
seeing you again.

00:53:05.461 --> 00:53:06.301
Where?

00:53:07.381 --> 00:53:08.221
Huh?

00:53:08.605 --> 00:53:10.205
Where will you be
seeing me again?

00:53:10.941 --> 00:53:14.221
Like, in general...

00:53:14.381 --> 00:53:16.221
The next time you
do something bad,

00:53:16.301 --> 00:53:18.356
- I'll be there to catch you...
- Oh.

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.231
You'll be watching...

00:53:20.325 --> 00:53:22.725
I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.

00:53:23.629 --> 00:53:24.821
Why would I do that?

00:53:25.193 --> 00:53:27.593
That's what I was wondering,
why would you do that?

00:53:27.684 --> 00:53:29.164
Like a party, or like,
dinner or something?

00:53:29.301 --> 00:53:31.221
I don't know.
I thought you planned the evening.

00:53:31.421 --> 00:53:32.661
I meant, "I'll arrest
you later, again."

00:53:32.741 --> 00:53:33.941
Of course, that
would be strange.

00:53:34.101 --> 00:53:35.901
- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- Okay.

00:53:37.246 --> 00:53:38.692
Did you want to grab
dinner, or something?

00:53:38.754 --> 00:53:40.701
I mean, because I'm free...

00:53:40.861 --> 00:53:42.221
Yeah. Come on.

00:53:44.502 --> 00:53:45.502
Monica.

00:53:45.545 --> 00:53:47.065
- Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!

00:54:14.987 --> 00:54:16.387
What's happening?

00:54:16.547 --> 00:54:18.147
It's loading.

00:54:21.987 --> 00:54:23.267
<i>Punch in the coordinates</i>

00:54:23.347 --> 00:54:27.747
<i>5-2-2-9, negative
4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.</i>

00:54:27.789 --> 00:54:29.749
<i>Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?</i>

00:54:30.027 --> 00:54:31.387
<i>My laboratory.</i>

00:54:31.587 --> 00:54:33.787
<i>Your laboratory?
What do you mean?</i>

00:54:33.947 --> 00:54:35.067
<i>Oh, no.</i>

00:54:35.227 --> 00:54:37.227
<i>Is that...
Wait, what is that?</i>

00:54:37.347 --> 00:54:38.747
<i>It's not showing up on my radar.</i>

00:54:38.907 --> 00:54:40.467
<i>Go, Carol. Fly!</i>

00:54:40.787 --> 00:54:43.159
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

00:54:43.227 --> 00:54:45.227
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

00:54:45.307 --> 00:54:46.307
Yes, ma'am.

00:54:52.427 --> 00:54:54.507
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

00:54:54.707 --> 00:54:56.227
I never should have
brought you along.

00:55:01.536 --> 00:55:02.536
Here come some G's.

00:55:21.987 --> 00:55:23.707
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.387
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

00:55:40.307 --> 00:55:41.427
Stay with me, Lawson!

00:55:59.707 --> 00:56:01.027
<i>Carol, come in. Do you copy?</i>

00:56:01.187 --> 00:56:03.627
Yeah, I copy. We hit ground.

00:56:03.787 --> 00:56:05.347
<i>Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?</i>

00:56:05.507 --> 00:56:07.667
Yeah! I copy.

00:56:10.427 --> 00:56:11.427
Doc?

00:56:12.552 --> 00:56:13.992
Your blood.

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:16.336
It's blue.

00:56:16.547 --> 00:56:19.707
Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:23.547
Help me out, will ya?

00:56:26.587 --> 00:56:29.667
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

00:56:29.827 --> 00:56:30.907
Lawson?

00:56:31.307 --> 00:56:35.067
You remember what I said
about our work here? What it's for?

00:56:36.107 --> 00:56:37.307
To end wars?

00:56:37.507 --> 00:56:41.107
Yeah. But the wars are
bigger than you know.

00:56:42.347 --> 00:56:43.787
Damn it!

00:56:44.427 --> 00:56:46.387
My name is not Lawson.

00:56:46.827 --> 00:56:49.867
My real name is Mar-Vell,

00:56:49.947 --> 00:56:52.747
and I come from a
planet called Hala.

00:56:54.107 --> 00:56:56.147
I would say that
you're delusional...

00:56:56.347 --> 00:56:57.947
but we just got shot
down by a spaceship

00:56:58.027 --> 00:56:59.507
and your blood is blue.

00:57:00.387 --> 00:57:04.227
Listen, I spent half my
life fighting a shameful war.

00:57:04.387 --> 00:57:06.227
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

00:57:06.307 --> 00:57:07.507
any more regrets.

00:57:07.707 --> 00:57:09.787
Just remember the
coordinates, okay?

00:57:10.347 --> 00:57:11.947
You gotta save 'em without me.

00:57:12.107 --> 00:57:13.147
Save who? How?

00:57:13.307 --> 00:57:16.187
Now I gotta blow this
engine before they find it.

00:57:16.347 --> 00:57:17.667
What are you doing?

00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:39.667
We have no interest
in hurting you.

00:57:40.067 --> 00:57:41.387
No?

00:57:41.547 --> 00:57:44.227
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

00:57:45.787 --> 00:57:47.227
The energy core.

00:57:48.067 --> 00:57:49.307
Where is it?

00:57:49.467 --> 00:57:51.187
Pararescue's on the way.

00:57:52.027 --> 00:57:53.907
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

00:57:54.227 --> 00:57:56.867
Then I see no reason to
prolong this conversation.

00:57:57.027 --> 00:57:58.067
No, wait!

00:58:04.507 --> 00:58:05.867
You mean that energy core?

00:58:10.427 --> 00:58:11.547
No!

00:58:55.187 --> 00:58:58.547
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

00:58:58.707 --> 00:58:59.707
Hold your fire.

00:59:09.707 --> 00:59:11.587
There's nothing left.

00:59:11.787 --> 00:59:13.427
The core has been destroyed.

00:59:23.027 --> 00:59:25.027
She absorbed its power.

00:59:27.307 --> 00:59:29.067
She's coming with us.

00:59:49.862 --> 00:59:51.222
He lied to me.

00:59:53.753 --> 00:59:55.713
Everything that
I knew was a lie.

00:59:55.873 --> 00:59:58.393
Now, you understand.

00:59:58.553 --> 01:00:01.033
What?
What do I understand now?

01:00:01.193 --> 01:00:03.073
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

01:00:03.273 --> 01:00:04.393
He killed her...

01:00:05.273 --> 01:00:07.033
'cause she found
out that she was

01:00:07.113 --> 01:00:10.353
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

01:00:10.433 --> 01:00:11.473
No.

01:00:12.073 --> 01:00:14.193
Your people are terrorists.

01:00:14.353 --> 01:00:15.833
They kill innocents.

01:00:16.033 --> 01:00:17.753
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

01:00:17.913 --> 01:00:21.193
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

01:00:21.553 --> 01:00:24.873
My people lived as
refugees on Torfa.

01:00:25.633 --> 01:00:28.633
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

01:00:28.793 --> 01:00:30.793
and they destroyed our planet.

01:00:30.953 --> 01:00:34.553
And the handful
of us that are left

01:00:34.633 --> 01:00:36.673
will be slaughtered next...

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:40.833
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

01:00:42.113 --> 01:00:43.553
The core that she found

01:00:43.633 --> 01:00:45.153
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

01:00:45.353 --> 01:00:47.113
capable of carrying
us to safety.

01:00:47.313 --> 01:00:51.273
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

01:00:52.753 --> 01:00:55.113
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:56.433
wasn't to fight wars...

01:00:56.593 --> 01:00:57.593
but to end them.

01:00:58.233 --> 01:01:03.753
She wanted you to
help us find the core.

01:01:04.798 --> 01:01:05.918
Well, I already destroyed it.

01:01:05.993 --> 01:01:07.513
No, you destroyed the engine.

01:01:07.673 --> 01:01:10.713
The core that powered
it is in a remote location.

01:01:10.873 --> 01:01:15.153
If you help us decode
those coordinates...

01:01:15.313 --> 01:01:16.873
we can find it.

01:01:18.837 --> 01:01:20.437
You'll use it to destroy us.

01:01:24.072 --> 01:01:25.553
We just want a home.

01:01:29.793 --> 01:01:35.033
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

01:01:35.193 --> 01:01:37.033
Can't you see it now?

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:38.553
You're not one of them.

01:01:41.593 --> 01:01:43.113
You don't know me.

01:01:44.621 --> 01:01:47.101
You have no idea who I am.

01:01:49.167 --> 01:01:51.407
I don't even know who I am!

01:01:52.835 --> 01:01:55.115
You are Carol Danvers.

01:01:56.317 --> 01:01:58.437
You are the woman
on that black box

01:01:58.485 --> 01:02:01.045
risking her life to
do the right thing.

01:02:02.837 --> 01:02:04.597
My best friend...

01:02:04.773 --> 01:02:07.693
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:09.197
when no one else did.

01:02:09.713 --> 01:02:14.793
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

01:02:15.054 --> 01:02:18.334
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

01:02:18.494 --> 01:02:21.574
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

01:02:22.459 --> 01:02:23.859
You hear me?

01:02:25.073 --> 01:02:26.873
Do you hear me?

01:02:34.113 --> 01:02:36.113
Come here. Come here, girl.

01:02:36.793 --> 01:02:38.193
I got you.

01:02:52.329 --> 01:02:53.169
You ready?

01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:54.329
Yeah!

01:02:56.209 --> 01:02:58.009
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:00.449
Oh!

01:03:01.169 --> 01:03:03.569
Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

01:03:04.209 --> 01:03:05.249
X-Con Security.

01:03:06.769 --> 01:03:07.729
Mr. Karapetyan?

01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:09.569
Yeah, you saw that?

01:03:10.529 --> 01:03:14.529
It would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

01:03:14.689 --> 01:03:16.209
I'll see you Thursday, 9:00 AM.
Okay.

01:03:17.049 --> 01:03:18.049
Yeah!

01:03:18.449 --> 01:03:21.089
That's how you close a deal!

01:03:49.249 --> 01:03:50.929
This is awesome.

01:03:51.729 --> 01:03:53.089
So, Cassie...

01:03:53.249 --> 01:03:54.809
what do you want to
be when you grow up?

01:03:55.249 --> 01:03:57.089
I wanna help people...

01:03:57.249 --> 01:03:58.369
like my dad.

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:00.369
Really?

01:04:01.729 --> 01:04:03.369
I wanted to be his partner.

01:04:03.569 --> 01:04:05.129
But he said he wants you.

01:04:06.129 --> 01:04:07.329
Is that so?

01:04:12.009 --> 01:04:13.369
Daddy!

01:04:14.209 --> 01:04:15.889
Whoa! Hold on.

01:04:16.089 --> 01:04:17.969
Move, get outta here!

01:04:18.169 --> 01:04:19.889
Scott, don't, don't, don't!

01:04:20.169 --> 01:04:22.369
Ow.

01:04:22.489 --> 01:04:24.209
Oh, gross!

01:04:24.369 --> 01:04:26.609
Ugh. I hate that moth dust!

01:04:26.969 --> 01:04:30.729
Go! Shoo! Shoo!
