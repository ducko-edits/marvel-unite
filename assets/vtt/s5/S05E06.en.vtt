WEBVTT

00:00:12.773 --> 00:00:14.093
I am Groot.

00:00:14.253 --> 00:00:15.373
Tinkle in the cup.

00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:16.813
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:19.133
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig before.

00:00:19.293 --> 00:00:20.373
I am Groot.

00:00:20.573 --> 00:00:21.613
Tree, pour what's in the cup

00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:23.173
out into space and
go in the cup again.

00:00:23.493 --> 00:00:24.693
You speak Groot?

00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:26.653
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:27.853
I am Groot.

00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:30.013
You'll know when we're close.

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:31.773
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

00:00:31.853 --> 00:00:34.053
the blazing power
of a neutron star.

00:00:36.893 --> 00:00:38.933
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.

00:00:39.613 --> 00:00:41.373
It's truly awesome.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:50.533
Okay, time to be the captain.

00:00:55.573 --> 00:00:57.093
So, dead brother, huh?

00:00:57.773 --> 00:00:59.613
Yeah, that could be annoying.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.973
Well, he's been dead before.

00:01:03.453 --> 00:01:05.973
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:08.773
And you said your
sister and your dad?

00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.253
Both dead.

00:01:10.853 --> 00:01:12.533
But still got a mom, though?

00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:14.293
Killed by a dark elf.

00:01:14.453 --> 00:01:15.453
A best friend?

00:01:15.573 --> 00:01:16.893
Stabbed through the heart.

00:01:20.293 --> 00:01:23.453
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

00:01:25.693 --> 00:01:27.173
Absolutely.

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.853
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...

00:01:31.013 --> 00:01:32.613
they're all
tremendous motivators.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:33.693
They really clear the mind.

00:01:33.853 --> 00:01:35.453
So I'm good to go.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.293
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:41.053
he's the toughest there is.

00:01:41.213 --> 00:01:43.253
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:44.973
He's never fought me twice.

00:01:45.613 --> 00:01:47.373
And I'm getting a new
hammer, don't forget.

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.773
It better be some hammer.

00:01:53.893 --> 00:01:56.293
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.013
I've killed twice as
many enemies as that.

00:01:59.173 --> 00:02:01.133
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

00:02:01.213 --> 00:02:02.213
but none succeeded.

00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:05.813
I'm only alive because
fate wants me alive.

00:02:05.973 --> 00:02:08.773
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:10.813
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

00:02:10.973 --> 00:02:12.773
Fate wills it so.

00:02:12.853 --> 00:02:14.173
Mmm-hmm.

00:02:14.253 --> 00:02:16.093
And what if you're wrong?

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:21.173
If I'm wrong, then...

00:02:22.453 --> 00:02:24.013
what more could I lose?

00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:39.213
I could lose a lot.

00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:41.413
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:46.213
Okay.

00:02:49.394 --> 00:02:51.474
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:53.253
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:55.413
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:58.173
Some jerk lost a bet
with me on Contraxia.

00:02:58.493 --> 00:02:59.613
He gave you his eye?

00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:00.893
No, he gave me 100 credits.

00:03:01.053 --> 00:03:04.013
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:07.173
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.253
Hmm.

00:03:10.813 --> 00:03:12.333
Huh?

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.173
Oh.

00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:18.173
I would've washed that.

00:03:18.253 --> 00:03:20.733
The only way I could sneak
it off Contraxia was up my...

00:03:22.093 --> 00:03:23.173
Hey, we're here!

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:28.293
I don't think this thing works.

00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:29.613
Everything seems dark.

00:03:32.093 --> 00:03:33.813
It ain't the eye.

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:48.533
Something's wrong.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:50.853
The star's gone out.

00:03:51.973 --> 00:03:53.253
And the rings are frozen.

00:04:14.413 --> 00:04:15.893
I hope these dwarves are better

00:04:15.973 --> 00:04:17.733
at forging than
they are cleaning.

00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:24.573
Maybe they
realized that they live

00:04:24.653 --> 00:04:26.053
in a junk pile in
the middle of space.

00:04:26.213 --> 00:04:29.173
This forge hasn't
gone dark in centuries.

00:04:31.493 --> 00:04:34.093
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?

00:04:34.293 --> 00:04:35.453
Yes, why?

00:04:35.613 --> 00:04:37.653
It look anything like that?

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:42.813
I am Groot.

00:04:42.973 --> 00:04:44.493
Go back to the pod.

00:04:48.493 --> 00:04:49.533
Eitri, wait!

00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:51.822
Stop!

00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:53.437
Stop.

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:55.594
Thor?

00:04:58.641 --> 00:05:00.041
What happened here?

00:05:00.293 --> 00:05:02.613
You were supposed to protect us.

00:05:03.626 --> 00:05:06.266
Asgard was
supposed to protect us.

00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:08.651
Asgard is destroyed.

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:14.715
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?

00:05:27.545 --> 00:05:30.545
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:34.849
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:38.769
I made what he wanted.

00:05:40.426 --> 00:05:44.786
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

00:05:49.393 --> 00:05:51.993
Then he killed everyone anyway.

00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:55.872
All except me.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.840
"Your life is yours," he said.

00:06:00.074 --> 00:06:04.034
"But your hands are mine alone."

00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:07.033
Eitri, this isn't
about your hands.

00:06:08.137 --> 00:06:09.737
Every weapon
you've ever designed,

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:11.249
every axe, hammer, sword...

00:06:11.417 --> 00:06:13.617
it's all inside your head.

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:16.378
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.

00:06:16.468 --> 00:06:18.028
Trust me, I know.

00:06:18.554 --> 00:06:23.274
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.

00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:48.585
The stone had
better be up there.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.490
For your sister's sake.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.130
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.490
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.810
You know us?

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.530
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.690
Where is the Soul Stone?

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.090
You should know...

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.850
it extracts a terrible price.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.770
I am prepared.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.650
We all think that at first.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.490
We are all wrong.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.450
How is it you know
this place so well?

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.930
A lifetime ago, I, too,
sought the stones.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.090
I even held one in my hand.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.330
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.530
Guiding others to a
treasure I cannot possess.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.170
What you seek
lies in front of you.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.250
As does what you fear.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.450
What's this?

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.530
The price.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.330
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.410
You might say it
has a certain wisdom.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.610
Tell me what it needs.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.330
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.050
understands its power...

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.730
the stone demands a sacrifice.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.450
Of what?

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.850
In order to take the stone,

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.330
you must lose
that which you love.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.570
A soul...

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.450
for a soul.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.530
All my life, I
dreamed of a day...

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.850
a moment...

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.290
when you got what you deserved.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.770
And I was always
so disappointed.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.850
But now...

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.890
You kill and torture...

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.850
and you call it mercy.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.010
The universe has judged you.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:15.050
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.090
You failed.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.370
And do you wanna know why?

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.170
Because you love nothing.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.490
No one.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.290
No.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:38.930
Really?

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.050
Tears?

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.810
They're not for him.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.290
No.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.210
This isn't love.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.730
I ignored my destiny once.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.370
I cannot do that again.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.250
Even for you.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.810
I'm sorry, little one.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.890
No!

00:14:03.022 --> 00:14:04.902
This is the plan?
We're gonna hit him with a brick?

00:14:05.062 --> 00:14:06.262
It's a mold.

00:14:07.022 --> 00:14:08.022
A king's weapon.

00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:11.302
Meant to be the
greatest in Asgard.

00:14:11.942 --> 00:14:14.822
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

00:14:14.982 --> 00:14:16.422
Did it have a name?

00:14:17.702 --> 00:14:18.862
Stormbreaker.

00:14:19.302 --> 00:14:20.462
That's a bit much.

00:14:22.502 --> 00:14:23.582
So how do we make it?

00:14:25.422 --> 00:14:27.622
You'll have to
restart the forge.

00:14:28.582 --> 00:14:30.782
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

00:14:33.422 --> 00:14:36.062
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

00:14:42.813 --> 00:14:45.653
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

00:14:45.782 --> 00:14:47.062
I hope you're right about this.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.320
Or we're gonna land a
lot faster than you want to.

00:15:06.172 --> 00:15:07.532
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda

00:15:07.612 --> 00:15:08.692
to the rest of the world...

00:15:08.892 --> 00:15:11.092
this is not what I imagined.

00:15:11.252 --> 00:15:13.212
And what did you imagine?

00:15:13.372 --> 00:15:14.532
The Olympics.

00:15:14.692 --> 00:15:16.412
Maybe even a Starbucks.

00:15:30.652 --> 00:15:32.012
Should we bow?

00:15:32.212 --> 00:15:33.452
Yeah, he's a king.

00:15:33.772 --> 00:15:35.772
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

00:15:37.773 --> 00:15:39.092
What are you doing?

00:15:39.172 --> 00:15:41.172
Uh, we don't do that here.

00:15:41.332 --> 00:15:43.572
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

00:15:43.732 --> 00:15:46.772
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.

00:15:46.932 --> 00:15:47.932
How we looking?

00:15:48.012 --> 00:15:49.972
You will have my Kingsguard,

00:15:50.052 --> 00:15:53.012
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...

00:15:53.972 --> 00:15:56.892
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.

00:15:59.772 --> 00:16:00.932
How you been, Buck?

00:16:01.092 --> 00:16:04.212
Uh, not bad, for
the end of the world.

00:16:16.292 --> 00:16:17.332
Whoa.

00:16:17.412 --> 00:16:19.492
The structure is polymorphic.

00:16:19.972 --> 00:16:22.812
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

00:16:23.252 --> 00:16:25.092
Why didn't you just reprogram

00:16:25.172 --> 00:16:27.292
the synapses to
work collectively?

00:16:28.372 --> 00:16:31.612
Because we didn't think of it.

00:16:32.052 --> 00:16:33.332
I'm sure you did your best.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:34.732
Can you do it?

00:16:35.652 --> 00:16:38.932
Yes, but there are more
than two trillion neurons here.

00:16:39.092 --> 00:16:42.252
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

00:16:42.652 --> 00:16:43.732
It will take time, brother.

00:16:45.452 --> 00:16:46.492
How long?

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:47.772
As long as you can give me.

00:16:52.452 --> 00:16:54.652
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

00:17:11.492 --> 00:17:13.812
Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.132
God, I love this place.

00:17:25.292 --> 00:17:26.932
Yeah, don't start
celebrating yet, guys.

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:28.932
We got more incoming
outside the dome.

00:17:48.172 --> 00:17:49.252
It's too late.

00:17:50.292 --> 00:17:51.532
We need to destroy
the stone now.

00:17:52.132 --> 00:17:53.732
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.

00:17:53.932 --> 00:17:55.252
We will hold them off.

00:17:55.412 --> 00:17:58.852
Wanda, as soon as that
stone's out of his head...

00:17:59.012 --> 00:18:00.012
you blow it to hell.

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:01.492
I will.

00:18:01.692 --> 00:18:04.452
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.

00:18:05.212 --> 00:18:06.692
And get this man a shield.

00:18:17.092 --> 00:18:18.212
<i>I don't think</i>

00:18:18.292 --> 00:18:19.412
<i>you get the scientifics here.</i>

00:18:19.572 --> 00:18:22.052
<i>These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...</i>

00:18:22.212 --> 00:18:23.572
<i>you're gonna need
something a lot bigger</i>

00:18:23.652 --> 00:18:24.692
<i>to yank 'em loose.</i>

00:18:24.852 --> 00:18:26.932
- Leave that to me.
<i>- Leave it to you?</i>

00:18:27.092 --> 00:18:30.212
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

00:18:38.612 --> 00:18:39.652
<i>Fire the engines!</i>

00:18:57.172 --> 00:18:59.852
More power, rabbit!

00:19:31.292 --> 00:19:33.092
Well done, boy.

00:19:34.892 --> 00:19:36.812
That's Nidavellir.

00:19:56.892 --> 00:19:57.892
Damn it.

00:19:58.292 --> 00:19:59.852
"Damn it"?
What's "damn it"?

00:20:00.012 --> 00:20:01.412
<i>The mechanism is crippled.</i>

00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:02.932
- What?
- With the iris closed,

00:20:03.012 --> 00:20:04.052
I can't heat the metal.

00:20:04.212 --> 00:20:05.492
How long will it
take to heat it?

00:20:05.972 --> 00:20:08.332
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?

00:20:10.332 --> 00:20:11.412
I'm gonna hold it open.

00:20:11.572 --> 00:20:12.692
That's suicide.

00:20:12.852 --> 00:20:15.252
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

00:20:25.092 --> 00:20:26.132
How we looking, Bruce?

00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:27.932
Yeah, I think I'm
getting the hang of it.

00:20:31.252 --> 00:20:33.332
Wow! This is amazing, man.

00:20:33.412 --> 00:20:35.332
It's like being the
Hulk without actually...

00:20:39.172 --> 00:20:41.372
<i>I'm okay. I'm okay.</i>

00:20:42.892 --> 00:20:43.892
I've got two heat signatures

00:20:43.972 --> 00:20:44.972
breaking through the tree line.

00:21:13.412 --> 00:21:15.612
Thank you for standing with us.

00:21:15.802 --> 00:21:17.002
Of course, brother.

00:21:37.612 --> 00:21:39.212
Where's your other friend?

00:21:39.972 --> 00:21:42.372
You will pay for
his life with yours.

00:21:43.372 --> 00:21:45.812
Thanos will have that stone.

00:21:46.332 --> 00:21:47.772
That's not gonna happen.

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:50.252
You are in Wakanda now.

00:21:50.412 --> 00:21:53.852
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

00:21:57.132 --> 00:21:59.012
We have blood to spare.

00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:11.972
They surrender?

00:22:12.772 --> 00:22:13.772
Not exactly.

00:22:40.772 --> 00:22:42.212
What the hell?

00:22:45.172 --> 00:22:46.812
Looks like we pissed her off.

00:22:57.572 --> 00:22:59.092
They're killing themselves.

00:23:35.332 --> 00:23:36.932
You see the teeth
on those things?

00:23:37.012 --> 00:23:38.012
All right, back up, Sam.

00:23:38.092 --> 00:23:39.092
You're gonna get
your wings singed.

00:23:51.612 --> 00:23:53.012
<i>Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter</i>

00:23:53.092 --> 00:23:54.172
<i>and get in behind us...</i>

00:23:54.332 --> 00:23:56.132
<i>there's nothing
between them and Vision.</i>

00:23:56.492 --> 00:23:58.252
Then we better keep
'em in front of us.

00:23:58.452 --> 00:23:59.772
How do we do that?

00:24:02.172 --> 00:24:03.772
We open the barrier.

00:24:06.052 --> 00:24:10.172
On my signal, open
North-West Section Seventeen.

00:24:10.492 --> 00:24:12.372
<i>Requesting
confirmation, My King.</i>

00:24:12.452 --> 00:24:14.132
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

00:24:14.292 --> 00:24:15.492
On my signal.

00:24:15.772 --> 00:24:17.652
This will be the end of Wakanda.

00:24:18.972 --> 00:24:22.372
Then it will be the
noblest ending in history.

00:24:35.252 --> 00:24:36.812
Wakanda forever!

00:24:49.728 --> 00:24:50.728
Now!

00:25:20.572 --> 00:25:21.972
How much longer, Shuri?

00:25:22.172 --> 00:25:23.692
I've barely begun, brother.

00:25:23.852 --> 00:25:25.692
You might want
to pick up the pace.

00:25:32.772 --> 00:25:34.612
Allfathers, give me strength.

00:25:34.812 --> 00:25:36.612
You understand, boy?

00:25:36.772 --> 00:25:39.772
You're about to take
the full force of a star.

00:25:40.732 --> 00:25:42.132
It'll kill you.

00:25:42.812 --> 00:25:45.012
Only if I die.

00:25:45.292 --> 00:25:46.292
Yes.

00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:49.572
That's what killing you means.

00:26:17.532 --> 00:26:19.452
Hold it!
Hold it, Thor!

00:27:09.932 --> 00:27:11.892
Thor!
Say something. Come on.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.030
Thor, you okay?

00:27:19.492 --> 00:27:20.772
I think he's dying.

00:27:20.932 --> 00:27:22.892
He needs the axe!

00:27:24.372 --> 00:27:25.692
Where's the handle?

00:27:28.732 --> 00:27:31.092
Tree, help me find the handle!

00:28:39.932 --> 00:28:42.132
There's too many of 'em!

00:29:08.652 --> 00:29:11.972
You guys are so screwed now!

00:29:15.332 --> 00:29:17.332
Bring me Thanos!

00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:51.612
Oh, yeah.

00:29:54.732 --> 00:29:56.732
You're much more of a Thanos.

00:29:59.052 --> 00:30:01.252
I take it the Maw is dead.

00:30:03.532 --> 00:30:05.972
This day extracts a heavy toll.

00:30:07.692 --> 00:30:09.852
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

00:30:10.332 --> 00:30:11.812
You may regret that.

00:30:12.652 --> 00:30:14.052
He brought you face-to-face

00:30:14.132 --> 00:30:15.532
with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.

00:30:18.692 --> 00:30:21.172
And where do you
think he brought you?

00:30:22.252 --> 00:30:24.972
Let me guess.
Your home?

00:30:29.332 --> 00:30:30.652
It was.

00:30:33.372 --> 00:30:34.812
And it was beautiful.

00:30:37.412 --> 00:30:39.892
Titan was like most planets.

00:30:40.052 --> 00:30:42.932
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

00:30:43.092 --> 00:30:46.372
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

00:30:47.372 --> 00:30:48.572
Genocide.

00:30:49.292 --> 00:30:53.372
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

00:30:54.692 --> 00:30:56.852
They called me a madman.

00:30:57.572 --> 00:30:59.812
And what I predicted
came to pass.

00:31:02.532 --> 00:31:04.532
Congratulations,
you're a prophet.

00:31:05.132 --> 00:31:06.332
I'm a survivor.

00:31:06.492 --> 00:31:08.732
Who wants to murder trillions.

00:31:08.892 --> 00:31:12.612
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

00:31:13.132 --> 00:31:17.852
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

00:31:19.932 --> 00:31:21.452
And then what?

00:31:22.772 --> 00:31:24.292
I'd finally rest...

00:31:25.052 --> 00:31:28.212
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

00:31:29.372 --> 00:31:32.892
The hardest choices
require the strongest wills.

00:31:33.732 --> 00:31:38.452
I think you'll find our
will equal to yours.

00:31:39.892 --> 00:31:40.852
Our?

00:31:46.972 --> 00:31:48.372
Piece of cake, Quill.

00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:50.812
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.

00:32:28.972 --> 00:32:30.172
Boom!

00:32:30.412 --> 00:32:33.132
Don't let him close his fist.

00:32:37.332 --> 00:32:38.332
Magic.

00:32:38.972 --> 00:32:39.972
More magic.

00:32:40.812 --> 00:32:41.812
Magic with a kick.

00:32:42.452 --> 00:32:43.452
Magic with a...

00:32:44.772 --> 00:32:46.052
Insect!

00:33:23.492 --> 00:33:24.612
Well, well.

00:33:24.772 --> 00:33:25.812
You should've killed me.

00:33:25.972 --> 00:33:27.692
It would've been
a waste of parts!

00:33:33.332 --> 00:33:34.452
Where's Gamora?

00:34:15.772 --> 00:34:16.812
 Is he under? Don't let up.

00:34:16.972 --> 00:34:19.612
Be quick. He is very strong.

00:34:19.772 --> 00:34:21.812
Parker, help! Get over here.

00:34:21.972 --> 00:34:24.332
She can't hold him much longer.
Let's go.

00:34:29.812 --> 00:34:30.772
We gotta open his
fingers to get it off.

00:34:30.972 --> 00:34:32.092
I thought you'd
be hard to catch.

00:34:32.172 --> 00:34:33.372
For the record,
this was my plan.

00:34:34.692 --> 00:34:36.412
You're not so strong now, huh?

00:34:36.932 --> 00:34:38.692
Where is Gamora?

00:34:38.772 --> 00:34:40.732
My Gamora.

00:34:40.892 --> 00:34:42.932
No, bullshit!

00:34:43.212 --> 00:34:44.532
Where is she?

00:34:45.612 --> 00:34:46.892
He is in anguish.

00:34:47.612 --> 00:34:49.612
Good.

00:34:49.692 --> 00:34:52.012
He...
He mourns.

00:34:52.572 --> 00:34:56.212
What does this
monster have to mourn?

00:34:56.892 --> 00:34:57.972
Gamora.

00:35:01.852 --> 00:35:02.852
What?

00:35:03.292 --> 00:35:04.772
He took her to Vormir.

00:35:05.412 --> 00:35:07.372
He came back
with the Soul Stone.

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:09.652
But she didn't.

00:35:11.572 --> 00:35:14.772
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

00:35:15.612 --> 00:35:19.092
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

00:35:20.636 --> 00:35:21.636
Tell me she's lying.

00:35:23.812 --> 00:35:26.612
Asshole, tell me
you didn't do it!

00:35:28.052 --> 00:35:31.492
I had to.

00:35:32.212 --> 00:35:33.652
No, you didn't.

00:35:33.732 --> 00:35:35.532
No, you didn't.

00:35:39.372 --> 00:35:40.692
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

00:35:40.852 --> 00:35:42.652
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

00:35:43.372 --> 00:35:44.372
Hey, stop! Stop!

00:35:44.492 --> 00:35:46.332
It's coming, it's coming.
I got it, I got it!

00:35:49.652 --> 00:35:50.652
Oh, God.

00:36:50.239 --> 00:36:52.532
Come and get some, space dogs!

00:36:55.852 --> 00:36:58.452
Come on! Get some! Get some!

00:36:58.612 --> 00:37:00.532
Come on! Get some!

00:37:00.772 --> 00:37:02.812
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

00:37:03.452 --> 00:37:05.332
Okay. How much for the arm?

00:37:07.212 --> 00:37:09.212
Oh, I'll get that arm.

00:37:18.092 --> 00:37:19.092
New haircut?

00:37:19.452 --> 00:37:20.772
Noticed you've copied my beard.

00:37:23.372 --> 00:37:25.132
By the way, this is a
friend of mine, Tree.

00:37:26.052 --> 00:37:27.972
I am Groot.

00:37:28.972 --> 00:37:30.412
I am Steve Rogers.

00:37:50.492 --> 00:37:52.652
Fall back! Fall back, now!

00:38:02.092 --> 00:38:03.812
Focus that fire on
the left flank, Sam.

00:38:04.372 --> 00:38:05.492
I'm doing it.

00:38:29.412 --> 00:38:31.012
Why was she up
there all this time?

00:38:31.972 --> 00:38:34.852
She's on the field. Take it.

00:39:06.492 --> 00:39:08.612
Guys, we got a
Vision situation here.

00:39:11.372 --> 00:39:12.732
Somebody get to Vision!

00:39:13.492 --> 00:39:15.292
- I got him!
- On my way.

00:39:20.652 --> 00:39:23.492
He'll die alone. As will you.

00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:24.972
She's not alone.

00:39:51.212 --> 00:39:52.892
Oh, no, you don't.

00:39:53.092 --> 00:39:54.532
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:57.012
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.

00:39:57.172 --> 00:39:58.172
What? No! No!

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:04.612
Guys! Vision needs backup, now!

00:40:06.612 --> 00:40:08.212
Hulk? Hulk,

00:40:08.292 --> 00:40:10.212
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.

00:40:10.372 --> 00:40:13.012
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

00:40:17.492 --> 00:40:19.012
Hulk! Hulk!

00:40:19.892 --> 00:40:20.892
Hulk!

00:40:22.052 --> 00:40:24.212
No!

00:40:24.412 --> 00:40:27.132
Oh, screw you, you
big, green asshole!

00:40:27.332 --> 00:40:28.532
I'll do it myself!

00:40:29.452 --> 00:40:31.292
Come on! Yeah!

00:40:44.201 --> 00:40:45.155
See ya!

00:40:56.772 --> 00:40:59.252
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

00:41:10.332 --> 00:41:12.212
I thought you were
formidable, machine.

00:41:13.172 --> 00:41:15.692
But you're dying, like any man.

00:41:24.292 --> 00:41:25.532
Get outta here!

00:41:28.972 --> 00:41:30.012
Go!

00:41:48.732 --> 00:41:50.412
That was really gross.

00:42:17.572 --> 00:42:18.652
I thought I told you to go.

00:42:20.212 --> 00:42:22.172
We don't trade lives, Captain.

00:42:33.452 --> 00:42:35.492
I got you. I got you.

00:42:35.732 --> 00:42:37.732
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

00:43:23.012 --> 00:43:24.492
You're full of tricks, wizard.

00:43:26.626 --> 00:43:29.546
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.

00:43:32.932 --> 00:43:33.932
A fake.

00:43:41.892 --> 00:43:45.332
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

00:43:45.492 --> 00:43:46.692
Stark.

00:43:46.852 --> 00:43:47.932
You know me?

00:43:48.572 --> 00:43:49.692
I do.

00:43:50.212 --> 00:43:53.372
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

00:43:54.292 --> 00:43:55.612
My only curse is you.

00:43:58.212 --> 00:43:59.172
Come on!

00:44:26.952 --> 00:44:28.912
All that for a drop of blood.

00:45:13.132 --> 00:45:14.932
You have my respect, Stark.

00:45:16.612 --> 00:45:19.812
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

00:45:25.332 --> 00:45:27.412
I hope they remember you.

00:45:37.493 --> 00:45:38.613
Stop.

00:45:44.705 --> 00:45:45.745
Spare his life...

00:45:47.295 --> 00:45:49.055
and I will give you the stone.

00:45:52.732 --> 00:45:54.012
No tricks.

00:45:58.812 --> 00:45:59.812
Don't.

00:46:51.252 --> 00:46:52.932
One to go.

00:47:02.852 --> 00:47:04.252
Where is he?

00:47:13.212 --> 00:47:14.612
Did we just lose?

00:47:18.532 --> 00:47:20.452
Why would you do that?

00:47:23.772 --> 00:47:26.012
We're in the endgame now.

00:47:50.812 --> 00:47:53.412
Are you okay?

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:57.092
What? What is it?

00:47:59.252 --> 00:48:00.372
He's here.

00:48:11.412 --> 00:48:14.452
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.

00:48:17.212 --> 00:48:19.172
What the hell?

00:48:44.692 --> 00:48:45.692
Cap.

00:48:46.452 --> 00:48:47.892
That's him.

00:48:49.932 --> 00:48:52.532
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

00:49:17.012 --> 00:49:18.012
Wanda.

00:49:19.132 --> 00:49:20.452
It's time.

00:49:20.612 --> 00:49:21.612
No.

00:49:21.772 --> 00:49:23.972
They can't stop him,
Wanda, but we can.

00:49:24.132 --> 00:49:25.572
Look at me.

00:49:25.732 --> 00:49:26.892
You have the power
to destroy the stone.

00:49:26.972 --> 00:49:27.972
Don't.

00:49:28.052 --> 00:49:29.172
You must do it. Wanda, please.

00:49:31.172 --> 00:49:33.772
We are out of time.

00:49:34.572 --> 00:49:35.692
I can't.

00:49:35.852 --> 00:49:37.292
Yes, you can.

00:49:37.932 --> 00:49:39.212
You can.

00:49:40.692 --> 00:49:43.012
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

00:49:45.372 --> 00:49:46.892
It's not fair.

00:49:48.092 --> 00:49:49.652
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

00:49:51.612 --> 00:49:53.092
It's all right.

00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:56.212
You could never hurt me.

00:50:05.252 --> 00:50:07.052
I just feel you.

00:51:30.172 --> 00:51:31.332
It's all right.

00:51:41.252 --> 00:51:42.572
It's all right.

00:51:46.932 --> 00:51:48.012
I love you.

00:52:17.332 --> 00:52:19.452
I understand, my child.

00:52:20.972 --> 00:52:22.612
Better than anyone.

00:52:24.292 --> 00:52:26.212
You could never.

00:52:31.052 --> 00:52:34.052
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:38.452
But now is no time to mourn.

00:52:40.732 --> 00:52:44.732
Now is no time at all.

00:53:08.052 --> 00:53:09.052
No!

00:54:07.012 --> 00:54:08.452
I told you...

00:54:09.892 --> 00:54:11.692
you'd die for that.

00:54:26.012 --> 00:54:27.772
You should have...

00:54:30.412 --> 00:54:31.852
You should...

00:54:34.372 --> 00:54:37.612
You should have
gone for the head.

00:54:39.532 --> 00:54:40.532
No!

00:55:13.972 --> 00:55:15.172
Daughter?

00:55:22.772 --> 00:55:24.172
Did you do it?

00:55:26.092 --> 00:55:27.092
Yes.

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:37.092
What did it cost?

00:55:40.812 --> 00:55:42.292
Everything.

00:55:52.572 --> 00:55:54.132
What did you do?

00:55:55.372 --> 00:55:56.852
What'd you do?

00:56:10.492 --> 00:56:11.892
Where'd he go?

00:56:14.812 --> 00:56:15.812
Thor.

00:56:19.172 --> 00:56:20.812
Where'd he go?

00:56:20.972 --> 00:56:22.212
Steve?

00:56:57.052 --> 00:56:59.332
Up, General. Up!

00:56:59.932 --> 00:57:01.332
This is no place to die.

00:57:16.412 --> 00:57:17.972
I am Groot.

00:57:18.092 --> 00:57:19.612
Oh...

00:57:20.492 --> 00:57:22.572
No, no, no!

00:57:23.412 --> 00:57:26.252
Groot! No.

00:57:39.692 --> 00:57:40.852
Sam!

00:57:44.892 --> 00:57:46.532
Sam, where you at?

00:57:55.852 --> 00:57:58.092
Something's happening.

00:58:10.212 --> 00:58:11.372
Quill?

00:58:18.772 --> 00:58:19.932
Steady, Quill.

00:58:20.092 --> 00:58:21.212
Oh, man.

00:58:25.412 --> 00:58:26.412
Tony.

00:58:29.932 --> 00:58:32.412
There was no other way.

00:58:38.052 --> 00:58:39.092
Mr. Stark?

00:58:43.532 --> 00:58:44.852
I don't feel so good.

00:58:46.972 --> 00:58:47.972
You're all right.

00:58:48.052 --> 00:58:49.132
I don't...
I don't know what's happening.

00:58:49.212 --> 00:58:50.772
I don't know...

00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:53.572
I don't want to go.

00:58:53.652 --> 00:58:55.372
I don't want to go, sir. Please.

00:58:55.532 --> 00:58:58.252
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

00:59:02.812 --> 00:59:04.292
I'm sorry.

00:59:19.172 --> 00:59:20.612
He did it.

00:59:45.372 --> 00:59:48.612
What is this?
What the hell is happening?

01:00:05.492 --> 01:00:07.252
Oh, God.
