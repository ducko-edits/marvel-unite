WEBVTT

00:00:19.328 --> 00:00:20.328
Do we know if she had family?

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.648
Yeah.

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:23.848
Us.

00:00:25.248 --> 00:00:26.288
What?

00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:28.168
Huh?

00:00:28.248 --> 00:00:29.488
- What are you doing?
- Just asked him a question.

00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:30.848
Yeah, no, you're
acting like she's dead.

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:32.128
Why are we acting
like she's dead?

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:33.448
We have the stones, right?

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:34.648
As long as we have the stones...

00:00:34.808 --> 00:00:36.568
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:38.728
So, stop this shit.
We're the Avengers. Get it together.

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:40.088
Can't get her back.

00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:44.368
What's he...? What?

00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:45.728
It can't be undone.

00:00:46.328 --> 00:00:48.008
It can't.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.888
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.648
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

00:00:53.808 --> 00:00:55.128
And we're talking
about space magic.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.288
And "can't" seems very definitive.
Don't you think?

00:00:57.448 --> 00:00:58.808
Yeah, look, I know
that I'm way outside

00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:00.288
my pay grade here.

00:01:00.448 --> 00:01:01.928
But she still
isn't here, is she?

00:01:02.088 --> 00:01:03.088
No, that's my point.

00:01:03.248 --> 00:01:06.208
It can't be undone.

00:01:06.368 --> 00:01:07.808
Or that's at least

00:01:07.888 --> 00:01:09.688
what the red, floating
guy had to say.

00:01:09.888 --> 00:01:11.328
Maybe you wanna
go talk to him, okay?

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:14.568
Go grab your hammer and
you go fly and you talk to him.

00:01:23.088 --> 00:01:25.128
It was supposed to be me.

00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:29.688
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:31.328
She bet her life on it.

00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:38.568
She's not coming back.

00:01:40.368 --> 00:01:41.808
We have to make it worth it.

00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:43.848
We have to.

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:46.968
We will.

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:12.768
Boom!

00:02:18.448 --> 00:02:19.888
All right, the glove's ready.

00:02:20.688 --> 00:02:23.288
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

00:02:23.448 --> 00:02:25.528
- I'll do it.
- Excuse me?

00:02:25.648 --> 00:02:26.688
It's okay.

00:02:26.768 --> 00:02:27.768
Stop, stop. Slow down.

00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:29.368
Thor. Just wait.

00:02:29.528 --> 00:02:31.368
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:33.328
I'm sorry.
What, we're all just sitting around

00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:34.648
waiting for the
right opportunity?

00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:35.968
We should at least discuss it.

00:02:36.128 --> 00:02:38.088
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

00:02:38.168 --> 00:02:39.968
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:42.528
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay?

00:02:42.608 --> 00:02:43.928
So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

00:02:44.088 --> 00:02:45.288
- Normally, you're right.
- It's my duty.

00:02:45.488 --> 00:02:47.248
- It's not about that.
- It's not that.

00:02:47.448 --> 00:02:49.208
- Hey, buddy...
- Stop it! Just let me.

00:02:52.248 --> 00:02:53.728
Just let me do it.

00:02:53.888 --> 00:02:56.408
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

00:02:56.568 --> 00:02:57.568
Look, it's not just the fact...

00:02:57.728 --> 00:02:58.848
that that glove is
channeling enough energy

00:02:58.928 --> 00:02:59.848
to light up a continent.

00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:02.008
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:05.248
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:06.448
Cheez Whiz?

00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:10.008
Lightning.

00:03:10.168 --> 00:03:11.288
- Yeah.
- Lightning.

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:12.848
Lightning won't help you, pal.

00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:14.848
It's gotta be me.

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:18.328
You saw what those
stones did to Thanos.

00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:20.048
They almost killed him.

00:03:21.448 --> 00:03:23.328
None of you could survive.

00:03:24.048 --> 00:03:25.688
How do we know you will?

00:03:25.848 --> 00:03:26.888
We don't.

00:03:27.168 --> 00:03:29.728
But the radiation's
mostly gamma.

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:34.808
It's like...

00:03:36.688 --> 00:03:38.608
I was made for this.

00:03:57.528 --> 00:03:59.048
Good to go, yeah?

00:04:01.168 --> 00:04:02.168
Let's do it.

00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:03.728
Okay, remember,

00:04:03.808 --> 00:04:05.368
everyone Thanos snapped
away five years ago...

00:04:05.568 --> 00:04:08.008
you're just bringing
them back to now, today.

00:04:08.168 --> 00:04:09.608
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:12.168
Got it.

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:29.808
<i>Friday, do me a favor</i>

00:04:29.928 --> 00:04:31.368
<i>and activate Barn
Door Protocol, will ya?</i>

00:04:31.528 --> 00:04:32.808
<i> Yes, boss.</i>

00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:43.248
Everybody comes home.

00:05:06.648 --> 00:05:08.088
Take it off! Take it off!

00:05:08.248 --> 00:05:09.368
No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

00:05:09.448 --> 00:05:11.728
<i> Talk to me, Banner.</i>

00:05:14.928 --> 00:05:15.928
I'm okay.

00:05:16.408 --> 00:05:17.688
I'm okay.

00:05:49.168 --> 00:05:50.288
Bruce!

00:05:52.048 --> 00:05:53.608
Don't move him.

00:06:00.488 --> 00:06:02.488
- Did it work?
- We're not sure. It's okay.

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:49.888
Honey.

00:06:50.048 --> 00:06:51.008
<i>Clint?</i>

00:06:51.168 --> 00:06:52.408
Honey.

00:06:53.248 --> 00:06:54.608
Guys...

00:06:57.048 --> 00:06:58.448
I think it worked.

00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:14.461
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:17.501
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:25.941
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here.

00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:28.661
Let me up! Let me up!

00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:30.141
Come on!

00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:41.141
Rhodey!

00:08:42.901 --> 00:08:44.021
Huh?

00:08:49.661 --> 00:08:51.381
<i>Mayday, Mayday!
Does anybody copy?</i>

00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:52.701
<i>We're on the lower level.
It's flooding!</i>

00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:54.581
What? What?

00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:56.941
<i>We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!</i>

00:08:57.101 --> 00:08:59.261
Wait! I'm here!

00:08:59.421 --> 00:09:00.941
I'm here. Can you hear me?

00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:21.781
Cap?

00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:46.901
Okay.

00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:07.301
Daughter.

00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:08.621
Yes, Father.

00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:12.221
So, this is the future.

00:10:12.861 --> 00:10:13.701
Well done.

00:10:14.621 --> 00:10:16.141
Thank you, Father.

00:10:16.301 --> 00:10:17.661
They suspected nothing.

00:10:20.021 --> 00:10:21.461
The arrogant never do.

00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:25.541
Go.

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:28.941
Find the stones,
bring them to me.

00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:30.821
What will you do?

00:10:32.141 --> 00:10:33.821
Wait.

00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:00.701
Tell me something.

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.261
In the future...

00:11:04.421 --> 00:11:06.301
what happens to you and me?

00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:10.221
I try to kill you.

00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:13.461
Several times.

00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:16.501
But eventually...

00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:18.621
we become friends.

00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:21.821
We become sisters.

00:11:29.501 --> 00:11:30.701
Come on.

00:11:32.741 --> 00:11:34.541
We can stop him.

00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:43.981
Come on, buddy, wake up!

00:11:44.061 --> 00:11:45.981
That's my man.

00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:48.941
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:53.661
What happened?

00:11:53.821 --> 00:11:55.941
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

00:11:56.101 --> 00:11:56.981
You'll see.

00:12:19.101 --> 00:12:20.461
What's he been doing?

00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:23.781
Absolutely nothing.

00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:27.421
Where are the stones?

00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:29.621
Somewhere under all this.

00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:33.221
All I know is he
doesn't have 'em.

00:12:33.381 --> 00:12:35.141
So, we keep it that way.

00:12:35.301 --> 00:12:36.701
You know it's a trap, right?

00:12:36.861 --> 00:12:38.181
Yeah.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:39.701
I don't much care.

00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:41.461
Good.

00:12:42.421 --> 00:12:44.901
Just as long as
we're all in agreement.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.840
Let's kill him
properly this time.

00:13:06.061 --> 00:13:08.981
You could not live
with your own failure.

00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:12.301
Where did that bring you?

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:17.141
Back to me.

00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:23.381
I thought by
eliminating half of life...

00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:26.541
the other half would thrive.

00:13:26.701 --> 00:13:28.021
But you've shown me...

00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:30.941
that's impossible.

00:13:32.861 --> 00:13:36.181
And as long as there are
those that remember what was...

00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:37.821
there will always be those

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.541
that are unable to
accept what can be.

00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:43.541
They will resist.

00:13:44.061 --> 00:13:45.981
Yep, we're all
kinds of stubborn.

00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:48.461
I'm thankful.

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:52.381
Because now...

00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:54.701
I know what I must do.

00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:58.101
I will shred this universe...

00:13:58.261 --> 00:14:00.301
down to its last atom.

00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:02.781
And then...

00:14:02.941 --> 00:14:05.261
with the stones you've
collected for me...

00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:08.181
create a new one...

00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:10.581
teeming with life...

00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:12.621
that knows not
what it has lost...

00:14:12.781 --> 00:14:15.141
but only what it has been given.

00:14:18.261 --> 00:14:19.661
A grateful universe.

00:14:20.221 --> 00:14:21.621
Born out of blood.

00:14:21.781 --> 00:14:23.461
They'll never know it.

00:14:24.661 --> 00:14:27.581
Because you won't
be alive to tell them.

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:43.461
See you on the other side, man.

00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:47.821
Hang on!
I'm coming!

00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:19.101
Yeah!

00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:35.541
Oh, hey.

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:37.421
I know you.

00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:41.341
Father...

00:15:42.101 --> 00:15:43.501
I have the stones.

00:15:43.661 --> 00:15:44.581
What?

00:15:45.941 --> 00:15:46.901
Stop.

00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:53.501
You're betraying us?

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:00.821
You don't have to do this.

00:16:03.661 --> 00:16:06.141
I am this.

00:16:06.301 --> 00:16:08.221
No, you're not.

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.581
You've seen what we become.

00:16:16.661 --> 00:16:18.861
Nebula, listen to her.

00:16:20.341 --> 00:16:21.221
You can change.

00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:29.381
He won't let me.

00:16:31.021 --> 00:16:31.741
No!

00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:52.781
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

00:17:09.421 --> 00:17:10.701
<i>Boss, wake up!</i>

00:18:02.021 --> 00:18:03.301
I knew it!

00:19:26.005 --> 00:19:28.805
In all my years of conquest...

00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:31.541
violence...

00:19:32.621 --> 00:19:34.581
slaughter...

00:19:35.701 --> 00:19:38.101
it was never personal.

00:19:40.701 --> 00:19:42.781
But I'll tell you now...

00:19:44.781 --> 00:19:48.581
what I'm about to
do to your stubborn,

00:19:48.661 --> 00:19:51.061
annoying little planet...

00:19:52.781 --> 00:19:54.981
I'm gonna enjoy it...

00:19:55.941 --> 00:19:58.501
very, very much.

00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:03.301
<i>Hey, Cap, you read me?</i>

00:21:09.341 --> 00:21:11.621
<i>Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?</i>

00:21:15.621 --> 00:21:17.061
<i>On your left.</i>

00:22:42.701 --> 00:22:44.021
Is that everyone?

00:22:44.181 --> 00:22:46.381
What? You wanted more?

00:23:12.963 --> 00:23:14.923
Avengers...

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.030
assemble.

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:57.541
Die!

00:24:18.181 --> 00:24:20.941
No, no, give me that.
You have the little one.

00:24:34.621 --> 00:24:35.461
Hey!

00:24:36.461 --> 00:24:37.461
Holy cow!

00:24:37.621 --> 00:24:38.981
You will not believe
what's been going on.

00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:40.301
Do you remember
when we were in space?

00:24:40.461 --> 00:24:41.821
And I got all dusty?

00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:43.061
And I must've passed out,

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:44.661
because I woke up
and you were gone.

00:24:44.821 --> 00:24:46.461
But Doctor Strange was there, right?
And he was like...

00:24:46.621 --> 00:24:48.141
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us."

00:24:48.301 --> 00:24:49.861
And then he started doing
the yellow sparkly thing

00:24:49.981 --> 00:24:50.981
- that he does all the time.
- He did? Oh, no.

00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:53.461
What are you doing?
Oh.

00:24:57.461 --> 00:24:58.981
Oh, this is nice.

00:25:20.944 --> 00:25:21.944
Gamora?

00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:32.821
I thought I lost you.

00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:37.341
Ow.

00:25:37.421 --> 00:25:40.341
Don't touch me!

00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:45.181
You missed the first time.

00:25:45.341 --> 00:25:47.341
Then you got 'em
both the second time.

00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:50.421
This is the one?

00:25:50.621 --> 00:25:51.621
Seriously?

00:25:51.781 --> 00:25:53.781
Your choices were him or a tree.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.581
Cap!

00:26:05.741 --> 00:26:07.501
What do you want me to
do with this damn thing?

00:26:10.221 --> 00:26:12.261
Get those stones as
far away as possible!

00:26:12.421 --> 00:26:13.461
No!

00:26:14.621 --> 00:26:16.581
We need to get 'em back
where they came from.

00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:17.781
No way to get 'em back.

00:26:17.861 --> 00:26:19.341
Thanos destroyed
the quantum tunnel.

00:26:19.501 --> 00:26:20.341
Hold on!

00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:24.341
That wasn't our
only time machine.

00:26:30.341 --> 00:26:32.261
Anyone see an ugly
brown van out there?

00:26:32.821 --> 00:26:35.901
Yes! But you're not gonna
like where it's parked!

00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:38.181
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

00:26:39.421 --> 00:26:40.581
Uh, maybe 10 minutes.

00:26:40.741 --> 00:26:42.261
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

00:26:42.421 --> 00:26:43.941
We're on it, Cap.

00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:54.821
Hey.

00:26:55.021 --> 00:26:58.021
You said one out of 14
million, we win, yeah?

00:26:58.941 --> 00:26:59.941
Tell me this is it.

00:27:00.341 --> 00:27:02.221
If I tell you what happens...

00:27:02.381 --> 00:27:03.541
it won't happen.

00:27:07.406 --> 00:27:08.406
You better be right.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.160
It's a mess back here.

00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:19.941
It's dead.

00:27:21.221 --> 00:27:22.741
- What?
- It's dead.

00:27:22.901 --> 00:27:24.341
I have to hot-wire it.

00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:28.621
Where's Nebula?

00:27:29.631 --> 00:27:30.991
She's not responding.

00:27:31.461 --> 00:27:32.781
Sire...

00:27:42.541 --> 00:27:43.821
Clint!

00:27:45.861 --> 00:27:46.981
Give it to me.

00:28:09.261 --> 00:28:12.621
You took everything from me.

00:28:12.981 --> 00:28:15.341
I don't even know who you are.

00:28:15.501 --> 00:28:17.141
You will.

00:28:39.525 --> 00:28:40.485
I got it!

00:28:43.061 --> 00:28:44.141
Activate Instant Kill.

00:29:07.581 --> 00:29:08.941
Rain fire!

00:29:09.621 --> 00:29:11.541
But, sire, our troops!

00:29:11.741 --> 00:29:13.461
Just do it!

00:29:33.621 --> 00:29:36.021
<i>Uh, is anyone else seeing this?</i>

00:29:49.941 --> 00:29:51.061
I got this!

00:29:51.301 --> 00:29:53.101
I got this.
Okay, I don't got this.

00:29:53.421 --> 00:29:54.581
<i>Help, somebody help!</i>

00:29:54.781 --> 00:29:56.661
Hey, Queens, heads up!

00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:07.741
Hang on. I got you, kid.

00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:12.541
Hey! Nice to meet you...

00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:14.541
Oh, my God!

00:30:50.781 --> 00:30:52.261
What the hell is this?

00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:54.101
Friday, what are they firing at?

00:30:54.301 --> 00:30:56.181
<i>Something just entered
the upper atmosphere.</i>

00:31:09.421 --> 00:31:11.581
Oh, yeah!

00:31:31.501 --> 00:31:33.901
Danvers, we need an assist here.

00:31:42.661 --> 00:31:45.261
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

00:31:45.861 --> 00:31:47.301
Hey, Peter Parker.

00:31:47.461 --> 00:31:48.621
You got something for me?

00:31:54.781 --> 00:31:56.861
I don't know how you're
gonna get it through all of that.

00:31:58.501 --> 00:31:59.941
Don't worry.

00:32:00.821 --> 00:32:02.381
She's got help.

00:34:50.181 --> 00:34:53.701
I am inevitable.

00:35:13.821 --> 00:35:15.381
And I...

00:35:17.061 --> 00:35:18.221
am...

00:35:21.941 --> 00:35:23.421
Iron Man.

00:37:22.141 --> 00:37:23.861
Mr. Stark?

00:37:24.261 --> 00:37:26.381
Hey!

00:37:26.501 --> 00:37:29.461
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

00:37:29.621 --> 00:37:31.181
It's Peter.

00:37:32.461 --> 00:37:34.101
Hey.

00:37:35.141 --> 00:37:38.181
We won, Mr. Stark.

00:37:40.021 --> 00:37:42.181
We won, Mr. Stark.

00:37:43.821 --> 00:37:46.661
We won!
You did it, sir, you did it.

00:37:47.101 --> 00:37:48.861
I'm sorry.

00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:50.021
Tony.

00:38:03.701 --> 00:38:04.741
Hey.

00:38:04.941 --> 00:38:06.741
Hey, Pep.

00:38:11.061 --> 00:38:12.141
Friday?

00:38:12.301 --> 00:38:15.061
<i>Life functions critical.</i>

00:38:23.661 --> 00:38:24.661
Tony?

00:38:25.901 --> 00:38:26.981
Look at me.

00:38:29.661 --> 00:38:31.581
We're gonna be okay.

00:38:36.301 --> 00:38:38.181
You can rest now.

00:40:23.701 --> 00:40:26.501
<i>Everybody wants a
happy ending, right?</i>

00:40:26.661 --> 00:40:28.861
<i>But it doesn't
always roll that way.</i>

00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:32.621
<i>Maybe this time.</i>

00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:36.861
<i>I'm hoping if you
play this back...</i>

00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:39.861
<i>it's in celebration.</i>

00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:44.781
<i>I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.</i>

00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:46.541
<i>And something
like a normal version</i>

00:40:46.621 --> 00:40:48.901
<i>of the planet has been restored.</i>

00:40:49.061 --> 00:40:51.021
<i>If there ever was such a thing.</i>

00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:54.581
<i>God, what a world.
Universe, now.</i>

00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:57.541
<i>If you told me 10 years
ago that we weren't alone...</i>

00:40:57.741 --> 00:40:59.741
<i>let alone to this
extent, I mean,</i>

00:40:59.821 --> 00:41:01.381
<i>I wouldn't have
been surprised...</i>

00:41:01.541 --> 00:41:03.181
<i>but come on, who knew?</i>

00:41:03.341 --> 00:41:06.141
<i>The epic forces of
darkness and light</i>

00:41:06.221 --> 00:41:07.981
<i>that have come into play.</i>

00:41:08.141 --> 00:41:09.861
<i>And for better or worse...</i>

00:41:10.021 --> 00:41:11.701
<i>that's the reality
Morgan's gonna</i>

00:41:11.781 --> 00:41:14.181
<i>have to find a
way to grow up in.</i>

00:41:17.461 --> 00:41:18.181
<i>So, I thought I'd probably</i>

00:41:18.261 --> 00:41:19.261
<i>better record a
little greeting...</i>

00:41:19.421 --> 00:41:23.061
<i>in the case of an untimely death.
On my part.</i>

00:41:23.221 --> 00:41:26.461
<i>Not that death at
any time isn't untimely.</i>

00:41:27.661 --> 00:41:29.021
<i>This time travel
thing that we're gonna</i>

00:41:29.101 --> 00:41:30.701
<i>try and pull off tomorrow...</i>

00:41:30.901 --> 00:41:31.861
<i>it's got me scratching my head</i>

00:41:31.981 --> 00:41:33.101
<i>about the
survivability of it all.</i>

00:41:33.261 --> 00:41:34.701
<i>That's the thing.</i>

00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:38.581
<i>Then again, that's
the hero gig, right?</i>

00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:39.861
<i>Part of the journey is the end.</i>

00:41:41.861 --> 00:41:42.861
<i>What am I even tripping for?</i>

00:41:43.021 --> 00:41:44.101
<i>Everything is gonna work out</i>

00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:47.101
<i>exactly the way
it's supposed to.</i>

00:41:50.621 --> 00:41:52.261
<i>I love you 3,000.</i>

00:44:07.221 --> 00:44:09.661
You know, I wish there was a way

00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:10.941
that I could let her know.

00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:15.581
That we won.

00:44:16.981 --> 00:44:18.661
We did it.

00:44:22.261 --> 00:44:24.061
She knows.

00:44:28.941 --> 00:44:31.021
They both do.

00:44:43.332 --> 00:44:44.532
Come on, Fanny.

00:45:46.603 --> 00:45:48.003
So...

00:45:48.243 --> 00:45:50.443
when can we expect you back?

00:45:52.003 --> 00:45:53.843
Um, about that...

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:56.470
Thor, your people need a king.

00:45:56.591 --> 00:45:58.471
No, they already have one.

00:46:00.443 --> 00:46:01.443
That's funny.

00:46:07.043 --> 00:46:08.883
Are you being serious?

00:46:12.523 --> 00:46:14.803
It's time for me
to be who I am...

00:46:15.363 --> 00:46:17.963
rather than who
I'm supposed to be.

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:21.003
But you, you're a leader.

00:46:21.643 --> 00:46:23.323
That's who you are.

00:46:25.843 --> 00:46:27.803
You know, I'd make a lot
of changes around here.

00:46:27.963 --> 00:46:29.483
I'm counting on it...

00:46:29.643 --> 00:46:31.123
Your Majesty.

00:46:41.283 --> 00:46:42.483
What will you do?

00:46:43.243 --> 00:46:44.643
I'm not sure.

00:46:44.803 --> 00:46:46.883
For the first time
in a thousand years,

00:46:46.963 --> 00:46:48.363
I have no path.

00:46:48.523 --> 00:46:49.963
I do have a ride though.

00:46:50.123 --> 00:46:52.083
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

00:46:56.563 --> 00:46:58.123
Oh, here we are!

00:46:58.563 --> 00:47:00.123
Tree, good to see you.

00:47:04.723 --> 00:47:08.003
The Asgardians of the
Galaxy back together again.

00:47:08.403 --> 00:47:10.323
Where to first?

00:47:11.443 --> 00:47:12.483
Hey.

00:47:13.083 --> 00:47:15.043
Just so you know,
this is my ship still.

00:47:15.203 --> 00:47:16.243
I'm in charge.

00:47:16.763 --> 00:47:19.323
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

00:47:19.483 --> 00:47:21.003
Of course.

00:47:23.643 --> 00:47:26.203
See, you say, "Of course,"
but then you touch the map.

00:47:26.363 --> 00:47:27.403
It makes you think that maybe

00:47:27.483 --> 00:47:28.883
you didn't realize
I was in charge.

00:47:29.483 --> 00:47:30.803
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.

00:47:31.003 --> 00:47:32.003
Quail?

00:47:32.155 --> 00:47:34.395
Okay? I am merely trying to
be of service and assisting.

00:47:34.563 --> 00:47:35.803
Quill.

00:47:35.963 --> 00:47:36.843
That's what I said.

00:47:37.003 --> 00:47:39.363
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:40.923
Sounds fair.

00:47:43.683 --> 00:47:46.043
- It's not necessary, okay?
- It's not.

00:47:46.203 --> 00:47:47.203
I got some blasters,

00:47:47.283 --> 00:47:48.603
unless you guys
wanna use knives.

00:47:48.763 --> 00:47:50.963
Oh, yes! Please, use knives.

00:47:51.123 --> 00:47:52.203
Yeah. Knives.

00:47:52.403 --> 00:47:53.923
I am Groot.

00:47:59.683 --> 00:48:01.043
Not necessary.

00:48:01.243 --> 00:48:02.683
There shall be no
knifing one another.

00:48:02.843 --> 00:48:05.843
Everybody knows who's in charge.

00:48:09.443 --> 00:48:10.643
Me.

00:48:12.176 --> 00:48:13.016
Right?

00:48:13.483 --> 00:48:15.683
Yes, you.

00:48:15.963 --> 00:48:18.363
Of course! Of course.

00:48:18.523 --> 00:48:20.203
Of course.

00:48:21.963 --> 00:48:23.483
Remember...

00:48:24.323 --> 00:48:25.523
you have to return the stones

00:48:25.643 --> 00:48:26.643
to the exact moment
you got 'em...

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:27.803
or you're gonna open up

00:48:27.883 --> 00:48:30.003
a bunch of nasty
alternative realities.

00:48:30.163 --> 00:48:31.163
Don't worry, Bruce.

00:48:31.723 --> 00:48:33.603
Clip all the branches.

00:48:34.123 --> 00:48:35.883
You know, I tried.

00:48:37.163 --> 00:48:39.203
When I had the
gauntlet, the stones,

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:41.403
I really tried to
bring her back.

00:48:44.683 --> 00:48:46.323
I miss her, man.

00:48:46.683 --> 00:48:47.683
Me too.

00:48:51.763 --> 00:48:54.203
You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

00:48:56.803 --> 00:48:58.243
You're a good man, Sam.

00:48:58.803 --> 00:49:00.323
This one's on me, though.

00:49:04.803 --> 00:49:06.723
Don't do anything
stupid till I get back.

00:49:08.563 --> 00:49:09.803
How can I?

00:49:09.963 --> 00:49:11.763
You're taking all
the stupid with you.

00:49:19.363 --> 00:49:21.123
Gonna miss you, buddy.

00:49:21.523 --> 00:49:23.003
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

00:49:30.403 --> 00:49:32.203
How long is this gonna take?

00:49:32.443 --> 00:49:35.203
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

00:49:40.283 --> 00:49:41.523
You ready, Cap?

00:49:41.683 --> 00:49:44.123
All right, we'll meet
you back here, okay?

00:49:44.803 --> 00:49:45.923
You bet.

00:49:47.403 --> 00:49:49.003
Going quantum. Three...

00:49:49.603 --> 00:49:50.403
two...

00:49:51.083 --> 00:49:52.283
one.

00:49:54.163 --> 00:49:56.203
And returning in five...

00:49:56.403 --> 00:49:57.363
four...

00:49:57.523 --> 00:49:59.363
three, two...

00:49:59.523 --> 00:50:00.843
one.

00:50:08.083 --> 00:50:09.123
Where is he?

00:50:09.283 --> 00:50:11.043
I don't know.
He blew right by his time stamp.

00:50:11.203 --> 00:50:12.643
He should be here.

00:50:18.163 --> 00:50:19.083
Get him back.

00:50:19.243 --> 00:50:20.363
- I'm trying.
- Get him the hell back.

00:50:20.523 --> 00:50:22.403
- Hey, I said I'm trying.
- Sam.

00:50:46.403 --> 00:50:47.963
Go ahead.

00:51:05.963 --> 00:51:06.723
Cap?

00:51:09.043 --> 00:51:10.803
Hi, Sam.

00:51:13.943 --> 00:51:16.983
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

00:51:18.963 --> 00:51:22.803
Well, after I put the
stones back, I thought...

00:51:23.923 --> 00:51:25.283
maybe...

00:51:25.763 --> 00:51:30.563
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

00:51:32.563 --> 00:51:34.683
How'd that work out for ya?

00:51:37.203 --> 00:51:38.603
It was beautiful.

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:41.643
Good. I'm happy for you.

00:51:41.843 --> 00:51:42.883
Truly.

00:51:43.603 --> 00:51:44.923
Thank you.

00:51:46.243 --> 00:51:47.483
Only thing bumming me out...

00:51:47.683 --> 00:51:49.243
is the fact I have
to live in a world

00:51:49.323 --> 00:51:51.243
without Captain America.

00:51:51.843 --> 00:51:53.003
Oh.

00:51:55.043 --> 00:51:57.843
That reminds me.

00:52:06.363 --> 00:52:07.563
Try it on.

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.563
How does it feel?

00:52:37.163 --> 00:52:38.883
Like it's someone else's.

00:52:41.923 --> 00:52:43.083
It isn't.

00:52:56.443 --> 00:52:58.003
Thank you.

00:52:59.723 --> 00:53:01.043
I'll do my best.

00:53:06.403 --> 00:53:08.323
That's why it's yours.

00:53:10.043 --> 00:53:11.403
You wanna tell me about her?

00:53:18.003 --> 00:53:19.523
No.

00:53:19.923 --> 00:53:22.043
No, I don't think I will.

00:54:22.532 --> 00:54:25.532

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:56.250
A-mark.

00:58:58.312 --> 00:58:59.726
And action.

00:59:00.312 --> 00:59:02.796

Wide-out the whole frame.

I can't go to Germany.
You know, I've got homework.

01:00:07.933 --> 01:00:09.747
Are you Tony Stank?

01:00:10.918 --> 01:00:12.487
<i>Not only did I not think</i>

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.961
<i>I would be doing a cameo
in such a big movie,</i>

01:00:16.258 --> 01:00:18.679
I never dreamt there'd be
such a big movie.

01:00:22.638 --> 01:00:25.604
<i>First thing I thought is,
there's gonna be little kids</i>

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:27.254
<i>trying to dress up like this...</i>

01:00:29.354 --> 01:00:30.882
on Halloween.
That's the first,

01:00:31.056 --> 01:00:34.510
literally, the first thing
I thought, was like, "Oh, wow."

01:00:38.339 --> 01:00:40.413
<i>You're looking at yourself
in this old makeup</i>

01:00:40.466 --> 01:00:42.375
<i>and you're trying
to tap into Steve's journey,</i>

01:00:42.402 --> 01:00:44.024
but you can't help
but think about your own

01:00:44.068 --> 01:00:46.611
and think about what this entire
experience has meant to you.

01:00:46.655 --> 01:00:48.495
<i>It's just been littered
with so many good memories.</i>

01:00:48.695 --> 01:00:51.012
They never want to work,
these kids, but I'll get them there.

01:00:51.204 --> 01:00:54.468
This has been such an
incredible chapter in my life.

01:00:55.422 --> 01:00:57.453
To work with creative people,

01:00:57.801 --> 01:01:02.722
<i>especially people who
make movies, is such a thrill.</i>

01:01:03.296 --> 01:01:06.472
<i>It's overwhelming
when I think about it.</i>

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:11.151
<i>And I keep saying to myself,
"I can't believe this is me.</i>

01:01:11.603 --> 01:01:14.203
"I can't believe
I lucked out this way."

01:01:14.624 --> 01:01:16.304
Ladies and gentleman,

01:01:16.499 --> 01:01:17.853
that is a wrap!
