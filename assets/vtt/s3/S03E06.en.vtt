00:00:19.212 --> 00:00:20.572
Darren, hi.

00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:23.452
Hope, where are you right now?

00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:25.252
I'm at home. Why?

00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:27.092
<i>I just saw Hank.</i>

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:29.012
<i>I still get nothing but
contempt from him.</i>

00:00:29.092 --> 00:00:32.612
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:35.212
<i>We need to start everyone
working around the clock.</i>

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:37.092
<i>Get the assembly
line up and running.</i>

00:00:37.212 --> 00:00:38.452
<i>And I'm tripling security.</i>

00:00:38.532 --> 00:00:40.532
Full sensors at all entrances

00:00:40.612 --> 00:00:44.012
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

00:00:44.132 --> 00:00:45.732
Great. Good idea.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:50.132
<i>Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.</i>

00:00:52.532 --> 00:00:57.052
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

00:00:57.132 --> 00:00:59.092
But he is not onto you.

00:00:59.172 --> 00:01:01.492
He's adding full body
scanners to all entrances

00:01:01.612 --> 00:01:03.332
and closing exterior vents.

00:01:03.412 --> 00:01:05.372
How are we gonna
get Scott inside?

00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:08.412
The water main.

00:01:09.532 --> 00:01:11.452
You can't add security
to a water main.

00:01:11.532 --> 00:01:13.812
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:15.132
that's how I get in.

00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:17.412
Somebody would have to
reach the building's control center

00:01:17.492 --> 00:01:18.812
to change the water pressure.

00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:20.252
Hank and I will be beside Cross.

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:21.652
How are we supposed to do that?

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:23.252
So we expand our team.

00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:24.812
What do we need?

00:01:24.892 --> 00:01:26.572
A fake security
guard on the inside

00:01:26.692 --> 00:01:28.332
to de-pressurize
the water system,

00:01:28.412 --> 00:01:30.212
somebody else to hack
in to the power supply

00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:31.732
and kill the laser grid,

00:01:31.852 --> 00:01:34.132
and a getaway guy.

00:01:34.212 --> 00:01:38.172
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three wombats. No way.

00:01:38.772 --> 00:01:40.212
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:43.932
It's not too often that you rob a
place and then get welcomed back.

00:01:44.012 --> 00:01:45.892
Because we just robbed you.

00:01:47.452 --> 00:01:51.012
You know that he was arrested for
stealing a smoothie machine, right?

00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:52.332
Two smoothie machines.

00:01:52.452 --> 00:01:54.012
Are you sure they
can handle this?

00:01:54.092 --> 00:01:55.532
Oh, we can handle it.
We're professionals.

00:01:55.612 --> 00:01:59.212
You'll forgive us if we're
not instilled with confidence.

00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:01.972
Well, hey, everybody just kick
back and relax a little bit, man.

00:02:02.052 --> 00:02:03.372
We know our business.

00:02:03.452 --> 00:02:05.812
We broke into this
spooky-ass house, didn't we?

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.332
I let you.

00:02:07.412 --> 00:02:10.692
Well, one could say
that I let you let me.

00:02:10.772 --> 00:02:12.372
Look, it's okay.
They can handle this.

00:02:12.492 --> 00:02:14.052
Yeah, we can handle it.

00:02:14.132 --> 00:02:15.892
- You got their credentials?
- He's in the system.

00:02:15.972 --> 00:02:17.172
I'm in the system?

00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:18.492
You're in the system.

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:19.692
The system?

00:02:19.812 --> 00:02:22.132
Yeah, we're doomed.

00:02:22.212 --> 00:02:23.212
All right.

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:25.012
There's something
you guys need to see.

00:02:25.092 --> 00:02:26.892
When you get to this corner,

00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:29.732
there's gonna be three
offices on your left side.

00:02:29.812 --> 00:02:31.132
Damn!

00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:35.572
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:38.332
Now, look, this is
gonna get weird, all right?

00:02:38.412 --> 00:02:39.972
It's pretty freaky,
but it's safe.

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:41.652
There's no reason to be scared.

00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:43.052
Oh, no, no.
Daddy don't get scared.

00:02:43.132 --> 00:02:44.972
Really? Yeah.

00:02:45.052 --> 00:02:46.172
Good.

00:02:53.332 --> 00:02:55.252
This is the work of gypsies.

00:02:55.332 --> 00:02:56.492
That's witchcraft.

00:02:56.572 --> 00:02:57.692
Wow, that's amazing.

00:02:58.332 --> 00:02:59.812
That's like some
David Copperfield shit.

00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:00.972
That's some kind of wizardry.

00:03:01.052 --> 00:03:02.172
This is sorcery!

00:03:02.252 --> 00:03:03.372
How'd you do that, bro?

00:03:03.452 --> 00:03:05.372
Don't freak out.
Look at your shoulder.

00:03:05.932 --> 00:03:07.212
Ahhh!

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:08.732
Get off! Get off!

00:03:08.812 --> 00:03:11.332
Wait, I thought Daddy
didn't get scared!

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.150
I gave them each half a Xanax

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.870
and Hank explained the
science of the suit to them.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.110
They fell right asleep.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.390
Hey, look, I wanna
thank you for...

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.390
No, please don't.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.630
We're all doing this for reasons

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.910
much bigger than any one of us.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.830
I'm just glad that
you might have

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.790
a slight chance of
maybe pulling this off.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.950
Hey, thank you, you
know, for that pep talk.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.750
You know, the honest truth is, I
actually went from despising you

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.430
to almost liking you.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.230
You really should write poetry.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.270
Get some sleep, Scott.

00:05:06.552 --> 00:05:08.192
<i>You betray me?</i>

00:05:09.112 --> 00:05:10.112
Steal my money?

00:05:10.192 --> 00:05:11.672
Stop it! Leave him alone!

00:05:12.192 --> 00:05:14.272
When I picked you up as a kid,

00:05:14.392 --> 00:05:16.672
these boys wanted to eat you.

00:05:16.832 --> 00:05:19.352
They ain't never
tasted Terran before.

00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:21.232
I saved your life!

00:05:21.312 --> 00:05:23.432
Oh, will you shut up about that?
God!

00:05:23.552 --> 00:05:25.792
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

00:05:25.872 --> 00:05:28.632
like it's some great
thing, not eating me.

00:05:28.712 --> 00:05:32.392
Normal people don't even
think about eating someone else!

00:05:32.552 --> 00:05:34.872
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

00:05:35.232 --> 00:05:36.352
You abducted me, man.

00:05:37.352 --> 00:05:39.552
You stole me from my
home and from my family.

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:41.752
You don't give a
damn about your Terra!

00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:43.392
You're scared

00:05:43.512 --> 00:05:45.592
because you're soft in here.

00:05:45.672 --> 00:05:46.712
Here, right here!

00:05:47.232 --> 00:05:48.232
Yondu!

00:05:48.352 --> 00:05:49.512
Listen to me.

00:05:49.592 --> 00:05:51.792
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

00:05:51.872 --> 00:05:53.712
I know what he's got, girl.

00:05:53.912 --> 00:05:56.312
Then you know
we must get it back!

00:05:56.432 --> 00:05:59.752
He's gonna use it
to wipe out Xandar.

00:05:59.912 --> 00:06:02.912
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

00:06:03.192 --> 00:06:05.672
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

00:06:05.752 --> 00:06:06.752
Sentiment?

00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:10.232
Eating away your
brain like maggots!

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:16.392
That's it.

00:06:16.912 --> 00:06:17.912
No!

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:19.592
Sorry, boy.

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:23.312
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

00:06:23.432 --> 00:06:24.632
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.712
If you kill me now,

00:06:29.832 --> 00:06:33.952
you are saying goodbye to the
biggest score you have ever seen.

00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:40.592
The Stone?

00:06:41.392 --> 00:06:43.352
I hope you got
something better than that.

00:06:43.472 --> 00:06:46.192
Because ain't nobody
stealing from Ronan.

00:06:47.352 --> 00:06:48.632
We got a ringer.

00:06:48.752 --> 00:06:50.272
Is that right?

00:06:51.392 --> 00:06:53.672
She knows everything
there is to know about Ronan.

00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:55.192
His ships,

00:06:55.312 --> 00:06:56.792
his army.

00:06:56.912 --> 00:06:58.792
He's vulnerable.

00:06:59.632 --> 00:07:00.872
Hey, what do you
say, Yondu, huh?

00:07:00.952 --> 00:07:04.592
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

00:07:12.352 --> 00:07:13.432
Let him go!

00:07:14.992 --> 00:07:17.632
You always did
have a scrote, boy!

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:20.512
That's why I kept
you on as a young'un.

00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:30.752
Captain, the shot
was non-damaging.

00:07:30.872 --> 00:07:33.232
<i>Attention, idiots.</i>

00:07:35.312 --> 00:07:38.952
<i>The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.</i>

00:07:39.312 --> 00:07:40.832
It's a weapon of my own design.

00:07:40.992 --> 00:07:42.312
What the hell?

00:07:42.672 --> 00:07:45.392
<i>If you don't hand over
our companions now,</i>

00:07:45.552 --> 00:07:47.792
<i>he's gonna tear
your ship a new one.</i>

00:07:47.912 --> 00:07:49.712
<i>A very big new one!</i>

00:07:50.388 --> 00:07:53.268
- I ain't buyin' it.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.

00:07:53.352 --> 00:07:56.472
<i>- 5, 4, 3...</i>
- No! Wait, hold on!

00:07:56.592 --> 00:07:58.392
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:00.512
We figured it out! We're fine!

00:08:00.672 --> 00:08:01.872
<i>Oh, hey, Quill. What's going on?</i>

00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:05.432
You call that "figured it out"?

00:08:05.512 --> 00:08:07.792
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

00:08:07.912 --> 00:08:09.432
Oh, you want to
talk about senseless?

00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:11.792
How about trying to
save us by blowing us up?

00:08:11.872 --> 00:08:14.712
We were only gonna blow you
up if they didn't turn you over!

00:08:14.792 --> 00:08:16.632
And how on earth were
they gonna turn us over

00:08:16.752 --> 00:08:17.872
when you only gave
them a count of five?

00:08:18.512 --> 00:08:20.752
We didn't have time
to work out the minutiae

00:08:20.872 --> 00:08:21.872
of the plan.

00:08:21.952 --> 00:08:24.392
This is what we get
for acting altruistically.

00:08:24.472 --> 00:08:26.552
- I am Groot.
- They are ungrateful.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:27.752
What's important now

00:08:27.872 --> 00:08:29.592
is we get the Ravagers' army

00:08:29.712 --> 00:08:30.872
to help us save Xandar.

00:08:30.952 --> 00:08:32.512
So we can give
the Stone to Yondu

00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:34.072
who's just gonna sell to
somebody even worse?

00:08:34.712 --> 00:08:35.872
We'll figure that
part out later.

00:08:36.032 --> 00:08:37.752
We have to stop Ronan.

00:08:37.872 --> 00:08:39.392
How?

00:08:39.512 --> 00:08:40.552
I have a plan.

00:08:40.632 --> 00:08:41.632
You've got a plan?

00:08:42.072 --> 00:08:43.072
Yes.

00:08:43.712 --> 00:08:44.752
First of all, you're
copying me from

00:08:44.832 --> 00:08:46.352
- when I said I had a plan.
- No, I'm not.

00:08:46.472 --> 00:08:49.392
People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

00:08:49.472 --> 00:08:50.992
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

00:08:51.472 --> 00:08:54.072
I have part of a plan!

00:08:54.392 --> 00:08:55.792
What percentage of
a plan do you have?

00:08:55.912 --> 00:08:57.472
You don't get to ask questions

00:08:57.552 --> 00:08:58.752
after the nonsense
you pulled on Knowhere.

00:08:59.392 --> 00:09:00.832
I just saved Quill.

00:09:00.912 --> 00:09:01.912
We've already established

00:09:01.992 --> 00:09:03.712
that you destroying the ship
that I'm on is not saving me.

00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:05.912
- When did we establish it?
- Like three seconds ago!

00:09:06.072 --> 00:09:07.672
I wasn't listening.
I was thinking of something else.

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:09.872
She's right.
You don't get an opinion.

00:09:10.752 --> 00:09:11.792
What percentage?

00:09:11.912 --> 00:09:13.392
I don't know. Twelve percent.

00:09:13.472 --> 00:09:14.752
Twelve percent?

00:09:16.752 --> 00:09:17.872
That's a fake laugh.

00:09:18.032 --> 00:09:19.792
- It's real!
- Totally fake.

00:09:19.872 --> 00:09:24.552
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

00:09:24.672 --> 00:09:25.712
because that is not a plan.

00:09:25.832 --> 00:09:27.352
It's barely a concept.

00:09:27.472 --> 00:09:28.472
You're taking their side?

00:09:28.592 --> 00:09:29.792
I am Groot.

00:09:29.912 --> 00:09:31.352
So what, it's better than 11%?

00:09:31.432 --> 00:09:32.872
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

00:09:32.952 --> 00:09:35.112
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

00:09:35.712 --> 00:09:39.072
See?
Groot's the only one of you who has a clue.

00:09:44.112 --> 00:09:45.112
Guys.

00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:47.032
Come on.

00:09:47.392 --> 00:09:49.392
Yondu is gonna be
here in two seconds.

00:09:49.472 --> 00:09:51.832
He expects to hear
this big plan of ours.

00:09:53.152 --> 00:09:55.112
I need your help.

00:09:56.832 --> 00:09:59.152
I look around at us.

00:09:59.712 --> 00:10:00.752
You know what I see?

00:10:01.712 --> 00:10:02.712
Losers.

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:06.912
I mean, like,

00:10:07.032 --> 00:10:08.992
folks who have lost stuff.

00:10:09.072 --> 00:10:11.392
And we have.
Man, we have. All of us.

00:10:12.472 --> 00:10:13.752
Our homes,

00:10:14.512 --> 00:10:15.832
our families,

00:10:16.952 --> 00:10:18.872
normal lives.

00:10:18.992 --> 00:10:21.792
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:24.072
Today, it's given us something.

00:10:24.432 --> 00:10:25.832
It has given us a chance.

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:27.472
To do what?

00:10:29.152 --> 00:10:30.632
To give a shit.

00:10:31.432 --> 00:10:33.072
For once.

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:35.432
Not run away.

00:10:38.112 --> 00:10:40.672
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

00:10:40.752 --> 00:10:43.872
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:47.592
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

00:10:48.672 --> 00:10:50.672
it's impossible.

00:10:51.112 --> 00:10:53.512
You're asking us to die.

00:11:00.072 --> 00:11:01.992
Yeah, I guess I am.

00:11:14.872 --> 00:11:15.952
Quill.

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:23.552
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

00:11:27.592 --> 00:11:31.792
I will be grateful to
die among my friends.

00:11:36.032 --> 00:11:37.952
You are an honorable man, Quill.

00:11:39.752 --> 00:11:41.912
I will fight beside you.

00:11:43.072 --> 00:11:44.672
And in the end,

00:11:46.632 --> 00:11:48.672
I will see my wife
and daughter again.

00:11:54.632 --> 00:11:57.752
I am Groot.

00:12:08.032 --> 00:12:11.232
Oh, what the hell.
I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

00:12:17.232 --> 00:12:19.632
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

00:12:19.992 --> 00:12:22.112
We're all standing up now.

00:12:22.272 --> 00:12:25.672
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.272
<i>All right, just so we're clear,</i>

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:28.752
everyone here
knows their role, right?

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.432
- Dave?
- Wheels on the ground.

00:12:30.512 --> 00:12:31.832
- Kurt?
- Eyes in the sky.

00:12:31.912 --> 00:12:33.312
- Luis?
- Oh, man, you know it.

00:12:33.392 --> 00:12:34.872
You know what?
I get to wear a uniform.

00:12:34.952 --> 00:12:36.592
- That's what's up.
- Luis.

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:38.832
I'm sorry. I'm good.
I'm good. I'm just excited.

00:12:38.912 --> 00:12:40.272
Plus, your
girlfriend's really hot.

00:12:40.352 --> 00:12:41.672
So, you know, that
makes me nervous, too.

00:12:41.752 --> 00:12:42.752
And you are very
beautiful, ma'am.

00:12:42.832 --> 00:12:44.672
- Oh, my Lord.
- She's not my...

00:12:44.752 --> 00:12:45.872
You know what? I was thinking of

00:12:45.992 --> 00:12:47.072
a tactic, like when
I go undercover.

00:12:47.152 --> 00:12:49.032
Like a whistling. You know what I'm saying?
To like, blend in.

00:12:49.152 --> 00:12:52.192
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.352
It's not <i>The Andy Griffith Show.</i>
No whistling.

00:13:12.112 --> 00:13:13.392
All clear in Sector One.

00:13:18.552 --> 00:13:19.712
Step out.

00:13:22.272 --> 00:13:23.472
All clear.

00:13:29.232 --> 00:13:30.312
We're set.

00:13:30.872 --> 00:13:32.232
Wish me luck.

00:13:43.592 --> 00:13:45.352
Utilities online.

00:13:57.792 --> 00:13:59.592
Hey! What are you doing?

00:14:00.152 --> 00:14:04.712
Uh... Boss-man said to secure
the area, so I'm securing it.

00:14:06.152 --> 00:14:07.472
I'm the boss.

00:14:07.752 --> 00:14:09.232
- Oh.
- Utilities 1.3...

00:14:23.352 --> 00:14:25.472
<i>Water level is dropping!</i>

00:14:53.992 --> 00:14:55.792
<i>Coming up on extraction pipe.</i>

00:14:55.872 --> 00:14:57.312
All right, I see it.

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:07.072
All right, come on,
I gotta get up there.

00:15:07.192 --> 00:15:08.752
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:15.032
Yes! You got it!
You got it! Come on!

00:15:19.552 --> 00:15:20.592
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

00:15:32.272 --> 00:15:34.312
The Ant-Man is in the building.

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:37.272
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

00:15:39.352 --> 00:15:41.352
Got a Crown Vic
right outside there.

00:15:41.432 --> 00:15:42.672
This is problem?

00:15:42.752 --> 00:15:44.792
Considering the Crown Vic's
the most commonly used car

00:15:44.912 --> 00:15:46.032
for undercover cops, man,

00:15:46.752 --> 00:15:48.192
yes, this is problem.

00:15:52.032 --> 00:15:53.152
That's Pym.

00:15:55.912 --> 00:15:57.272
Oh, no.

00:15:57.352 --> 00:15:58.592
I'm deploying the bullet ants.

00:15:58.712 --> 00:16:00.192
<i>Papanera Claire
de Merna Merna...</i>

00:16:00.272 --> 00:16:03.232
<i>I don't remember what it's
called, but I feel bad for this guy.</i>

00:16:04.552 --> 00:16:05.912
What's up, man? Hey.

00:16:11.472 --> 00:16:12.952
Ow! Ow!

00:16:15.712 --> 00:16:16.832
See?
That's what I'm talking about.

00:16:16.912 --> 00:16:19.312
That's what I call an
unfortunate casualty

00:16:19.392 --> 00:16:21.392
in a very serious operation.

00:16:30.632 --> 00:16:32.752
Signal decoy in place.

00:16:33.312 --> 00:16:35.192
Mean, pretty lady
did good, Scott.

00:16:36.472 --> 00:16:38.752
Looks like Pym's
getting arrested.

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:40.512
Scott, we have problem.

00:16:40.592 --> 00:16:42.472
<i>Problem? What's the problem?</i>

00:16:43.312 --> 00:16:45.832
Dave!
Dave, that's not part of plan!

00:16:45.912 --> 00:16:47.552
Listen to me.

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:51.392
If I don't get into this
building, people will die.

00:16:52.072 --> 00:16:53.752
That's awfully dramatic.

00:16:56.672 --> 00:16:57.952
Are you kidding me?

00:17:02.392 --> 00:17:04.192
Problem solved.

00:17:19.112 --> 00:17:20.312
Well...

00:17:22.072 --> 00:17:23.912
How do I look?

00:17:33.192 --> 00:17:34.192
There he is.

00:17:35.872 --> 00:17:39.032
Just in time. Come on.

00:17:48.352 --> 00:17:50.232
<i>12-point verification.</i>

00:17:50.312 --> 00:17:52.112
Little over-the-top,
don't you think, Darren?

00:17:52.192 --> 00:17:53.672
<i>Confirming authorization level.</i>

00:17:53.752 --> 00:17:55.392
Well, you can never be too safe.

00:17:55.472 --> 00:17:56.512
<i>Access granted.</i>

00:18:04.192 --> 00:18:05.632
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

00:18:06.352 --> 00:18:08.312
You really did it.

00:18:08.392 --> 00:18:10.232
And you only know
the half of it, Hank.

00:18:36.432 --> 00:18:38.072
Arriving in second position.

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:42.032
All right, top speed, Ant-thony.
Let's go!

00:18:53.032 --> 00:18:54.272
Proceeding to command position.

00:19:12.112 --> 00:19:13.712
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

00:19:15.632 --> 00:19:17.712
All right, guys.
I'm in position.

00:19:17.792 --> 00:19:19.472
I'm gonna signal the ants.

00:19:19.552 --> 00:19:21.832
No, no, no, no, no!

00:19:23.152 --> 00:19:24.232
Did you see that?

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:32.312
Assume formation.

00:19:32.392 --> 00:19:34.272
All right, you
cute little crazies,

00:19:34.352 --> 00:19:36.112
let's fry these servers!

00:19:48.352 --> 00:19:50.392
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:03.952
<i>Servers are fried.</i>

00:20:04.032 --> 00:20:06.232
Data backup completely erased.

00:20:06.312 --> 00:20:07.872
Heading to the particle chamber.

00:20:14.432 --> 00:20:16.232
Hello, Dr. Cross.

00:20:20.192 --> 00:20:22.632
My associates have
agreed to your terms.

00:20:22.712 --> 00:20:23.872
Wonderful.

00:20:23.952 --> 00:20:26.792
Mr. Carson introduced me
to these fine gentlemen here.

00:20:26.872 --> 00:20:28.472
They're representatives
of Hydra.

00:20:28.552 --> 00:20:29.872
They're not what they were.

00:20:29.952 --> 00:20:32.232
They're doing some
interesting work.

00:20:32.312 --> 00:20:34.712
And I'm enjoying myself.

00:20:35.512 --> 00:20:37.632
You tried to hide your
technology from me.

00:20:37.712 --> 00:20:39.712
And now it's gonna
blow up in your face.

00:20:43.632 --> 00:20:44.672
Wow.

00:20:45.352 --> 00:20:49.072
Wow! I mean, I saw that
punch coming a mile away,

00:20:49.152 --> 00:20:51.232
but I just figured it'd
be all pathetic and weak.

00:20:51.312 --> 00:20:52.832
Well, you figured wrong.

00:20:54.032 --> 00:20:55.352
I know this van.

00:20:56.752 --> 00:20:57.952
Anybody home?

00:21:03.592 --> 00:21:04.752
All right, guys. I'm here.

00:21:09.392 --> 00:21:11.152
I'm setting the charges.

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:33.072
Great job, guys.
I'll take it from here.

00:21:42.192 --> 00:21:44.792
Good boy, Ant-thony.

00:21:45.752 --> 00:21:46.752
Final position.

00:21:55.392 --> 00:21:57.672
Guys, how we looking
on that laser grid?

00:21:57.752 --> 00:21:59.312
- Almost.
- No, you're not.

00:21:59.392 --> 00:22:00.792
I'm getting close!
No, you're not.

00:22:05.472 --> 00:22:07.152
San Francisco P.D.!

00:22:07.232 --> 00:22:08.232
Out of the van!

00:22:08.832 --> 00:22:09.832
I know you're in there!

00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:10.912
Make it go faster.

00:22:11.032 --> 00:22:12.032
Dude, seriously.

00:22:17.792 --> 00:22:19.872
Ready to jump.
Do you read, Kurt?

00:22:19.952 --> 00:22:20.952
So close.

00:22:21.712 --> 00:22:23.152
Okay, hold up!
Wait a minute! Freeze!

00:22:23.232 --> 00:22:24.872
There was a black guy
that looked exactly like me

00:22:24.952 --> 00:22:26.872
who attacked us and put us in
the back of this disgusting van.

00:22:26.952 --> 00:22:28.432
- Get out of the van!
- Okay, I'm coming.

00:22:28.512 --> 00:22:30.272
Take it easy!

00:22:30.352 --> 00:22:32.352
No, I will not move! Go now!

00:22:34.512 --> 00:22:35.472
Wait!

00:22:35.552 --> 00:22:36.552
What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

00:22:43.512 --> 00:22:44.512
Phew!

00:22:47.072 --> 00:22:48.072
What? What?

00:22:49.792 --> 00:22:51.032
Hey, little guy.

00:23:03.712 --> 00:23:06.832
I always suspected you had a
suit stored away somewhere.

00:23:06.912 --> 00:23:07.912
Which begs the question,

00:23:07.992 --> 00:23:10.112
who is the new Ant-Man?

00:23:10.192 --> 00:23:12.632
Who is the man that
my beloved mentor

00:23:12.712 --> 00:23:14.632
trusted even more than me?

00:23:16.872 --> 00:23:19.112
Scott Lang.

00:23:20.392 --> 00:23:21.952
A martyr

00:23:22.072 --> 00:23:24.472
who took on the system
and paid the price,

00:23:24.552 --> 00:23:28.152
losing his family and his
only daughter in the process.

00:23:28.232 --> 00:23:31.512
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

00:23:32.512 --> 00:23:37.312
He escapes his jail cell without
leaving any clue as to how.

00:23:39.832 --> 00:23:41.472
And then he
disappears magically,

00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:44.792
despite having no
money to his name.

00:23:44.872 --> 00:23:47.552
And now he brings
me the Ant-Man suit.

00:23:49.912 --> 00:23:53.672
The only thing that
can rival my creation.

00:23:53.752 --> 00:23:57.192
Darren, don't do this.

00:23:57.272 --> 00:23:59.312
If you sell to these men,

00:23:59.392 --> 00:24:00.832
it's gonna be chaos.

00:24:00.912 --> 00:24:02.312
I already have.

00:24:02.392 --> 00:24:03.832
And for twice the price,

00:24:03.952 --> 00:24:05.952
thanks to you.

00:24:06.032 --> 00:24:09.352
It's not easy to successfully
infiltrate an Avengers facility.

00:24:09.432 --> 00:24:11.432
Thankfully, word travels fast.

00:24:11.512 --> 00:24:13.352
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,

00:24:13.472 --> 00:24:15.312
but I'm keeping the
particle to myself.

00:24:16.392 --> 00:24:17.792
They don't run on diesel.

00:24:17.872 --> 00:24:20.752
If you want the fuel,
you'll have to come to me.

00:24:21.912 --> 00:24:23.712
What do you call the only man

00:24:23.792 --> 00:24:26.752
who can arm the most
powerful weapon in the world?

00:24:27.392 --> 00:24:30.032
The most powerful
man in the world.

00:24:30.112 --> 00:24:31.632
You proud of me yet?

00:24:31.712 --> 00:24:34.712
You can stop this, Darren.
It's not too late.

00:24:34.792 --> 00:24:38.512
It's been too late
for a long time now.

00:24:39.472 --> 00:24:41.512
Darren!

00:24:42.672 --> 00:24:43.792
What are you doing?

00:24:43.872 --> 00:24:47.072
He wasn't any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me.

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:48.912
This is not who you are.

00:24:48.992 --> 00:24:51.792
It's the particles altering
your brain chemistry.

00:25:00.152 --> 00:25:02.192
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:25:03.912 --> 00:25:06.552
You're right.
I have to be the one to do it.

00:25:09.152 --> 00:25:10.472
Here we go.

00:25:11.832 --> 00:25:15.032
Drop your gun.

00:25:17.672 --> 00:25:20.592
You know, I came to the
house the other night to kill him,

00:25:20.672 --> 00:25:21.752
but you were there.

00:25:21.832 --> 00:25:25.392
You're sick and I can help you.
Just put the gun down.

00:25:25.472 --> 00:25:26.672
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

00:25:28.512 --> 00:25:29.712
but I think I am now!

00:25:29.792 --> 00:25:31.872
Drop your gun now!

00:25:31.992 --> 00:25:35.352
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

00:25:48.632 --> 00:25:49.632
Dad!

00:25:58.312 --> 00:25:59.552
Hank, no.

00:25:59.632 --> 00:26:01.232
No, Hank.

00:26:01.872 --> 00:26:03.792
Hank?
Listen, you're gonna be okay.

00:26:03.872 --> 00:26:05.392
- All right?
- You're gonna be just fine.

00:26:06.992 --> 00:26:09.872
Take the suit off, or I'll blow
your brains out and peel it off.

00:26:35.712 --> 00:26:37.592
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.

00:26:37.672 --> 00:26:39.152
Request immediate backup!

00:26:39.232 --> 00:26:40.512
Go, go, go!

00:26:53.432 --> 00:26:55.312
Get me to the roof.

00:26:55.392 --> 00:26:56.632
And radio ahead.

00:26:56.712 --> 00:26:59.512
I want to make sure the
helicopter is ready to take off.

00:26:59.592 --> 00:27:00.672
You two,

00:27:00.792 --> 00:27:03.432
kill anything that
comes out of that vault!

00:27:03.512 --> 00:27:06.712
Dad, can you move?

00:27:09.072 --> 00:27:10.432
We need to get him out of here.

00:27:11.792 --> 00:27:14.432
Go get that suit.

00:27:57.672 --> 00:27:58.752
Hey, Scotty.

00:27:58.832 --> 00:28:00.592
Hey, did I save your life?

00:28:01.752 --> 00:28:02.832
Scotty?

00:28:02.912 --> 00:28:04.352
Scotty?

00:28:06.752 --> 00:28:08.352
Thank you, Luis.

00:28:08.432 --> 00:28:09.952
Are we the good guys? Yeah.

00:28:10.032 --> 00:28:11.072
We're the good guys, right?

00:28:11.192 --> 00:28:12.192
Yeah, we're the good guys.

00:28:12.832 --> 00:28:14.592
Feels kinda weird, you know.

00:28:14.672 --> 00:28:16.752
Yeah, but we're not done yet.

00:28:16.832 --> 00:28:18.912
Get out of here
before this place blows!

00:28:25.632 --> 00:28:28.872
Damn it! That guy.

00:28:30.032 --> 00:28:32.192
Hey! We're getting out of here!

00:28:36.712 --> 00:28:37.752
The charges are set.

00:28:37.832 --> 00:28:39.792
We've gotta find a way out of here.
And fast.

00:28:39.872 --> 00:28:41.792
Don't worry.

00:28:41.872 --> 00:28:44.472
I'm not gonna die.

00:28:44.552 --> 00:28:45.992
And neither are you.

00:28:47.032 --> 00:28:49.552
It's not a keychain.

00:28:52.672 --> 00:28:55.592
It's total chaos in here!
Multiple shots fired!

00:29:06.392 --> 00:29:08.192
And there's a tank.

00:29:17.752 --> 00:29:19.312
A little help!

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:21.912
I got it.

00:29:22.752 --> 00:29:24.192
We need a doctor!

00:29:25.472 --> 00:29:26.752
We've got him.

00:29:28.872 --> 00:29:30.512
Thank you.

00:29:31.832 --> 00:29:33.432
Let's go!

00:29:49.472 --> 00:29:50.832
Ant-thony!

00:30:04.192 --> 00:30:05.472
Go!

00:30:06.752 --> 00:30:07.912
You're gonna regret that.

00:30:18.272 --> 00:30:19.872
Wait a minute!
Get out of that van!

00:30:19.952 --> 00:30:21.552
What? Get out of that van!

00:30:21.632 --> 00:30:23.472
It's too loud, there's a tank.
I can't hear you!

00:30:24.632 --> 00:30:27.112
Hey! Hey!

00:30:31.912 --> 00:30:34.192
Are you crazy? Put the gun down!

00:30:34.272 --> 00:30:35.792
The windows!

00:30:40.272 --> 00:30:43.072
Did you think you could
stop the future with a heist?

00:30:43.152 --> 00:30:44.712
It was never just a heist!

00:31:06.952 --> 00:31:08.392
Put the gun down!

00:31:17.032 --> 00:31:19.152
Okay, I got him, I got him.
There he is! Go, go, go!

00:31:35.392 --> 00:31:37.432
We gotta set her down somewhere.

00:32:07.432 --> 00:32:09.832
I'm gonna disintegrate you!

00:32:09.912 --> 00:32:11.312

00:32:50.112 --> 00:32:51.152
Call 911!

00:33:09.472 --> 00:33:11.272
It's okay.

00:33:15.712 --> 00:33:17.632
Freeze! Put your hands up!
Get them up!

00:33:20.232 --> 00:33:21.232
Scott?

00:33:21.312 --> 00:33:22.632
Paxton, you have
to listen to me!

00:33:50.952 --> 00:33:53.192
Paxton, turn around!
Take me back!

00:33:53.272 --> 00:33:55.272
I am taking you back. To prison.

00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:57.792
There's something in that
backyard that needs to be destroyed.

00:33:57.872 --> 00:33:58.992
In the bug zapper. There...

00:34:00.792 --> 00:34:04.112
You need to desist right now!
Your delusions are out of hand.

Cassie! That's my house.

00:34:27.552 --> 00:34:28.832
Don't be scared.

00:34:29.832 --> 00:34:31.112
Paxton, let me help!

00:34:31.192 --> 00:34:32.152
Don't move.

00:34:32.232 --> 00:34:33.232
Let me help!

00:34:33.312 --> 00:34:34.312
Maggie! What's going on?

00:34:34.392 --> 00:34:35.352
He's got Cassie!

00:34:35.432 --> 00:34:36.992
Who's got Cassie, honey?
That thing.

00:34:37.072 --> 00:34:38.312
Thing? I don't know!
I don't know!

00:34:47.312 --> 00:34:48.952
Are you a monster?

00:34:50.432 --> 00:34:52.552
Do I look like a monster?

00:34:53.592 --> 00:34:55.032
I want my daddy!

00:34:56.712 --> 00:34:58.072
I want your daddy, too.

00:35:01.872 --> 00:35:02.912
There you are.

00:35:02.992 --> 00:35:04.312
Daddy, is that you?

00:35:05.992 --> 00:35:06.992
Hi, peanut.

00:35:07.832 --> 00:35:10.112
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

00:35:23.432 --> 00:35:26.152
Now, where did
you go, little guy?

00:35:31.232 --> 00:35:32.312
There you are.

00:35:36.272 --> 00:35:37.632
Not just me!

00:35:48.392 --> 00:35:49.632
Damn it!

00:35:50.312 --> 00:35:51.952
Go! Go!

00:36:45.632 --> 00:36:47.272
Scotty needs us, you
know what I'm saying?

Ain't nothing gonna stop us.

00:36:51.952 --> 00:36:53.072
Back it up.

00:36:53.152 --> 00:36:54.112
Back it up, slow.

00:36:54.192 --> 00:36:55.192
Yeah.

00:36:55.272 --> 00:36:56.632
Back it up. Yeah.

00:36:56.712 --> 00:36:58.152
Back it up. Okay.

00:36:59.392 --> 00:37:00.992
- We just back it up, okay?
- That's it.

00:37:01.072 --> 00:37:02.472
Back it up. That's right.

00:37:02.552 --> 00:37:03.872
Backin' up?

00:37:03.992 --> 00:37:05.312
Yep, just backin' up.

00:37:05.392 --> 00:37:06.632
No, no. Just back it up.

00:37:13.352 --> 00:37:15.392
You insult me, Scott.

00:37:19.672 --> 00:37:23.432
Your very existence
is insulting to me.

00:37:25.072 --> 00:37:28.672
You know, it'd be much easier
to hit you if you were bigger.

00:37:30.912 --> 00:37:32.192
Yeah, I agree.

00:37:53.792 --> 00:37:54.792
Cassie!

00:38:01.952 --> 00:38:05.592
I'm gonna show you just
how insignificant you are.

00:38:06.752 --> 00:38:09.152
Cassie! I'm coming!

00:38:21.952 --> 00:38:23.632
That's a messed-up looking dog.

00:38:23.712 --> 00:38:24.832
I'm gonna destroy

00:38:24.912 --> 00:38:26.472
everything you love.

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:29.632
Freeze! S.F.P.D.

00:38:37.472 --> 00:38:38.792
I can't break through.

00:38:39.752 --> 00:38:41.792
It's titanium, you idiot!

00:38:47.952 --> 00:38:49.872
Get her out of here. Come on.

00:38:51.072 --> 00:38:52.392
Sorry, sweetheart.

00:38:52.472 --> 00:38:54.912
You have to help Daddy
pay for his mistakes.

00:38:54.992 --> 00:38:56.352
You stay behind me, okay? Okay.

00:38:56.432 --> 00:38:57.432
Stay behind me.

00:38:58.832 --> 00:39:01.832
I'm gonna have to shrink between
the molecules to get in there.

00:39:01.912 --> 00:39:03.952
Get away from us!

00:39:05.832 --> 00:39:06.832
Daddy, help!

00:39:06.912 --> 00:39:08.512
I love you, Cassie.

00:39:38.272 --> 00:39:39.712
Daddy, where are you?

<i>You could go subatomic.</i>

00:39:43.392 --> 00:39:44.552
<i>You could go subatomic.</i>

00:39:45.632 --> 00:39:46.872
Oh, no.

<i>Do not screw with the regulator!</i>

I love you so much.

00:42:02.792 --> 00:42:03.952
I love you, too.

00:42:04.632 --> 00:42:05.712
So much.

00:42:10.112 --> 00:42:11.512
You know, there's
a big hole in the roof.

00:42:14.912 --> 00:42:16.112
Sorry.

00:42:18.872 --> 00:42:20.872
Is she all right?
Yeah, she's fine.

00:42:22.912 --> 00:42:23.912
Mommy!

00:42:26.832 --> 00:42:28.432

00:42:40.032 --> 00:42:41.912
You don't remember anything?

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:43.152
Hank. I don't.

00:42:43.232 --> 00:42:45.632
There must be something else.

00:42:47.352 --> 00:42:50.472
Well, I suppose the human mind

00:42:50.552 --> 00:42:53.232
just can't comprehend
the experience,

00:42:55.312 --> 00:42:56.632
but you made it.

00:42:57.312 --> 00:42:58.912
You went in,

00:43:00.312 --> 00:43:02.032
and you got out.

00:43:04.232 --> 00:43:05.832
It's amazing.

00:43:06.512 --> 00:43:08.272
Scott,

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:10.232
I'll walk you out.

00:43:14.232 --> 00:43:15.752
Get some rest.

00:43:23.992 --> 00:43:26.392
Is it possible?

00:43:44.272 --> 00:43:45.312
When did this happen?

00:43:45.392 --> 00:43:46.512
Nothing's happening.

00:43:46.592 --> 00:43:48.832
Whoa. Hold on.
Something's kind of happening.

00:43:48.912 --> 00:43:50.952
Well, if that's the case,

00:43:51.032 --> 00:43:52.512
shoot me again.

00:43:52.912 --> 00:43:54.112
Yeah.
I don't know what you were doing,

00:43:54.272 --> 00:43:55.512
grabbing and
kissing me like that.

00:43:55.592 --> 00:43:57.512
I'm a little surprised myself.

00:43:57.592 --> 00:43:59.952
I have to get somewhere.
I'll see you later, Hank.

00:44:00.032 --> 00:44:01.472
Really, Hope.

00:44:02.312 --> 00:44:03.712
Scott. Yeah?

00:44:04.312 --> 00:44:06.032
You're full of shit. Oh, yeah.

00:44:07.472 --> 00:44:09.392
Scott, I met with
my captain today.

00:44:09.472 --> 00:44:12.152
He wanted a report on the
night that you got out of jail.

00:44:12.792 --> 00:44:14.112
Something happened
with the cameras.

00:44:14.992 --> 00:44:17.152
Some circuits got fried.

00:44:18.272 --> 00:44:20.512
But I told him that you
were processed correctly.

00:44:20.592 --> 00:44:21.712
Really?

00:44:21.832 --> 00:44:23.192
Well, yeah.

00:44:24.992 --> 00:44:27.912
Can't be sending Cassie's dad
back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

00:44:27.992 --> 00:44:29.992
Thank you, Paxton.

00:44:30.072 --> 00:44:31.472
I'm blown away.

00:44:32.312 --> 00:44:34.072
Thank you for everything
you do for Cassie.

00:44:34.152 --> 00:44:36.192
Well, that's my pleasure.

00:44:37.472 --> 00:44:40.592
But, no.
This one, I did for you.

00:44:42.632 --> 00:44:44.032
This is awkward. Yeah.

00:44:44.112 --> 00:44:45.912
Yeah.

00:44:45.992 --> 00:44:47.432
I mean, what do we even
talk about after all of that?

00:44:47.512 --> 00:44:48.912
Oh, I know. What?

00:44:48.992 --> 00:44:50.232
I did my first cartwheel today.

00:44:50.352 --> 00:44:51.552
What?

00:44:51.632 --> 00:44:54.232
Yeah.
She has been practicing all week.

00:44:54.312 --> 00:44:55.712
But today was the magic day.

00:44:55.792 --> 00:44:56.792
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

00:44:58.512 --> 00:45:00.872
- No, that can't be Cassie.
- That's not you.

00:45:00.952 --> 00:45:02.512
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah, it is.

00:45:02.592 --> 00:45:04.752
This is a professional gymnast.
There is no way that's you.

00:45:04.832 --> 00:45:05.952
Yeah, that's her.

00:45:06.872 --> 00:45:08.472
Good boy.

00:45:10.352 --> 00:45:13.112
Sweetie, that's pretty
amazing, peanut.

00:45:16.032 --> 00:45:17.032
Sorry.

00:45:18.712 --> 00:45:20.472
It's work.

00:45:21.112 --> 00:45:22.392
Yeah.

00:45:24.072 --> 00:45:25.072
All right.

00:45:25.152 --> 00:45:26.912
Here's the deal.
Just give me the facts.

00:45:26.992 --> 00:45:28.312
Just the facts. Only the facts.

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:32.272
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

00:45:32.352 --> 00:45:33.952
No, no, no.
No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

00:45:34.072 --> 00:45:36.472
So, I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

00:45:36.552 --> 00:45:38.752
<i>And there was this, like,
abstract expressionism exhibit.</i>

00:45:38.832 --> 00:45:41.072
<i>But you know me, I'm more like
a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?</i>

00:45:41.152 --> 00:45:43.832
<i>But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!</i>

00:45:43.912 --> 00:45:44.952
Luis.

00:45:45.072 --> 00:45:46.072
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

00:45:46.152 --> 00:45:48.152
You know, I just
get excited and stuff.

00:45:48.232 --> 00:45:50.152
<i>But anyway, Ignacio tells me,</i>

00:45:50.232 --> 00:45:52.032
<i>"Yo, I met this
crazy-fine writer chick</i>

00:45:52.152 --> 00:45:53.872
<i>"at the Spot last night.
Like fine-fine.</i>

00:45:53.952 --> 00:45:55.072
<i>"Like crazy-stupid fine." And he</i>

00:45:55.232 --> 00:45:56.312
<i>"goes up to the
bartender and goes,</i>

00:45:56.392 --> 00:45:58.112
<i>"Look at the girl I'm with.
You know what I'm sayin'?</i>

00:45:58.192 --> 00:45:59.472
<i>"She's crazy-stupid
fine, right?"</i>

00:45:59.552 --> 00:46:02.152
<i>The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."</i>

00:46:02.232 --> 00:46:04.152
<i>So this writer
chick tells Ignacio,</i>

00:46:04.272 --> 00:46:07.032
<i>"Yo, I'm like a boss in the
world of guerrilla journalism,</i>

00:46:07.112 --> 00:46:08.832
<i>"and I got mad connects with
the peeps behind the curtains,</i>

00:46:08.912 --> 00:46:09.912
<i>"you know what I'm saying?"</i>

00:46:09.992 --> 00:46:11.512
<i>Ignacio's like, "For real?"</i>

00:46:11.592 --> 00:46:12.952
<i>And she's like,
"Yeah, you know what,</i>

00:46:13.072 --> 00:46:14.512
<i>I can't tell you
who my contact is,</i>

00:46:14.592 --> 00:46:16.032
<i>"because he works
with the Avengers."</i>

00:46:16.112 --> 00:46:17.352
Oh, no.

00:46:17.432 --> 00:46:19.872
Yeah, and this dude
sounds like a badass, man.

00:46:19.952 --> 00:46:21.112
Like, he comes
up to her and says,

00:46:21.192 --> 00:46:23.192
<i>"Yo, I'm looking for this
dude who's new on the scene,</i>

00:46:23.272 --> 00:46:24.432
<i>"who's flashing his fresh tack,</i>

00:46:24.512 --> 00:46:27.032
<i>"who's got, like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"</i>

00:46:27.112 --> 00:46:28.672
<i>And she's like, "Well,
we got everything</i>

00:46:28.792 --> 00:46:30.272
<i>nowadays.
We got a guy who jumps.</i>

00:46:30.352 --> 00:46:32.432
<i>"We got a guy who swings, we
got a guy who crawls up the walls.</i>

00:46:32.512 --> 00:46:34.192
<i>"You gotta be more specific."</i>

00:46:34.272 --> 00:46:36.152
<i>And he's like, "I'm looking
for a guy that shrinks."</i>

00:46:36.232 --> 00:46:37.872
And I'm, like, "Damn!"
I got all nervous

00:46:37.992 --> 00:46:39.672
'cause I'd keep mad
secrets for you, bro.

00:46:39.752 --> 00:46:40.792
So I asked Ignacio,

00:46:40.872 --> 00:46:42.872
<i>"Did the badass tell the
stupid-fine writer chick</i>

00:46:42.952 --> 00:46:45.192
"to tell you to tell me,
because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

00:46:45.312 --> 00:46:46.512
"that he's looking for him?"

00:46:47.152 --> 00:46:49.752
And? What'd he say?

00:46:52.992 --> 00:46:54.472
He said, "Yes."

00:47:06.365 --> 00:47:09.325
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?

00:47:09.405 --> 00:47:10.405
We will.

00:47:10.485 --> 00:47:12.165
GSG 9's got the borders covered.

00:47:12.245 --> 00:47:14.045
Recon's flying 24/7.

00:47:14.205 --> 00:47:15.645
They'll get a hit.
We'll handle it.

00:47:15.805 --> 00:47:17.565
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.

00:47:17.765 --> 00:47:20.125
It's clear you
can't be objective.

00:47:20.285 --> 00:47:21.805
I'm putting Special Ops on this.

00:47:21.965 --> 00:47:23.125
What happens when
the shooting starts?

00:47:23.205 --> 00:47:24.525
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?

00:47:24.605 --> 00:47:25.925
If we're provoked.

00:47:26.085 --> 00:47:27.725
Barnes would've been eliminated

00:47:27.805 --> 00:47:29.405
in Romania if it
wasn't for Rogers.

00:47:29.565 --> 00:47:33.365
There are dead people
who would be alive now.

00:47:34.365 --> 00:47:36.245
Feel free to check my math.

00:47:36.405 --> 00:47:37.805
All due respect, you're
not gonna solve this

00:47:37.885 --> 00:47:39.165
with boys and bullets, Ross.

00:47:39.245 --> 00:47:40.445
You gotta let us bring them in.

00:47:40.605 --> 00:47:42.525
How would that end any
differently than last time?

00:47:42.685 --> 00:47:43.725
Because this time,

00:47:43.805 --> 00:47:45.565
I won't be wearing
loafers and a silk shirt.

00:47:46.685 --> 00:47:48.645
72 hours, guaranteed.

00:47:48.845 --> 00:47:50.645
36 hours.

00:47:52.205 --> 00:47:53.485
Barnes.

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.325
Rogers.

00:47:57.045 --> 00:47:58.045
Wilson.

00:47:58.125 --> 00:47:59.325
Thank you, sir.

00:48:03.605 --> 00:48:05.525
My left arm is numb.
Is that normal?

00:48:08.925 --> 00:48:10.005
You all right?

00:48:10.165 --> 00:48:11.245
Always.

00:48:15.365 --> 00:48:17.605
36 hours. Jeez.

00:48:17.765 --> 00:48:19.805
We're seriously understaffed.

00:48:19.965 --> 00:48:21.165
Oh, yeah.

00:48:21.325 --> 00:48:24.365
It'd be great if we had a Hulk
right about now. Any shot?

00:48:26.245 --> 00:48:28.845
You really think
he'd be on our side?

00:48:29.045 --> 00:48:30.085
No.

00:48:30.165 --> 00:48:31.445
I have an idea.

00:48:31.605 --> 00:48:34.045
Me, too. Where's yours?

00:48:34.205 --> 00:48:36.005
Downstairs.

00:48:36.165 --> 00:48:37.325
Where's yours?

00:48:59.325 --> 00:49:00.685
Hey, May.

00:49:00.845 --> 00:49:02.005
Mmm. Hey.

00:49:04.165 --> 00:49:05.885
How was school today?

00:49:06.085 --> 00:49:07.325
It was okay.

00:49:07.485 --> 00:49:09.765
This crazy car parked outside.

00:49:13.285 --> 00:49:15.005
Oh, Mr. Parker. Um...

00:49:17.245 --> 00:49:19.285
What are you doing...

00:49:19.445 --> 00:49:21.245
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.

00:49:21.405 --> 00:49:22.685
Tony.

00:49:23.085 --> 00:49:24.725
What are you doing here?

00:49:24.885 --> 00:49:26.165
It's about time we met.

00:49:26.245 --> 00:49:27.965
You've been getting
my emails, right?

00:49:28.165 --> 00:49:29.765
Yeah. Yeah. Right?

00:49:29.965 --> 00:49:30.965
Regarding the...

00:49:31.045 --> 00:49:32.045
You didn't even tell
me about the grant.

00:49:32.205 --> 00:49:33.685
About the grant.
The September Foundation.

00:49:33.845 --> 00:49:34.845
Right. Yeah.

00:49:34.925 --> 00:49:35.925
Remember when you applied?

00:49:36.045 --> 00:49:37.045
Yeah.

00:49:37.165 --> 00:49:39.685
I approved, so now
we're in business.

00:49:40.405 --> 00:49:42.365
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

00:49:42.525 --> 00:49:43.605
You keeping secrets from me now?

00:49:43.765 --> 00:49:45.645
I just know how much
you love surprises

00:49:45.725 --> 00:49:47.565
so I thought I
would let you know...

00:49:48.725 --> 00:49:49.725
Anyway, what did I apply for?

00:49:49.805 --> 00:49:50.805
That's what I'm
here to hash out.

00:49:51.005 --> 00:49:52.365
Okay. Hash it out, okay.

00:49:52.525 --> 00:49:55.165
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.

00:49:55.325 --> 00:49:57.645
Yeah, well, we come in all
shapes and sizes, you know?

00:49:58.045 --> 00:50:00.205
This walnut date
loaf is exceptional.

00:50:00.365 --> 00:50:01.765
Let me just stop you there.
Yeah.

00:50:01.925 --> 00:50:05.725
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?

00:50:05.885 --> 00:50:07.125
Yeah, it's pretty well funded.

00:50:07.205 --> 00:50:08.365
Yeah? Wow.

00:50:08.445 --> 00:50:10.085
Look who you're talking to.

00:50:10.245 --> 00:50:11.245
Can I have five
minutes with him?

00:50:11.325 --> 00:50:12.365
Sure.

00:50:18.205 --> 00:50:21.525
As walnut date loaves
go, that wasn't bad.

00:50:22.805 --> 00:50:25.605
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?

00:50:25.765 --> 00:50:27.485
Thrift store? Salvation Army?

00:50:27.645 --> 00:50:29.565
Uh, the garbage, actually.
You're a dumpster diver?

00:50:29.725 --> 00:50:30.845
Yeah, I was...

00:50:31.045 --> 00:50:32.485
Anyway, look, um,

00:50:32.565 --> 00:50:34.125
I definitely did not
apply for your grant...

00:50:34.205 --> 00:50:35.925
Ah-ah! Me first. Okay.

00:50:36.005 --> 00:50:38.485
Quick question of
the rhetorical variety.

00:50:39.845 --> 00:50:41.805
That's you, right?

00:50:42.165 --> 00:50:43.165
Um, no.

00:50:43.245 --> 00:50:44.885
What do you mean? Yeah.

00:50:45.805 --> 00:50:47.405
Look at you go.

00:50:47.565 --> 00:50:50.725
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

00:50:50.885 --> 00:50:53.645
That's not easy.
You got mad skills.

00:50:53.805 --> 00:50:55.725
That's all on
YouTube, though, right?

00:50:55.805 --> 00:50:57.325
That's where you found that?

00:50:57.485 --> 00:50:58.525
Because you
know that's all fake.

00:50:58.605 --> 00:50:59.645
It's all done on the computer.

00:50:59.845 --> 00:51:00.885
Mmm-hmm.

00:51:00.965 --> 00:51:03.045
It's like that video.
What is it?

00:51:03.245 --> 00:51:05.005
Yeah.
Oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?

00:51:05.205 --> 00:51:06.325
Exactly.

00:51:06.405 --> 00:51:07.725
Oh, what have we here?

00:51:09.205 --> 00:51:10.885
Uh...

00:51:16.965 --> 00:51:18.765
You're the Spider-ling.

00:51:18.965 --> 00:51:20.845
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

00:51:23.645 --> 00:51:25.245
Spider-Man.

00:51:25.645 --> 00:51:27.445
Not in that onesie, you're not.

00:51:28.005 --> 00:51:29.925
It's not a onesie.

00:51:31.325 --> 00:51:32.645
I don't believe this.
I was actually having

00:51:32.725 --> 00:51:34.525
a really good day
today, Mr. Stark.

00:51:34.685 --> 00:51:36.045
Didn't miss my train,
this perfectly good

00:51:36.125 --> 00:51:37.845
DVD player was
just sitting there...

00:51:38.485 --> 00:51:41.085
and Algebra test, nailed it.

00:51:41.805 --> 00:51:43.445
Who else knows? Anybody?

00:51:44.925 --> 00:51:46.045
Nobody.

00:51:46.445 --> 00:51:48.445
Not even your
unusually attractive aunt?

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:49.885
No. No.

00:51:50.045 --> 00:51:52.645
No!
If she knew, she would freak out.

00:51:52.805 --> 00:51:54.525
And when she
freaks out, I freak out.

00:51:54.685 --> 00:51:56.805
You know what I think is really cool?
This webbing.

00:51:58.045 --> 00:52:00.485
That tensile strength
is off the charts.

00:52:00.565 --> 00:52:01.965
Who manufactured that?

00:52:02.245 --> 00:52:03.445
I did.

00:52:04.525 --> 00:52:06.125
Climbing walls,
how you doing that?

00:52:06.285 --> 00:52:07.525
Adhesive gloves?

00:52:07.725 --> 00:52:09.005
It's a long story. I was...

00:52:09.645 --> 00:52:11.845
Lordy!
Can you even see in these?

00:52:12.005 --> 00:52:13.005
Yes, I can.

00:52:13.165 --> 00:52:14.325
I'm blind!

00:52:15.285 --> 00:52:16.885
I can see in those.

00:52:16.965 --> 00:52:17.965
Okay?

00:52:18.045 --> 00:52:20.405
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...

00:52:20.485 --> 00:52:22.765
it's like my senses
have been dialed to 11.

00:52:23.325 --> 00:52:25.525
There's way too much input,

00:52:25.605 --> 00:52:27.605
so they just kinda
help me focus.

00:52:27.765 --> 00:52:30.125
You're in dire
need of an upgrade.

00:52:30.285 --> 00:52:32.685
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

00:52:32.765 --> 00:52:33.765
That's why I'm here.

00:52:36.725 --> 00:52:37.885
Why you doing this?

00:52:39.245 --> 00:52:40.485
I gotta know, what's your MO?

00:52:40.565 --> 00:52:41.925
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?

00:52:43.125 --> 00:52:44.325
Because...

00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:50.325
Because I've been
me my whole life,

00:52:50.405 --> 00:52:52.085
and I've had these
powers for six months.

00:52:52.525 --> 00:52:53.725
Mmm-hmm.

00:52:53.805 --> 00:52:56.165
I read books, I build computers.

00:52:57.405 --> 00:53:00.045
Yeah, I would
love to play football,

00:53:00.125 --> 00:53:01.685
but I couldn't then,
so I shouldn't now.

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.445
Sure, because you're different.

00:53:03.605 --> 00:53:06.045
Exactly.
But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not.

00:53:10.245 --> 00:53:14.525
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

00:53:16.765 --> 00:53:18.845
and then the bad
things happen...

00:53:19.805 --> 00:53:21.485
they happen because of you.

00:53:26.125 --> 00:53:27.405
So you wanna look
out for the little guy,

00:53:27.485 --> 00:53:28.685
you wanna do your part?

00:53:28.885 --> 00:53:31.085
Make the world a better
place, all that, right?

00:53:31.245 --> 00:53:33.805
Yeah, just looking
out for the little guy.

00:53:34.885 --> 00:53:36.445
That's what it is.

00:53:43.725 --> 00:53:45.885
I'm gonna sit here,
so you move the leg.

00:53:54.805 --> 00:53:56.045
You got a passport?

00:53:56.125 --> 00:53:57.485
No, I don't even
have a driver's license.

00:53:57.645 --> 00:53:59.045
You ever been to Germany? No.

00:53:59.205 --> 00:54:00.245
Oh, you'll love it.

00:54:00.405 --> 00:54:02.325
I can't go to Germany. Why?

00:54:04.765 --> 00:54:06.045
I got homework.

00:54:06.645 --> 00:54:08.565
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

00:54:08.765 --> 00:54:10.765
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

00:54:10.925 --> 00:54:12.005
Might be a little dangerous.

00:54:12.085 --> 00:54:13.965
Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm
taking you on a field trip.

00:54:16.805 --> 00:54:18.645
Don't tell Aunt May.

00:54:19.405 --> 00:54:20.605
All right, Spider-Man.

00:54:24.165 --> 00:54:25.405
Get me out of this.

00:54:25.565 --> 00:54:26.685
Sorry. I'll get the...

00:55:10.818 --> 00:55:13.098
There's something
I want to show you.

00:55:15.298 --> 00:55:18.538
I realized you
can't destroy power.

00:55:20.258 --> 00:55:24.178
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

00:55:30.858 --> 00:55:33.058
This is an advanced prototype

00:55:33.138 --> 00:55:36.018
that your mother and
I worked on together.

00:55:37.378 --> 00:55:40.058
She never got to use it.

00:55:40.698 --> 00:55:45.098
But now I realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

00:55:51.738 --> 00:55:54.258
Maybe it's time we finished it.

00:56:00.898 --> 00:56:03.378
It's about damn time.
