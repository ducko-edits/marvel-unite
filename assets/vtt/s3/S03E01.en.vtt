00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.620
Peter.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.060
Your momma wants
to speak with you.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.300
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.340
Why have you been fighting
with the other boys again, baby?

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.180
Peter?

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.940
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.060
Smushed it with a stick.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.820
You're so like your daddy.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.340
You even look like him.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.820
And he was an angel.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.900
- Composed out of pure light.
- Mer?

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.980
You got a present there
for Peter, don't you?

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.380
Of course.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.820
There.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.220
I've got you covered, Pete.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.620
You open it up
when I'm gone, okay?

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.700
Your grandpa...

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.140
...is gonna take such
good care of you.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.100
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.980
Take my hand.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.180
Peter.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.860
Pete, come on.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.940
Take my hand.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.020
Mom?

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.300
No! No! No! No!

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.860
Mom! No!

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.420
- Come with me.
- No!

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.300
No!

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.260
You've got to stay here. Please.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.860
No...

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.740
Okay?

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.220
No.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.460
Mom!

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.640
Drop it!

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.080
Uh, hey.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.880
- Drop it, now!
- Hey, cool, man. No problem.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.960
No problem at all.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.280
How do you know about this?

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.960
I don't even know what that is.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.640
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.120
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.640
This is just an outfit, man.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.080
Ninja Turtle, you
better stop poking me.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200
What is your name?

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.280
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.080
- Move!
- Why?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.120
Ronan may have
questions for you.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.720
Hey, you know what?

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.960
There's another name
you might know me by.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.640
Star-Lord.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.920
Who?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.200
Star-Lord, man.
Legendary outlaw.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.800
- Guys?
- Move!

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.880
Ah, forget this.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.160
Peter?

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.120
What happened?

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.680
Hey, uh...

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.800
Uh... I...

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.440
- Bereet.
- Bereet!

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.080
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest with you.
I forgot you're here.

00:11:42.583 --> 00:11:44.383
<i>All right, what do you see?</i>

00:11:44.543 --> 00:11:46.543
Standard beat cops.

00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:49.263
Small station.

00:11:51.423 --> 00:11:52.543
Quiet street.

00:11:53.023 --> 00:11:54.503
<i>It's a good target.</i>

00:11:54.663 --> 00:11:56.823
There's an ATM on the
south corner, which means?

00:11:56.983 --> 00:11:58.023
Cameras.

00:11:58.183 --> 00:11:59.863
<i>Both cross streets are one-way.</i>

00:12:00.023 --> 00:12:01.623
So, compromised escape routes.

00:12:02.383 --> 00:12:04.183
Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.

00:12:04.263 --> 00:12:06.303
He isn't afraid to make
a mess on the way out.

00:12:06.423 --> 00:12:08.343
You see that Range
Rover halfway up the block?

00:12:08.543 --> 00:12:10.463
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.

00:12:10.543 --> 00:12:11.703
<i>It's also bulletproof,</i>

00:12:11.783 --> 00:12:13.023
<i>which means private security...</i>

00:12:13.103 --> 00:12:14.503
<i>which means more guns...</i>

00:12:14.663 --> 00:12:17.143
<i>which means more headaches for somebody.
Probably us.</i>

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:19.783
You guys know I can move
things with my mind, right?

00:12:19.943 --> 00:12:22.463
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.

00:12:22.983 --> 00:12:25.463
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?

00:12:25.543 --> 00:12:27.863
<i>Not to my face. Why?
Did you hear something?</i>

00:12:27.983 --> 00:12:29.223
<i>Eyes on target, folks.</i>

00:12:29.423 --> 00:12:30.983
This is the best lead
we've had on Rumlow

00:12:31.063 --> 00:12:32.343
in six months.
I don't want to lose him.

00:12:32.423 --> 00:12:34.743
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.

00:12:34.863 --> 00:12:36.263
He kind of hates us.

00:12:39.863 --> 00:12:40.983
Sam...

00:12:41.143 --> 00:12:42.583
see that garbage truck?

00:12:42.743 --> 00:12:43.743
Tag it.

00:13:02.503 --> 00:13:03.583
Give me X-ray.

00:13:08.703 --> 00:13:10.423
That truck's loaded
for max weight.

00:13:10.583 --> 00:13:11.583
And the driver's armed.

00:13:11.743 --> 00:13:12.823
It's a battering ram.

00:13:12.903 --> 00:13:13.903
<i>Go now.</i> What?

00:13:15.143 --> 00:13:16.343
He's not hitting the police.

00:14:20.543 --> 00:14:22.503
Body armor, AR-15s.

00:14:22.663 --> 00:14:24.223
<i>I make seven hostiles.</i>

00:14:33.023 --> 00:14:34.423
I make five.

00:14:39.103 --> 00:14:40.983
Sam.

00:14:44.423 --> 00:14:45.543
Four.

00:14:49.943 --> 00:14:51.343
Rumlow's on the third floor.

00:14:51.543 --> 00:14:52.903
Wanda, just like we practiced.

00:14:53.063 --> 00:14:54.063
What about the gas?

00:14:54.183 --> 00:14:55.223
Get it out.

00:15:13.223 --> 00:15:14.263
Pack it up.

00:15:51.703 --> 00:15:52.863
He's here.

00:15:56.663 --> 00:15:58.103
Rumlow has a biological weapon.

00:15:58.263 --> 00:15:59.543
<i>I'm on it.</i>

00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:36.583
I don't work like that no more.

00:16:39.743 --> 00:16:40.743
Fire in the hole.

00:16:46.463 --> 00:16:47.503
No!

00:17:10.343 --> 00:17:11.383
Sam.

00:17:11.543 --> 00:17:13.663
<i>He's in an AFV heading north.</i>

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:20.383
Take this to the airstrip.

00:17:20.463 --> 00:17:22.583
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.

00:17:29.943 --> 00:17:31.023
Where are you going to meet us?

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:32.663
I'm not.

00:17:43.943 --> 00:17:45.743
I've got four,
they're splitting up.

00:17:50.623 --> 00:17:52.263
I got the two on the left.

00:18:00.703 --> 00:18:01.943
They ditched their gear.

00:18:02.103 --> 00:18:03.863
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.

00:18:09.903 --> 00:18:11.863
There you are,
you son of a bitch.

00:18:12.903 --> 00:18:14.183
I've been waiting for this.

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:32.743
He doesn't have it.

00:18:33.343 --> 00:18:34.343
I'm empty!

00:18:34.423 --> 00:18:35.743
Out of the way!

00:19:15.063 --> 00:19:16.343
Drop it.

00:19:16.663 --> 00:19:17.663
Or I'll drop this.

00:19:19.463 --> 00:19:21.303
Drop it! He'll do it!

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:30.463
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.

00:19:30.623 --> 00:19:31.623
Don't thank me.

00:19:31.823 --> 00:19:33.423
I'm not thanking that thing.

00:19:33.583 --> 00:19:34.583
His name is Redwing.

00:19:34.783 --> 00:19:35.783
<i>I'm still not thanking it.</i>

00:19:35.903 --> 00:19:37.183
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.

00:19:43.983 --> 00:19:45.023
Come on!

00:19:53.223 --> 00:19:55.303
This is for dropping
a building on my face.

00:20:13.543 --> 00:20:14.583
Ahh!

00:20:17.543 --> 00:20:19.383
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.

00:20:19.543 --> 00:20:20.583
Who's your buyer?

00:20:20.903 --> 00:20:22.703
You know, he knew you.

00:20:22.863 --> 00:20:24.983
Your pal, your
buddy, your Bucky.

00:20:26.503 --> 00:20:27.503
What did you say?

00:20:27.583 --> 00:20:29.463
He remembered you.

00:20:29.823 --> 00:20:32.463
I was there.
He got all weepy about it.

00:20:33.903 --> 00:20:35.783
Till they put his brain
back in a blender.

00:20:36.623 --> 00:20:38.383
He wanted you to know something.

00:20:38.543 --> 00:20:39.583
He said to me...

00:20:39.983 --> 00:20:42.103
"Please tell Rogers.

00:20:42.663 --> 00:20:44.023
"When you gotta go...

00:20:44.183 --> 00:20:45.943
"you gotta go."

00:20:48.223 --> 00:20:49.383
And you're coming with me.

00:21:06.303 --> 00:21:07.983
Oh, my...

00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:12.023
Sam...

00:21:13.903 --> 00:21:15.223
we need Fire and Rescue

00:21:15.303 --> 00:21:16.903
on the south side
of the building.

00:21:17.463 --> 00:21:18.983
We gotta get up there.

00:21:25.743 --> 00:21:32.503
<i>♪ Try to remember
the kind of September</i>

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:36.343
<i>♪ When grass was green ♪</i>

00:21:37.343 --> 00:21:39.743
Wake up, dear, and say
goodbye to your father.

00:21:39.903 --> 00:21:41.543
Who's the homeless
person on the couch?

00:21:43.023 --> 00:21:45.063
This is why I love coming
home for Christmas...

00:21:45.223 --> 00:21:46.503
right before you leave town.

00:21:46.703 --> 00:21:48.943
Be nice, dear, he's
been studying abroad.

00:21:49.103 --> 00:21:50.903
Really? Which broad?
What's her name?

00:21:51.063 --> 00:21:52.423
Candice.

00:21:52.903 --> 00:21:54.023
Do me a favor?

00:21:54.103 --> 00:21:55.623
Try not to burn the house
down before Monday.

00:21:55.783 --> 00:21:56.943
Okay, so it's Monday.

00:21:57.103 --> 00:21:58.303
That is good to know,

00:21:58.383 --> 00:22:00.263
I will plan my toga
party accordingly.

00:22:01.023 --> 00:22:02.103
Where you going?

00:22:02.303 --> 00:22:03.343
Your father's flying us

00:22:03.423 --> 00:22:04.783
to the Bahamas
for a little getaway.

00:22:04.943 --> 00:22:06.463
We might have to
make a quick stop.

00:22:06.543 --> 00:22:08.703
At the Pentagon. Right?

00:22:08.783 --> 00:22:10.183
Don't worry, you're gonna love

00:22:10.263 --> 00:22:11.863
the holiday menu
at the commissary.

00:22:11.983 --> 00:22:14.703
They say sarcasm is
a metric for potential.

00:22:14.823 --> 00:22:16.703
If that's true, you'll be
a great man someday.

00:22:16.903 --> 00:22:18.223
I'll get the bags.

00:22:20.663 --> 00:22:23.063
He does miss you
when you're not here.

00:22:24.823 --> 00:22:28.103
And frankly, you're
going to miss us.

00:22:28.863 --> 00:22:30.543
Because this is the last time

00:22:30.623 --> 00:22:32.223
we're all going to be together.

00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:35.543
You know what's about to happen.

00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:37.503
Say something.

00:22:37.583 --> 00:22:39.623
If you don't, you'll regret it.

00:22:43.303 --> 00:22:44.823
I love you, Dad.

00:22:45.943 --> 00:22:48.263
And I know you did
the best you could.

00:23:04.103 --> 00:23:06.063
That's how I wish it happened.

00:23:08.503 --> 00:23:11.103
Binarily Augmented
Retro-Framing...

00:23:11.183 --> 00:23:12.303
or BARF.

00:23:12.423 --> 00:23:14.183
God, I gotta work
on that acronym.

00:23:14.263 --> 00:23:16.663
An extremely costly method

00:23:16.743 --> 00:23:18.983
of hijacking the hippocampus...

00:23:19.063 --> 00:23:23.143
to clear traumatic memories.

00:23:25.863 --> 00:23:26.943
Huh.

00:23:27.063 --> 00:23:28.263
It doesn't change the fact

00:23:28.343 --> 00:23:30.183
that they never
made it to the airport...

00:23:30.823 --> 00:23:32.103
or all the things I did to avoid

00:23:32.183 --> 00:23:33.943
processing my grief, but...

00:23:35.863 --> 00:23:40.183
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?

00:23:42.223 --> 00:23:44.943
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.

00:23:46.183 --> 00:23:48.783
Help me out, what's the
MIT mission statement?

00:23:48.943 --> 00:23:50.183
"To generate, disseminate...

00:23:51.583 --> 00:23:53.023
"and preserve knowledge.

00:23:53.663 --> 00:23:55.263
"And work with others...

00:23:55.383 --> 00:23:58.223
"to bring it to bear on the
world's great challenges."

00:23:59.183 --> 00:24:02.063
Well, you are the others.

00:24:03.223 --> 00:24:04.583
And, quiet as it's kept...

00:24:04.663 --> 00:24:06.343
the challenges facing you

00:24:06.423 --> 00:24:07.823
are the greatest
mankind's ever known.

00:24:08.263 --> 00:24:09.383
Plus, most of you are broke.

00:24:10.743 --> 00:24:12.663
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.

00:24:12.823 --> 00:24:14.063
As of this moment...

00:24:14.223 --> 00:24:16.503
every student has been
made an equal recipient...

00:24:16.583 --> 00:24:19.583
of the inaugural September
Foundation Grant.

00:24:19.663 --> 00:24:21.183
As in...

00:24:21.583 --> 00:24:24.183
all of your projects have just
been approved and funded.

00:24:27.423 --> 00:24:30.023
No strings, no taxes...

00:24:30.183 --> 00:24:32.343
just reframe the future!

00:24:32.503 --> 00:24:34.183
Starting now.

00:24:44.063 --> 00:24:45.063
Go break some eggs.

00:24:52.783 --> 00:24:54.503
Wow. Wow.

00:24:56.103 --> 00:24:58.303
That took my breath away.

00:24:58.463 --> 00:24:59.863
Oh, Tony! So generous.

00:25:00.063 --> 00:25:02.223
So much money! Wow!

00:25:02.383 --> 00:25:04.143
Out of curiosity...

00:25:04.303 --> 00:25:07.103
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?

00:25:07.183 --> 00:25:08.543
I know, "Ooh, gross,"
but hear me out.

00:25:08.663 --> 00:25:10.863
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.

00:25:10.943 --> 00:25:12.023
Basically, chemical
detonator embedded...

00:25:12.103 --> 00:25:13.103
Restroom's this way, yeah?

00:25:13.183 --> 00:25:14.303
Yeah.
Embedded in the meat shaft.

00:25:14.383 --> 00:25:16.743
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.

00:25:16.823 --> 00:25:18.223
I didn't know Miss
Potts had canceled.

00:25:18.303 --> 00:25:20.063
They didn't have time to fix it.

00:25:21.703 --> 00:25:23.623
It's fine. I'll be right back.

00:25:23.943 --> 00:25:25.223
We'll catch up later.

00:25:43.343 --> 00:25:46.183
That was nice, what you
did for those young people.

00:25:46.863 --> 00:25:48.343
Ah, they deserve it.

00:25:48.503 --> 00:25:50.663
Plus, it helps ease
my conscience.

00:25:51.263 --> 00:25:55.863
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.

00:25:56.943 --> 00:25:59.503
But if you've got the money...

00:26:00.423 --> 00:26:02.503
break as many eggs as you like.

00:26:03.263 --> 00:26:04.663
Right?

00:26:13.423 --> 00:26:14.423
Are you going up?

00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:16.983
I'm right where I want to be.

00:26:17.583 --> 00:26:18.583
Okay. Hey.

00:26:22.023 --> 00:26:24.823
Sorry, it's an
occupational hazard.

00:26:25.023 --> 00:26:26.623
I work for the State Department.

00:26:27.343 --> 00:26:29.063
Human Resources.

00:26:29.223 --> 00:26:30.983
I know it's boring...

00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:34.903
but it enabled
me to raise a son.

00:26:35.703 --> 00:26:38.703
I'm very proud of
what he grew up to be.

00:26:40.663 --> 00:26:43.183
His name was Charlie Spencer.

00:26:45.623 --> 00:26:46.783
You murdered him.

00:26:48.423 --> 00:26:49.983
In Sokovia.

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:54.543
Not that that matters
in the least to you.

00:26:56.503 --> 00:26:58.703
You think you fight for us?

00:26:59.823 --> 00:27:02.103
You just fight for yourself.

00:27:03.503 --> 00:27:06.823
Who's going to
avenge my son, Stark?

00:27:08.343 --> 00:27:10.023
He's dead...

00:27:10.183 --> 00:27:12.223
and I blame you.

00:27:28.233 --> 00:27:29.433
You like that?

00:27:29.793 --> 00:27:30.913
You like that?

00:27:30.993 --> 00:27:32.393
Come get you some now.

00:27:44.073 --> 00:27:45.193
You didn't even move.

00:27:45.713 --> 00:27:46.713
Nah.

00:27:46.793 --> 00:27:49.033
What if I come in on the left side, right?
Just down here.

00:27:49.113 --> 00:27:50.113
You see this right here?

00:27:58.793 --> 00:28:00.433
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:02.353
I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

00:28:03.873 --> 00:28:06.193
Man, you guys got the
weirdest goodbye rituals.

00:28:06.273 --> 00:28:08.233
All right, break it up.

00:28:08.313 --> 00:28:10.633
Break it up! Break it up!

00:28:27.753 --> 00:28:29.033
Scotty!

00:28:29.113 --> 00:28:30.833
What's up, man!

00:28:30.953 --> 00:28:32.393
Damn! Hey.

00:28:32.473 --> 00:28:34.753
Ha-ha! Hey, man.

00:28:36.553 --> 00:28:37.873
Hey, what's up with your eye?

00:28:37.953 --> 00:28:41.073
Oh. Well, what do you think?
Peachy. It's a going-away present.

00:28:41.153 --> 00:28:43.033
Oh, yeah.
I still got my scar from a year ago.

00:28:43.113 --> 00:28:45.073
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:28:45.753 --> 00:28:48.273
You know what?
I'm still the only one who knocked him out.

00:28:48.353 --> 00:28:50.473
Well, I definitely didn't.

00:28:51.233 --> 00:28:52.593
Thanks for picking
me up, brother.

00:28:52.673 --> 00:28:55.153
Bro, you think I'm gonna
miss my celly getting out?

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:56.553
Hey, how's your girl, man?

00:28:56.633 --> 00:28:57.793
Oh, she left me.

00:28:58.153 --> 00:28:59.393
Oh.

00:28:59.513 --> 00:29:00.713
Yeah, my ma died, too.

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:03.033
And my dad got deported.

00:29:04.473 --> 00:29:05.673
But I got the van!

00:29:05.753 --> 00:29:07.273
It's nice. Yeah, right?

00:29:07.793 --> 00:29:10.153
- Thanks for the hook-up, too.
- I needed a place to stay.

00:29:10.233 --> 00:29:12.513
You wait till you see this couch.
You're gonna be really happy.

00:29:12.593 --> 00:29:14.073
You're gonna be on your feet in no time.
Watch.

00:29:14.153 --> 00:29:15.593
I hope so. Yeah.

00:29:15.673 --> 00:29:16.953
And I gotta
introduce you to some

00:29:17.073 --> 00:29:18.273
people.
Some really skilled people.

00:29:18.353 --> 00:29:19.993
- Not interested.
- Yeah, right.

00:29:20.073 --> 00:29:22.393
No, I'm serious, man.
I'm not going back.

00:29:24.313 --> 00:29:25.953
I got a daughter
to take care of.

00:29:26.033 --> 00:29:28.233
You know that jobs don't
come easy for ex-cons, right?

00:29:28.313 --> 00:29:31.233
Look, man, I got a master's in
electrical engineering, all right?

00:29:31.993 --> 00:29:33.153
I'm gonna be fine.

00:29:36.513 --> 00:29:37.793
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.

00:29:37.873 --> 00:29:39.873
Would you like to try
our Mango Fruit Blast?

00:29:39.953 --> 00:29:40.953
Uh, no, thanks.

00:29:41.353 --> 00:29:44.473
Um, I will have...
I'll have a burger, please.

00:29:44.553 --> 00:29:47.113
Oh, we don't...
We don't make that.

00:29:47.193 --> 00:29:50.073
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

00:29:50.193 --> 00:29:51.993
It's ice cream. Baskin-Robbins.

00:29:53.393 --> 00:29:55.593
I'll just do, like,
whatever's hot and fresh.

00:29:56.273 --> 00:29:57.273
Dude.

00:29:57.353 --> 00:29:59.113
Can I see you in the back, chief?
Pronto.

00:29:59.193 --> 00:30:00.793
Sure thing, Dale.

00:30:01.753 --> 00:30:04.633
Darby, could you just, uh,
take care of this idiot? Thanks.

00:30:07.913 --> 00:30:09.593
Hey, Dale. Come on in.

00:30:10.113 --> 00:30:11.393
Pull up some chair.

00:30:13.913 --> 00:30:16.073
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

00:30:16.153 --> 00:30:17.313
You found out.

00:30:17.433 --> 00:30:19.673
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

00:30:19.753 --> 00:30:22.113
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
But I...

00:30:22.633 --> 00:30:23.793
No one would hire me.

00:30:23.873 --> 00:30:26.313
Breaking and entering.
Grand larceny.

00:30:26.393 --> 00:30:28.593
Look, I'm sorry.

00:30:28.673 --> 00:30:30.153
I don't do it anymore. I just...

00:30:30.233 --> 00:30:31.233
Respect.

00:30:32.433 --> 00:30:33.473
I couldn't be happier about it.

00:30:33.553 --> 00:30:34.953
Really? Yeah.

00:30:35.073 --> 00:30:37.033
Thank you. Thank you.

00:30:37.113 --> 00:30:39.673
You really stuck it to
those billionaire SOBs.

00:30:39.753 --> 00:30:42.273
The more I read about
what you did and stuff...

00:30:42.353 --> 00:30:44.833
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?

00:30:44.913 --> 00:30:47.033
"I'm in charge of this guy?"

00:30:47.113 --> 00:30:49.473
Well, I'm very
happy in this job,

00:30:49.553 --> 00:30:51.833
and I really just appreciate
the opportunity to...

00:30:51.913 --> 00:30:53.393
Well, you're fired, of course.

00:30:55.833 --> 00:30:57.153
I can't really keep you on.

00:30:57.233 --> 00:30:58.953
Wait, what? Fired?

00:30:59.033 --> 00:31:00.113
Yeah.

00:31:00.193 --> 00:31:02.193
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.
I mean, I'm a good worker.

00:31:02.313 --> 00:31:05.153
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
It was a cool crime.

00:31:05.273 --> 00:31:06.553
I'll tell you what, though.

00:31:06.633 --> 00:31:09.793
This will be totally off
the books, off the records,

00:31:09.873 --> 00:31:12.833
but if you want to grab one
of those Mango Fruit Blasts

00:31:12.913 --> 00:31:14.273
on your way out the door,

00:31:14.353 --> 00:31:16.753
I'll just pretend
I didn't see it.

00:31:55.313 --> 00:31:56.633
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

00:31:57.233 --> 00:31:58.953
I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

00:31:59.033 --> 00:32:00.833
I was. I got fired.

00:32:00.953 --> 00:32:02.673
Damn. They find out who you are?

00:32:02.753 --> 00:32:03.713
Yeah.

00:32:03.833 --> 00:32:05.593
Baskin-Robbins
always finds out, bro.

00:32:05.673 --> 00:32:07.593
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

00:32:07.673 --> 00:32:09.233
You want some waffles?

00:32:09.353 --> 00:32:10.913
Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

00:32:11.033 --> 00:32:12.393
Oh. That's Kurt.

00:32:12.473 --> 00:32:14.713
He was Folsom for five years.
He's a wizard on that laptop.

00:32:15.793 --> 00:32:16.913
Nice meet you.

00:32:17.033 --> 00:32:18.153
Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

00:32:19.073 --> 00:32:20.113
Who are you?

00:32:20.473 --> 00:32:21.513
Dave.

00:32:22.833 --> 00:32:24.433
Nice work on the Vista job.

00:32:25.353 --> 00:32:26.673
Vista job, yes.

00:32:26.753 --> 00:32:29.193
No, no.
I have heard of this robbery.

00:32:29.273 --> 00:32:32.673
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

00:32:32.753 --> 00:32:35.433
I hate violence. I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

00:32:35.513 --> 00:32:36.953
You mean you're a pussy.

00:32:37.033 --> 00:32:38.153
Yeah.

00:32:38.233 --> 00:32:40.073
They were overcharging
the customers, right?

00:32:40.153 --> 00:32:41.593
And it added up to millions.

00:32:41.673 --> 00:32:43.553
He blows the whistle
and he gets fired.

00:32:44.113 --> 00:32:45.393
And what does he do?

00:32:45.473 --> 00:32:47.393
He hacks into the
security system

00:32:47.473 --> 00:32:50.153
and transfers millions back to
the people that they stole it from.

00:32:50.233 --> 00:32:52.113
Posts all the bank
records online.

00:32:52.193 --> 00:32:54.033
And he drove the dude's
Bentley into his swimming pool.

00:32:57.033 --> 00:32:58.873
What are you doing?

00:32:58.953 --> 00:32:59.993
Hmm?

00:33:00.833 --> 00:33:03.073
Why are you telling my
life story to these guys?

00:33:03.153 --> 00:33:04.393
What do you want?

00:33:04.513 --> 00:33:05.473
Okay.

00:33:05.553 --> 00:33:07.993
My cousin talked to
this guy two weeks ago

00:33:08.073 --> 00:33:09.153
about this little perfect job.

00:33:09.273 --> 00:33:10.313
No way.

00:33:10.393 --> 00:33:12.793
No, no, no. Wait! This guy...
This guy fits your M.O.

00:33:12.873 --> 00:33:13.873
No!

00:33:13.953 --> 00:33:16.273
I'm finished, man.
I'm not going back to jail.

00:33:16.353 --> 00:33:18.393
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

00:33:18.473 --> 00:33:20.433
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

00:33:20.513 --> 00:33:22.553
I don't care. I'm out.

00:33:47.523 --> 00:33:49.203
<i>Scattered riots broke out</i>

00:33:49.283 --> 00:33:50.683
<i>across the Kree Empire today</i>

00:33:50.763 --> 00:33:54.363
<i>protesting the recent peace
treaty signed by the Kree Emperor</i>

00:33:54.443 --> 00:33:56.763
<i>and Xandar's Nova Prime.</i>

00:33:59.363 --> 00:34:00.723
Peter, you have call.

00:34:01.603 --> 00:34:03.323
- No, wait, don't!
<i>- Quill?</i>

00:34:05.723 --> 00:34:06.963
Hey, Yondu.

00:34:07.283 --> 00:34:09.283
<i>I'm here on Morag.</i>

00:34:09.403 --> 00:34:10.523
<i>Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.</i>

00:34:10.603 --> 00:34:12.763
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

00:34:12.843 --> 00:34:14.243
<i>Well, where are you at now, boy?</i>

00:34:14.323 --> 00:34:16.803
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

00:34:16.883 --> 00:34:19.483
<i>- I slaved putting this deal together.</i>
- Slaved?

00:34:19.563 --> 00:34:20.603
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

00:34:20.683 --> 00:34:21.683
<i>And now you're gonna rip me off!</i>

00:34:21.803 --> 00:34:25.363
<i>We do not do that to each other.
We're Ravagers. We got a code.</i>

00:34:25.483 --> 00:34:28.203
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

00:34:28.323 --> 00:34:29.603
<i>When I picked you up on Terra...</i>

00:34:29.683 --> 00:34:30.683
"Picked me up."

00:34:30.803 --> 00:34:31.723
<i>...these boys of mine
wanted to eat you.</i>

00:34:31.803 --> 00:34:32.803
Yeah?

00:34:32.883 --> 00:34:34.323
<i>They ain't never tasted
any Terran before.</i>

00:34:34.443 --> 00:34:36.603
<i>I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!</i>

00:34:36.683 --> 00:34:37.883
<i>I will find you, I will...</i>

00:34:38.683 --> 00:34:40.363
Put a bounty on him!

00:34:40.843 --> 00:34:42.003
Forty K.

00:34:42.283 --> 00:34:43.723
- But I want him back alive.
- Yeah, Cap.

00:34:43.803 --> 00:34:45.403
- Alive?
- That's what I said.

00:34:45.483 --> 00:34:46.763
I told you when you
picked that kid up,

00:34:46.883 --> 00:34:48.843
you should have delivered
him like we was hired to do!

00:34:48.963 --> 00:34:50.563
He was cargo!

00:34:50.683 --> 00:34:52.363
You have always
been soft on him.

00:34:52.443 --> 00:34:54.883
You're the only one
I'm being soft on!

00:34:55.483 --> 00:34:57.843
Now, don't you
worry about Mr. Quill.

00:34:58.443 --> 00:35:00.443
As soon as we get him back here,

00:35:00.883 --> 00:35:03.403
I'm gonna kill him myself.

00:35:03.723 --> 00:35:05.003
What we do need to worry about,

00:35:06.523 --> 00:35:08.843
is who else out
there wants that Orb!

00:35:29.363 --> 00:35:31.563
<i>They call me "terrorist,"</i>

00:35:32.283 --> 00:35:34.803
<i>"radical," "zealot,"</i>

00:35:35.683 --> 00:35:38.803
<i>because I obey the ancient
laws of my people, the Kree,</i>

00:35:39.723 --> 00:35:43.003
<i>and punish those who do not.</i>

00:35:43.323 --> 00:35:46.403
<i>Because I do not
forgive your people</i>

00:35:46.523 --> 00:35:48.923
<i>for taking the
life of my father,</i>

00:35:49.603 --> 00:35:52.963
<i>and his father, and
his father before him.</i>

00:35:54.363 --> 00:35:58.843
<i>A thousand years of war
between us will not be forgotten!</i>

00:35:59.403 --> 00:36:02.083
You can't do this!
Our government signed a peace treaty.

00:36:03.403 --> 00:36:05.643
My government knows no shame.

00:36:06.723 --> 00:36:09.563
You Xandarians and
your culture are a disease.

00:36:10.923 --> 00:36:11.923
You

00:36:12.043 --> 00:36:14.443
will never rule Xandar.

00:36:14.523 --> 00:36:15.563
No.

00:36:16.443 --> 00:36:18.603
I will cure it!

00:36:31.763 --> 00:36:32.803
Ronan,

00:36:32.923 --> 00:36:34.803
Korath has returned.

00:36:34.923 --> 00:36:37.763
Master, he is a thief,

00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:40.403
an outlaw who calls
himself Star-Lord.

00:36:40.483 --> 00:36:42.883
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

00:36:43.003 --> 00:36:45.803
to retrieve the Orb for
an intermediary known

00:36:45.963 --> 00:36:47.523
as The Broker.

00:36:47.603 --> 00:36:51.003
I promised Thanos I would
retrieve the Orb for him.

00:36:51.083 --> 00:36:53.723
Only then will he
destroy Xandar for me.

00:36:54.683 --> 00:36:57.963
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the Orb.

00:36:58.803 --> 00:36:59.923
It will be my honor.

00:37:00.003 --> 00:37:01.043
It will be your doom.

00:37:02.523 --> 00:37:04.843
If this happens again,
you'll be facing our father

00:37:04.963 --> 00:37:06.723
without his prize.

00:37:06.803 --> 00:37:08.443
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

00:37:08.843 --> 00:37:09.963
Just like you.

00:37:10.043 --> 00:37:11.483
But I know Xandar.

00:37:11.603 --> 00:37:13.123
Ronan has already
decreed that I...

00:37:13.443 --> 00:37:14.443
Do not speak for me.

00:37:16.803 --> 00:37:18.803
You will not fail.

00:37:22.643 --> 00:37:24.123
Have I ever?

00:37:26.391 --> 00:37:27.591
<i>11 Wakandans were</i>

00:37:27.671 --> 00:37:29.791
<i>among those killed
during a confrontation...</i>

00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:32.111
<i>between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...</i>

00:37:32.191 --> 00:37:34.231
<i>in Lagos, Nigeria last month.</i>

00:37:34.311 --> 00:37:35.711
<i>The traditionally
reclusive Wakandans</i>

00:37:35.831 --> 00:37:37.151
<i>were on an outreach mission...</i>

00:37:37.231 --> 00:37:39.031
<i>in Lagos, when
the attack occurred.</i>

00:37:39.111 --> 00:37:42.431
<i>Our people's blood is
spilled on foreign soil...</i>

00:37:43.151 --> 00:37:46.191
<i>not only because of
the actions of criminals...</i>

00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:50.191
<i>but by the indifference of
those pledged to stop them.</i>

00:37:50.271 --> 00:37:53.231
<i>Victory at the expense
of the innocent...</i>

00:37:53.511 --> 00:37:55.831
<i>is no victory at all.</i>

00:37:55.911 --> 00:37:57.471
<i>The Wakandan king went on to...</i>

00:37:57.711 --> 00:37:59.151
<i>They are operating outside</i>

00:37:59.271 --> 00:38:00.991
<i>and above the international law.</i>

00:38:01.071 --> 00:38:02.271
<i>Because that's the reality,</i>

00:38:02.351 --> 00:38:03.951
<i>if we don't respond
to acts like these.</i>

00:38:04.151 --> 00:38:06.071
<i>What legal authority
does an enhanced</i>

00:38:06.191 --> 00:38:07.951
<i>individual like Wanda
Maximoff have...</i>

00:38:08.071 --> 00:38:09.391
<i>to operate in Nigeri...?</i>

00:38:14.151 --> 00:38:15.471
It's my fault.

00:38:15.631 --> 00:38:16.631
That's not true.

00:38:16.791 --> 00:38:17.831
Turn the TV back on.

00:38:17.991 --> 00:38:19.991
They're being very specific.

00:38:20.351 --> 00:38:21.631
I should've clocked
that bomb vest

00:38:21.751 --> 00:38:23.671
long before you
had to deal with it.

00:38:24.871 --> 00:38:26.431
Rumlow said "Bucky"...

00:38:27.951 --> 00:38:29.751
and all of a sudden I was
a 16-year-old kid again,

00:38:29.831 --> 00:38:30.911
in Brooklyn.

00:38:35.151 --> 00:38:36.751
And people died.

00:38:38.991 --> 00:38:39.991
It's on me.

00:38:40.591 --> 00:38:42.231
It's on both of us.

00:38:43.311 --> 00:38:44.671
This job...

00:38:47.751 --> 00:38:49.671
We try to save as
many people as we can.

00:38:50.671 --> 00:38:52.351
Sometimes that
doesn't mean everybody.

00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:54.431
But if we can't find a
way to live with that...

00:38:54.591 --> 00:38:56.511
then next time...

00:38:57.831 --> 00:38:59.631
maybe nobody gets saved.

00:39:03.671 --> 00:39:05.671
Vis! We talked about this.

00:39:05.791 --> 00:39:08.471
Yes, but the door was
open so I assumed that...

00:39:10.191 --> 00:39:13.191
Captain Rogers wished to
know when Mr. Stark was arriving.

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:14.871
Thank you. We'll be right down.

00:39:15.351 --> 00:39:17.551
I'll use the door.

00:39:18.551 --> 00:39:20.871
Oh, and apparently,
he's brought a guest.

00:39:21.031 --> 00:39:22.711
We know who it is?

00:39:22.871 --> 00:39:24.711
The Secretary of State.

00:39:27.871 --> 00:39:29.551
<i>Five years ago...</i>

00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:31.831
I had a heart attack...

00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:35.151
and dropped right in the
middle of my backswing.

00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:38.231
Turned out it was the
best round of my life...

00:39:38.391 --> 00:39:40.551
because after 13
hours of surgery

00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:42.391
and a triple bypass...

00:39:43.351 --> 00:39:45.231
I found something 40 years

00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:47.191
in the Army had never taught me.

00:39:47.871 --> 00:39:49.071
Perspective.

00:39:51.191 --> 00:39:55.071
The world owes the
Avengers an unpayable debt.

00:39:55.911 --> 00:39:58.911
You have fought for us...

00:39:59.071 --> 00:40:02.071
protected us,
risked your lives...

00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:06.351
but while a great many
people see you as heroes...

00:40:06.511 --> 00:40:08.071
there are some...

00:40:09.871 --> 00:40:11.871
who would prefer
the word "vigilantes."

00:40:12.071 --> 00:40:14.351
What word would you
use, Mr. Secretary?

00:40:14.511 --> 00:40:15.711
How about "dangerous"?

00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:19.111
What would you call
a group of US-based,

00:40:19.191 --> 00:40:21.271
enhanced individuals...

00:40:21.431 --> 00:40:24.431
who routinely ignore
sovereign borders...

00:40:24.591 --> 00:40:28.231
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...

00:40:28.391 --> 00:40:30.511
and who, frankly,
seem unconcerned

00:40:30.631 --> 00:40:31.951
about what they leave behind?

00:40:36.871 --> 00:40:38.471
New York.

00:40:52.271 --> 00:40:54.071
Washington, D.C.

00:41:02.151 --> 00:41:03.631
Sokovia.

00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:15.471
Lagos.

00:41:24.831 --> 00:41:26.511
Okay. That's enough.

00:41:28.671 --> 00:41:29.751
For the past four years,

00:41:29.831 --> 00:41:31.191
you've operated
with unlimited power...

00:41:31.351 --> 00:41:33.191
and no supervision.

00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:35.111
That's an arrangement the
governments of the world

00:41:35.191 --> 00:41:37.191
can no longer tolerate.

00:41:39.671 --> 00:41:42.111
But I think we have a solution.

00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:48.191
The Sokovia Accords.

00:41:48.871 --> 00:41:51.471
Approved by 117 countries...

00:41:51.671 --> 00:41:54.511
it states that the Avengers

00:41:54.631 --> 00:41:57.191
shall no longer be a
private organization.

00:41:57.351 --> 00:41:58.551
Instead...

00:41:58.711 --> 00:42:00.871
they'll operate
under the supervision

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.871
of a United Nations panel...

00:42:03.031 --> 00:42:07.511
only when and if that
panel deems it necessary.

00:42:08.671 --> 00:42:11.551
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.

00:42:12.031 --> 00:42:13.231
I feel we've done that.

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:15.471
Tell me, Captain, do you know

00:42:15.551 --> 00:42:17.511
where Thor and
Banner are right now?

00:42:19.031 --> 00:42:21.351
If I misplaced a couple
of 30 megaton nukes...

00:42:21.511 --> 00:42:23.831
you can bet there'd
be consequences.

00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:28.511
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.

00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:31.551
Believe me, this is
the middle ground.

00:42:32.551 --> 00:42:35.311
So, there are contingencies.

00:42:35.671 --> 00:42:38.311
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...

00:42:38.471 --> 00:42:40.471
to ratify the Accords.

00:42:42.671 --> 00:42:44.231
Talk it over.

00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:49.591
And if we come to a
decision you don't like?

00:42:51.551 --> 00:42:53.271
Then you retire.

00:43:00.734 --> 00:43:02.254
Daddy!

00:43:02.334 --> 00:43:03.774
Peanut! Oh!

00:43:03.854 --> 00:43:06.094
Happy birthday!

00:43:06.174 --> 00:43:07.134
I'm so sorry I'm late.

00:43:07.214 --> 00:43:08.774
I didn't know what
time your party started.

00:43:08.854 --> 00:43:10.414
It was on the invitation.

00:43:10.494 --> 00:43:12.254
He didn't get an invitation.

00:43:12.334 --> 00:43:13.814
But he came anyway!

00:43:13.894 --> 00:43:16.894
Well, I'm not gonna miss
my little girl's birthday party.

00:43:16.974 --> 00:43:18.734
I'm gonna go tell
Mommy you're here.

00:43:18.814 --> 00:43:19.814
Oh, you don't...

00:43:19.894 --> 00:43:20.894
What are you doing here, Lang?

00:43:20.974 --> 00:43:22.454
You haven't paid a
dime of child support.

00:43:22.574 --> 00:43:24.254
You know, right now, if I
wanted to, I could arrest you.

00:43:24.334 --> 00:43:25.334
It's good to see
you too, Paxton.

00:43:25.414 --> 00:43:28.774
Mommy's so happy you're
here, she choked on her drink.

00:43:30.294 --> 00:43:33.054
Hey, look what I have for you.

00:43:33.134 --> 00:43:34.494
Can I open it now?

00:43:34.574 --> 00:43:36.334
Of course, sweetheart.
It's your birthday.

00:43:40.614 --> 00:43:42.294
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

00:43:42.374 --> 00:43:43.494
What is that thing?

00:43:43.574 --> 00:43:45.294
He's so ugly!

00:43:45.814 --> 00:43:47.814
I love him!

00:43:47.894 --> 00:43:49.494
Can I go show my friends?

00:43:49.574 --> 00:43:51.454
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

00:43:52.134 --> 00:43:53.734
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

00:43:53.814 --> 00:43:55.974
Look, the child support
is coming, all right?

00:43:56.054 --> 00:43:58.014
It's just hard finding a job
when you have a record.

00:43:58.094 --> 00:44:00.854
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
But for now, I want you out of my house.

00:44:00.934 --> 00:44:02.454
No way! It's my daughter's birthday.
It's my house!

00:44:02.534 --> 00:44:03.814
- So what? It's my kid!
- Scott!

00:44:05.094 --> 00:44:07.494
You can't just show up here.
You know that. Come on.

00:44:07.574 --> 00:44:08.614
It's a birthday party.

00:44:08.694 --> 00:44:10.374
Yeah, I know, but
you can't just show up.

00:44:10.454 --> 00:44:11.414
She's my daughter.

00:44:11.494 --> 00:44:12.934
You don't know the first
thing about being a father.

00:44:13.014 --> 00:44:14.974
Maggie, I tell you
this as a friend,

00:44:15.094 --> 00:44:17.054
and as the first
love of my life.

00:44:17.174 --> 00:44:19.094
Your fiance is an asshat.

00:44:19.214 --> 00:44:20.254
He's not an asshat.

00:44:20.334 --> 00:44:21.734
Hey, watch your language. Okay?

00:44:21.854 --> 00:44:23.214
What language? I said "hat."

00:44:23.294 --> 00:44:24.654
Stop it.

00:44:25.974 --> 00:44:28.014
Really, Maggie? That guy?

00:44:28.094 --> 00:44:29.694
Come on!
You could marry anyone you want,

00:44:29.774 --> 00:44:31.094
and you have to get
engaged to a cop?

00:44:31.174 --> 00:44:32.774
At least he's not a crook.

00:44:34.614 --> 00:44:37.414
I'm trying, okay?
I've changed. I'm straight.

00:44:37.494 --> 00:44:39.854
I had a job and...

00:44:41.414 --> 00:44:42.454
I wanna provide.

00:44:42.534 --> 00:44:45.054
I had a lot of time to think
about it and I love her.

00:44:45.134 --> 00:44:46.174
So much.

00:44:46.254 --> 00:44:49.574
I've missed so much time
and I wanna be a part of her life.

00:44:49.654 --> 00:44:50.654
What do I do?

00:44:51.454 --> 00:44:52.694
Get an apartment,

00:44:53.254 --> 00:44:55.694
get a job, pay child support.

00:44:55.774 --> 00:44:58.974
And then we will talk
about visitation, I promise.

00:44:59.494 --> 00:45:01.494
You're her hero, Scott.

00:45:02.454 --> 00:45:06.654
Just be the person that
she already thinks you are.

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:41.270
Ooh.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.030
Stop cheating.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.350
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.590
Maybe he didn't hear you.

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:49.670
How was the party?

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.750
Tell me about that tip.

00:46:11.022 --> 00:46:12.342
Xandarians.

00:46:12.462 --> 00:46:14.822
What a bunch of losers.

00:46:14.902 --> 00:46:19.222
All of them in a big hurry to
get from something stupid,

00:46:19.422 --> 00:46:21.342
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

00:46:21.902 --> 00:46:22.902
Look at this guy!

00:46:22.982 --> 00:46:24.422
Can you believe
they call us criminals,

00:46:24.502 --> 00:46:26.422
when he's assaulting
us with that haircut?

00:46:27.022 --> 00:46:29.862
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

00:46:29.942 --> 00:46:33.382
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

00:46:33.542 --> 00:46:35.462
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

00:46:36.182 --> 00:46:39.942
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

00:46:40.262 --> 00:46:42.102
Right, Groot?

00:46:42.542 --> 00:46:43.782
Groot?

00:46:43.862 --> 00:46:45.542
Don't drink fountain
water, you idiot.

00:46:45.862 --> 00:46:48.022
- That's disgusting!
- Mmm.

00:46:48.382 --> 00:46:50.302
Yes, you did.
I just saw you doing it.

00:46:50.382 --> 00:46:51.502
Why are you lying?

00:46:51.782 --> 00:46:53.062
Whoop.

00:46:55.142 --> 00:46:57.142
Looks like we got one.

00:46:57.262 --> 00:47:01.262
Okay, humie, how bad does
someone wanna find you?

00:47:02.862 --> 00:47:06.982
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

00:47:20.982 --> 00:47:22.262
- Mr. Quill.
- Broker.

00:47:23.542 --> 00:47:24.542
The Orb.

00:47:26.422 --> 00:47:28.582
- As commissioned.
- Where's Yondu?

00:47:28.862 --> 00:47:30.422
Wanted to be here.
Sends his love.

00:47:30.542 --> 00:47:31.542
And told me to tell you,

00:47:31.822 --> 00:47:34.022
that you got the best
eyebrows in the business.

00:47:36.182 --> 00:47:37.222
What is it?

00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:41.302
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

00:47:41.382 --> 00:47:43.382
Yeah, well, I almost
died getting it for you.

00:47:43.462 --> 00:47:46.422
An occupational hazard,
I'm sure, in your line of work.

00:47:47.182 --> 00:47:49.382
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

00:47:50.942 --> 00:47:52.862
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

00:47:52.942 --> 00:47:53.982
I truly am.

00:47:54.062 --> 00:47:55.622
But I want no part
of this transaction

00:47:55.862 --> 00:47:57.622
- if Ronan is involved.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:47:58.622 --> 00:47:59.942
Who's Ronan?

00:48:00.062 --> 00:48:03.222
A Kree fanatic, outraged
by the peace treaty,

00:48:03.342 --> 00:48:07.582
who will not rest until
Xandarian culture, my culture,

00:48:07.862 --> 00:48:08.982
- is wiped from existence!
- Whoa, whoa!

00:48:09.062 --> 00:48:10.382
- Come on.
- He's someone

00:48:10.502 --> 00:48:11.942
whose bad side
I'd rather not be on.

00:48:12.102 --> 00:48:13.622
What? What about my bad side?

00:48:13.902 --> 00:48:15.142
Farewell, Mr. Quill.

00:48:17.342 --> 00:48:18.942
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

00:48:24.982 --> 00:48:26.022
What happened?

00:48:28.222 --> 00:48:31.142
Ah, this guy just backed
out of a deal on me.

00:48:31.302 --> 00:48:33.342
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a man without integrity.

00:48:33.462 --> 00:48:35.222
Peter Quill.
People call me Star-Lord.

00:48:36.662 --> 00:48:39.022
You have the bearing
of a man of honor.

00:48:39.142 --> 00:48:41.222
Well, you know, I
wouldn't say that.

00:48:42.102 --> 00:48:44.982
People say it about
me, all the time,

00:48:45.102 --> 00:48:46.502
but it's not something I
would ever say about myself.

00:48:48.382 --> 00:48:49.502
Ooh!

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:06.462
This wasn't the plan.

00:49:07.222 --> 00:49:08.422
Ah!

00:49:09.102 --> 00:49:11.222
Put him in the bag.
Put him in the bag!

00:49:11.342 --> 00:49:13.542
No! Not her, him!

00:49:13.702 --> 00:49:15.182
Learn genders, man.

00:49:15.542 --> 00:49:16.982
Ow!

00:49:17.062 --> 00:49:18.662
Biting? That's not fair!

00:49:22.182 --> 00:49:23.942
Take it easy!

00:49:30.462 --> 00:49:31.542
Ow!

00:49:52.542 --> 00:49:54.262
Fool. You should have learned.

00:49:54.382 --> 00:49:56.222
I don't learn. One of my issues.

00:50:04.982 --> 00:50:06.502
What the...

00:50:09.742 --> 00:50:12.982
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

00:50:14.222 --> 00:50:15.622
You gotta be kidding me.

00:50:15.702 --> 00:50:17.462
Ooh. Hey!

00:50:35.222 --> 00:50:37.542
I live for the simple things.

00:50:37.702 --> 00:50:40.062
Like how much
this is gonna hurt.

00:50:44.782 --> 00:50:46.782
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

00:50:49.102 --> 00:50:50.462
It'll grow back,
you d'ast idiot.

00:50:50.582 --> 00:50:52.182
Quit whining.

00:51:00.462 --> 00:51:03.622
<i>Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.</i>

00:51:04.382 --> 00:51:05.782
Aw, crap.

00:51:06.102 --> 00:51:07.422
By the authority
of the Nova Corps,

00:51:07.502 --> 00:51:09.342
- you are under arrest...
- All right. Come on up.

00:51:09.422 --> 00:51:11.542
<i>...for endangerment to life
and the destruction of property.</i>

00:51:11.622 --> 00:51:14.742
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

00:51:15.062 --> 00:51:18.222
- Star-Lord.
- Oh, sorry. "Lord."

00:51:18.342 --> 00:51:20.382
I picked this guy up a
while back for petty theft.

00:51:20.502 --> 00:51:22.062
He's got a code name.

00:51:22.142 --> 00:51:23.142
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

00:51:23.222 --> 00:51:25.102
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:26.742
Just relax, pal.

00:51:26.822 --> 00:51:29.182
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

00:51:30.582 --> 00:51:32.182
Fascists.

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.700
<i>Ronan is destroying</i>

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.140
<i>Xandarian outposts
throughout the galaxy.</i>

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:53.220
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:54.820
<i>We signed your peace
treaty, Nova Prime.</i>

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.260
<i>What more do you want?</i>

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.140
At least a statement
from the Kree Empire

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.420
saying that they
condemn his actions.

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.900
He is slaughtering children.

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.540
Families.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.900
<i>That is your business.</i>

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.180
<i>Now, I have other
matters to attend to.</i>

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:11.540
Prick.

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.260
Well, some good news.

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.420
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

00:52:19.616 --> 00:52:22.096
<i>You have been betrayed, Ronan.</i>

00:52:22.696 --> 00:52:24.456
We know only that
she has been captured.

00:52:25.456 --> 00:52:27.496
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

00:52:27.576 --> 00:52:31.856
<i>No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.</i>

00:52:31.976 --> 00:52:34.656
<i>Look, your
partnership with Thanos</i>

00:52:34.776 --> 00:52:36.576
<i>is at risk.</i>

00:52:37.496 --> 00:52:40.976
<i>Thanos requires your presence.
Now!</i>

00:52:46.936 --> 00:52:50.656
With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

00:52:50.736 --> 00:52:52.176
and yet you summon me.

00:52:52.416 --> 00:52:54.176
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

00:52:54.416 --> 00:52:56.456
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

00:52:56.536 --> 00:52:58.176
Thanos put Gamora
under your charge.

00:52:58.496 --> 00:53:01.096
Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

00:53:01.416 --> 00:53:03.096
You are the one here
with nothing to show for it.

00:53:03.176 --> 00:53:07.416
Your sources say that she
meant to betray us the whole time!

00:53:07.496 --> 00:53:08.696
Lower your tone!

00:53:08.856 --> 00:53:09.856
I may be your...

00:53:18.016 --> 00:53:21.936
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

00:53:23.016 --> 00:53:26.816
The only matter I do
not take seriously, boy,

00:53:27.136 --> 00:53:28.536
is you.

00:53:29.136 --> 00:53:31.736
Your politics bore me.

00:53:31.856 --> 00:53:34.936
Your demeanor is
that of a pouty child.

00:53:35.016 --> 00:53:39.776
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

00:53:42.216 --> 00:53:45.216
I shall honor our
agreement, Kree,

00:53:45.496 --> 00:53:47.136
if you bring me the Orb.

00:53:48.056 --> 00:53:50.696
But return to me
again empty-handed,

00:53:51.136 --> 00:53:54.056
and I will bathe the
starways in your blood.

00:53:57.576 --> 00:53:59.216
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

00:54:01.696 --> 00:54:04.496
This is one fight you won't win.

00:54:05.656 --> 00:54:07.216
Let's head to the Kyln.
