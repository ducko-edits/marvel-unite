00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.946
Master Kaecilius.

00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:03.666
That ritual will bring
you only sorrow.

00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:40.306
Hypocrite!

00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:44.203
I thought we were using mice.

00:04:45.043 --> 00:04:46.203
What's the difference?

00:04:47.563 --> 00:04:52.443
Commence Experiment 34-C.
Organic atomic reduction.

00:04:52.523 --> 00:04:54.363
Darren, maybe we should think...

00:04:54.443 --> 00:04:56.923
Shrinking organic tissue is the
centerpiece of this technology.

00:04:57.003 --> 00:04:59.003
I can't go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:27.763
Experiment 34-C results,

00:05:27.843 --> 00:05:28.883
negative.

00:05:33.243 --> 00:05:36.843
Sanitize the work station.
Bring in subject 35-C.

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:40.099
<i>You're my bestest friend!</i>

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:42.139
Are you sure you don't
want a different toy?

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.179
No, I love this one.

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.499
Okay. Well, get some sleep.
I love you.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.539
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:51.939
Is Daddy a bad man?

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:55.339
I heard some
grownups say he's bad.

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:57.459
No.

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:01.339
Daddy just gets confused
sometimes, you know?

00:06:02.584 --> 00:06:03.864
<i>You know, you almost
had us convinced</i>

00:06:03.944 --> 00:06:06.024
that you were gonna
change your ways.

00:06:06.624 --> 00:06:08.784
They were really
rooting for you.

00:06:10.384 --> 00:06:12.424
It's gonna break their hearts.

00:06:14.684 --> 00:06:15.844
You got a visitor.

00:06:15.964 --> 00:06:17.084
Who?

00:06:17.524 --> 00:06:18.524
Your lawyer.

00:06:19.324 --> 00:06:20.644
My lawyer?

00:06:23.764 --> 00:06:26.204
I told you I'd be
in touch, Scott.

00:06:27.004 --> 00:06:30.684
I'm starting to think that you
prefer the inside of a jail cell.

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:32.524
Oh, man.

00:06:33.044 --> 00:06:34.204
Sit down.

00:06:37.884 --> 00:06:40.884
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

00:06:40.964 --> 00:06:42.804
I don't even wanna
know why you have it.

00:06:42.884 --> 00:06:44.884
Maggie was right about you.

00:06:46.484 --> 00:06:47.444
How do you know about...

00:06:47.564 --> 00:06:49.364
No wonder she's trying to
keep you away from Cassie.

00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:52.564
The moment things get hard,

00:06:52.644 --> 00:06:54.044
you turn right back to crime.

00:06:56.564 --> 00:06:58.764
The way I see it,
you have a choice.

00:06:58.844 --> 00:07:01.444
You can either spend the
rest of your life in prison,

00:07:02.324 --> 00:07:04.164
or go back to your cell

00:07:04.724 --> 00:07:07.204
and await further instructions.

00:07:07.284 --> 00:07:08.724
I don't understand.

00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:10.964
No, I don't expect you to.

00:07:11.044 --> 00:07:14.084
But you don't have many
options right now, and quite frankly,

00:07:14.164 --> 00:07:15.444
neither do I.

00:07:16.404 --> 00:07:20.204
Why do you think I let you
steal that suit in the first place?

00:07:20.284 --> 00:07:21.444
What?

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:25.115
Second chances don't
come around all that much.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.195
So, next time you
think you might see one,

00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:32.755
I suggest you take
a real close look at it.

00:08:33.337 --> 00:08:36.297
<i>Smart choice.
You actually listened, for once.</i>

00:08:37.377 --> 00:08:38.337
<i>Under the door.</i>

00:08:43.817 --> 00:08:45.097
Okay, where to now?

00:08:45.177 --> 00:08:47.137
<i>- Hang tight.</i>
- Oh, God.

00:08:49.977 --> 00:08:51.017
What, what?

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:52.097
Where the hell did he go?

00:08:52.177 --> 00:08:53.417
I have no idea.
He just vanished.

00:08:53.497 --> 00:08:55.497
Set up a five-block perimeter.
Now!

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:56.777
Get back! Get back!

00:08:56.857 --> 00:08:59.457
<i>Scott, these are my associates.</i>

00:08:59.897 --> 00:09:01.377
Is that a camera on an ant?

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:03.337
Yeah, sure. Why not?

00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:04.377
Where's the car?

00:09:04.457 --> 00:09:06.137
<i>No car. We've got wings.</i>

00:09:06.217 --> 00:09:07.457
<i>Incoming!</i>

00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:20.457
<i>Put your foot on the central
node and mount the thorax.</i>

00:09:20.537 --> 00:09:22.457
How safe is...
<i>Just get on the damn ant, Scott!</i>

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:37.337
Why am I on a police car?

00:09:37.497 --> 00:09:39.177
Shouldn't I not
be on a police car?

00:09:39.257 --> 00:09:40.417
<i>So they can give you a lift</i>

00:09:40.537 --> 00:09:41.657
<i>past their five-block perimeter.</i>

00:09:41.737 --> 00:09:43.377
All right.

00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:45.417
Now, what's the next move?
<i>Hang on tight.</i>

00:09:45.497 --> 00:09:47.257
Oh, this is easy!
I'm getting the hang of this.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:48.937
Yank up to go up.
It's like a horse.

00:09:49.017 --> 00:09:51.097
<i>You're throwing 247 off balance.</i>

00:09:51.177 --> 00:09:52.577
Wait, his name is 247?

00:09:52.657 --> 00:09:54.417
<i>He doesn't have a name,
he has a number, Scott.</i>

00:09:54.497 --> 00:09:57.017
<i>Do you have any idea
how many ants there are?</i>

00:09:57.137 --> 00:09:58.857
Whoa!

00:09:58.937 --> 00:10:00.777
<i>Maybe it's... Maybe it's 248.</i>

00:10:00.857 --> 00:10:02.337
No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

00:10:02.417 --> 00:10:03.417
<i>No, I think it's 247.</i>

00:10:03.497 --> 00:10:04.537
Wait.

00:10:04.777 --> 00:10:06.337
<i>Hang on tight!</i>

00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:08.377
I think I'm getting
the hang of this.

00:10:08.457 --> 00:10:11.297
<i>I am controlling 247.
He is not listening to you.</i>

00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:12.377
What?

00:10:12.497 --> 00:10:14.377
Can I make one little request?
<i>No.</i>

00:10:15.897 --> 00:10:17.737
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

00:10:18.537 --> 00:10:19.737
Time out.

00:10:19.817 --> 00:10:20.897
All right, hold on.

00:10:20.977 --> 00:10:22.857
Just wait! Whoa!

00:10:23.417 --> 00:10:25.097
What happens if I
throw up in this helmet?

00:10:25.177 --> 00:10:28.497
<i>It's my helmet, Scott.
You do not throw up.</i>

00:10:28.577 --> 00:10:30.217
Let's set her down, all right?

00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:31.297
I'm getting light-headed.

00:10:31.377 --> 00:10:32.457
<i>Hang on, Scott.</i>

00:10:33.137 --> 00:10:35.097
I'm getting a little light...

00:10:35.177 --> 00:10:37.057
I need a snooze button.

00:10:37.577 --> 00:10:39.977
Hit me in 5 minutes.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.660
<i>The language of
the mystic arts...</i>

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.300
<i>is as old as civilization.</i>

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.900
The sorcerers of antiquity...

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.820
called the use of
this language "spells."

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.940
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities...

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.620
you can call it a "program."

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.780
The source code
that shapes reality.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.740
We harness energy...

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.340
drawn from other
dimensions of the Multiverse...

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.460
to cast spells...

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.700
to conjure shields...

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.740
and weapons...

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.900
to make magic.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.780
But even if my
fingers could do that...

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.540
my hands would just
be waving in the air.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.780
How do I get from here to there?

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.420
How did you get to
reattach severed nerves...

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.100
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.660
Study and practice, years of it.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.220
Hey.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.300
Mr. Strange.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.340
Uh, Stephen, please.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.580
- And you are?
- Wong.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.900
Wong.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.860
Just Wong?

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.700
Like Adele?

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.260
Or Aristotle.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.020
Drake.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.500
Bono.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.940
Eminem.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.220
<i>The Book of the Invisible Sun.</i>

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.620
<i>Astronomia Nova.</i>

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.340
<i>Codex Imperium.</i>

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.340
<i>Key of Solomon.</i>

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.940
You finished all of these?

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Yup.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.020
Come with me.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.220
All right.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.180
This section is
for masters only...

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.740
but at my discretion,
others may use it.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.300
You should start
with <i>Maxim's Primer.</i>

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.740
How's your Sanskrit?

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.780
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.700
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.700
What are those?

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.460
The Ancient One's
private collection.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.860
So, they're forbidden?

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.460
No knowledge in
Kamar-Taj is forbidden.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.460
Only certain practices.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.300
Those books are far too advanced

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.460
for anyone other than
the Sorcerer Supreme.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.540
This one's got pages missing.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.980
That's <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.820
A study of time.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.780
One of the rituals was
stolen by a former master.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.580
The Zealot, Kaecilius.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.620
Just after he strung
up the former librarian...

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.220
and relieved him of his head.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.780
I am now the guardian
of these books.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.580
So if a volume from this
collection should be stolen again...

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.020
I'd know it...

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.460
and you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.220
What if it's just overdue?

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.540
Any late fees I should know about?
Maiming, perhaps?

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.260
People used to
think that I was funny.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.620
Did they work for you?

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.900
All right.
Well, it's been lovely talking to you.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.820
Thank you for the books...

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.140
and for the horrifying story...

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.060
and for the threat upon my life.

00:15:05.731 --> 00:15:06.971
Hello.

00:15:10.411 --> 00:15:11.571
Who are you?

00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:16.371
Have you been standing there,
watching me sleep, this whole time?

00:15:16.451 --> 00:15:17.571
Yes.

00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:18.771
Why?

00:15:19.571 --> 00:15:21.651
Because the last time you
were here, you stole something.

00:15:22.891 --> 00:15:24.811
Oh. Oh.

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:26.611
Hey, look...

00:15:27.571 --> 00:15:28.571
Whoa!

00:15:33.211 --> 00:15:34.931
<i>Paraponera clavata.</i>

00:15:35.011 --> 00:15:36.491
Giant tropical bullet ants,

00:15:36.571 --> 00:15:38.131
ranked highest on
the Schmidt pain index.

00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:39.811
They're here to keep an
eye on you when I can't.

00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:43.931
Dr.
Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:45.571
Who?

00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:48.931
Hey!

00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:51.691
Um... Whose pajamas are these?

00:15:58.091 --> 00:16:00.011
How am I supposed to do this?

00:16:06.251 --> 00:16:09.291
All right, just one
step at a time.

00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:12.451
Ugh!

00:16:14.131 --> 00:16:18.651
You don't bite me, I don't step on you.
Deal?

00:16:22.411 --> 00:16:23.531
I could take down the servers

00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:24.731
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

00:16:24.811 --> 00:16:26.011
We don't need this guy.

00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:28.571
I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

00:16:28.651 --> 00:16:31.211
I did. She's great.

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:33.531
She doesn't think
that we need you.

00:16:33.611 --> 00:16:34.971
We don't.
We can do this ourselves.

00:16:35.051 --> 00:16:38.251
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.891
and then Hope has you arrested.

00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:44.011
Okay, we can try this and
when he fails, I'll do it myself.

00:16:44.131 --> 00:16:45.691
She's a little bit anxious.

00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:47.731
It has to do with this job,

00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:50.291
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

00:16:50.371 --> 00:16:52.651
I take it that
you're interested in.

00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:53.851
What job?

00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:55.051
Would you like some tea?

00:16:55.611 --> 00:16:57.331
Uh... Sure.

00:16:57.411 --> 00:16:59.011
I was very impressed with

00:16:59.091 --> 00:17:01.851
how you managed to get
past my security system.

00:17:03.131 --> 00:17:06.091
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

00:17:06.171 --> 00:17:07.611
Were you watching me?

00:17:07.691 --> 00:17:09.231
I saw myself,

00:17:09.552 --> 00:17:11.912
ever since you
robbed Vista Corp.

00:17:13.345 --> 00:17:15.265
Vista's security
system was one of

00:17:15.385 --> 00:17:17.305
the most advanced
in the business.

00:17:17.385 --> 00:17:19.105
It was supposed
to be unbeatable.

00:17:19.185 --> 00:17:21.105
But you beat it.

00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:22.465
Would you like some sugar?

00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:24.145
Yeah, thanks.

00:17:28.065 --> 00:17:29.265
You know what? I'm okay.

00:17:34.225 --> 00:17:36.425
How do you make them do that?

00:17:36.505 --> 00:17:39.145
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:42.825
They build, farm, they
cooperate with each other.

00:17:42.905 --> 00:17:45.065
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

00:17:47.065 --> 00:17:52.625
I use electromagnetic waves to
stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:55.745
I speak to them.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:58.145
I can go anywhere,
hear anything,

00:17:58.265 --> 00:17:59.665
and see everything.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.625
And still know
absolutely nothing.

00:18:02.265 --> 00:18:03.265
I'm late to meet Cross.

00:18:07.105 --> 00:18:08.865
Uh... Dr. Pym?

00:18:08.945 --> 00:18:11.265
You don't need to
raise your hand, Scott.

00:18:11.825 --> 00:18:14.505
Sorry, I just have one question.

00:18:14.585 --> 00:18:16.705
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

00:18:16.785 --> 00:18:18.425
and can I go back to jail now?

00:18:18.505 --> 00:18:19.905
Come with me.

00:18:20.545 --> 00:18:22.545
40 years ago, I
created a formula

00:18:22.665 --> 00:18:24.665
that altered atomic
relative distance.

00:18:24.745 --> 00:18:25.945
Huh?

00:18:26.025 --> 00:18:28.265
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

00:18:28.385 --> 00:18:30.025
That's what powers the suit.

00:18:30.105 --> 00:18:31.785
That's why it works.

00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:34.025
Wow.

00:18:39.425 --> 00:18:40.985
Whoa! But it was dangerous.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.785
It was too dangerous.

00:18:44.945 --> 00:18:46.945
So I hid it from the world.

00:18:47.785 --> 00:18:50.785
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

00:18:51.705 --> 00:18:52.785
Pym Tech.

00:18:52.905 --> 00:18:53.985
Yes.

00:18:54.985 --> 00:18:58.745
I took on a young protege
called Darren Cross.

00:18:58.825 --> 00:19:00.065
Darren Cross.

00:19:00.145 --> 00:19:01.225
He's a big deal.

00:19:01.305 --> 00:19:03.745
But before he was a big
deal, he was my assistant.

00:19:03.825 --> 00:19:08.185
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

00:19:08.265 --> 00:19:10.585
He was brilliant, but
as we became close,

00:19:10.665 --> 00:19:14.225
he began to suspect that I
wasn't telling him everything.

00:19:14.305 --> 00:19:17.985
He heard rumors about what
was called the Pym Particle,

00:19:18.065 --> 00:19:21.225
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:22.825
But I wouldn't help him.

00:19:22.905 --> 00:19:26.745
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

00:19:26.825 --> 00:19:28.345
How could he do that?

00:19:28.425 --> 00:19:31.225
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

00:19:31.305 --> 00:19:32.625
She was the deciding vote.

00:19:34.785 --> 00:19:36.225
But she came back to me

00:19:36.305 --> 00:19:39.665
when she saw how close Cross
was to cracking my formula.

00:19:40.705 --> 00:19:42.945
The process is highly volatile.

00:19:43.025 --> 00:19:45.905
If one isn't protected
by a specialized helmet,

00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.865
it can affect the
brain's chemistry.

00:19:49.505 --> 00:19:51.905
I don't think
Darren realizes this,

00:19:51.985 --> 00:19:54.825
and, you know, he's not the
most stable guy to begin with.

00:19:55.505 --> 00:19:57.665
So, what do you want from me?

00:19:59.705 --> 00:20:03.425
Scott, I believe that everyone
deserves a shot at redemption.

00:20:03.505 --> 00:20:04.465
Do you?

00:20:04.545 --> 00:20:06.065
I do.

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.145
If you can help me,

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:11.985
I promise I can help you
be with your daughter again.

00:20:13.025 --> 00:20:15.385
Now, are you ready
to redeem yourself?

00:20:15.985 --> 00:20:17.065
Absolutely.

00:20:17.145 --> 00:20:20.905
My days of breaking into
places and stealing shit are done.

00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:23.305
What do you want me to do?

00:20:23.385 --> 00:20:26.665
I want you to break into a
place and steal some shit.

00:20:29.656 --> 00:20:31.096
Are you gonna be
home for dinner tonight?

00:20:33.136 --> 00:20:35.376
Uh, yeah.
I'll pick something up. Text me.

00:20:35.456 --> 00:20:36.776
Okay. Good news?

00:20:37.096 --> 00:20:39.296
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

00:20:39.376 --> 00:20:41.896
Are you trying to find my daddy?

00:20:43.736 --> 00:20:45.496
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

00:20:46.776 --> 00:20:48.216
I just want your
daddy to be safe.

00:20:48.296 --> 00:20:50.456
Hope you don't catch him.

00:21:50.862 --> 00:21:54.662
Mastery of the sling ring is
essential to the mystic arts.

00:21:54.942 --> 00:21:57.342
They allow us to travel
throughout the Multiverse.

00:21:58.342 --> 00:21:59.862
All you need to do is focus.

00:22:00.662 --> 00:22:01.942
Visualize.

00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:05.342
See the destination
in your mind.

00:22:05.982 --> 00:22:08.502
Look beyond the
world in front of you.

00:22:09.502 --> 00:22:11.502
Imagine every detail.

00:22:12.822 --> 00:22:16.782
The clearer the picture,
the quicker and easier...

00:22:17.382 --> 00:22:19.222
the gateway will come.

00:22:22.822 --> 00:22:23.982
And stop.

00:22:24.062 --> 00:22:26.702
I would like a moment
alone with Mr. Strange.

00:22:27.422 --> 00:22:28.502
Of course.

00:22:32.662 --> 00:22:33.902
My hands.

00:22:33.982 --> 00:22:35.182
It's not about your hands.

00:22:35.422 --> 00:22:37.382
How is this not about my hands?

00:22:38.022 --> 00:22:39.062
Master Hamir.

00:22:53.062 --> 00:22:54.862
Thank you, Master Hamir.

00:22:56.262 --> 00:22:58.982
You cannot beat a
river into submission.

00:22:59.062 --> 00:23:01.022
You have to surrender
to its current...

00:23:01.182 --> 00:23:03.382
and use its power as your own.

00:23:03.582 --> 00:23:05.742
I control it by
surrendering control?

00:23:05.862 --> 00:23:07.222
That doesn't make any sense.

00:23:07.542 --> 00:23:09.822
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

00:23:10.582 --> 00:23:13.062
Your intellect has
taken you far in life...

00:23:13.262 --> 00:23:14.702
but it will take you no further.

00:23:15.222 --> 00:23:17.222
Surrender, Stephen.

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:19.422
Silence your ego...

00:23:19.702 --> 00:23:21.582
and your power will rise.

00:23:22.262 --> 00:23:23.582
Come with me.

00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:29.862
Wait.

00:23:29.942 --> 00:23:31.902
- Is this...
- Everest.

00:23:33.422 --> 00:23:34.502
Beautiful.

00:23:34.582 --> 00:23:37.142
Yeah, right, beautiful.

00:23:37.302 --> 00:23:39.742
Freezing but beautiful.

00:23:39.902 --> 00:23:40.982
At this temperature...

00:23:41.262 --> 00:23:43.382
a person can last
for 30 minutes...

00:23:43.462 --> 00:23:46.062
before suffering
permanent loss of function.

00:23:46.262 --> 00:23:47.262
Great.

00:23:47.382 --> 00:23:49.862
But you'll likely go into
shock within the first two.

00:23:51.142 --> 00:23:53.302
- What?
- Surrender, Stephen.

00:23:53.462 --> 00:23:54.462
No!

00:24:04.302 --> 00:24:05.302
How's our new recruit?

00:24:06.102 --> 00:24:07.622
We shall see.

00:24:08.422 --> 00:24:10.142
Any second now.

00:24:12.302 --> 00:24:13.502
Oh, no, not again.

00:24:18.862 --> 00:24:19.862
Maybe I should...

00:25:34.062 --> 00:25:35.062
Stephen.

00:25:35.342 --> 00:25:36.302
Wong.

00:25:36.382 --> 00:25:37.382
What do you want, Strange?

00:25:37.462 --> 00:25:38.902
Books on astral projection.

00:25:39.942 --> 00:25:40.982
You're not ready for that.

00:25:41.542 --> 00:25:43.382
Try me, Beyoncé.

00:25:46.182 --> 00:25:47.862
Oh, come on.
You've heard of her.

00:25:47.942 --> 00:25:49.302
She's a huge star, right?

00:25:52.062 --> 00:25:53.222
Do you ever laugh?

00:25:54.542 --> 00:25:56.142
Oh, come on, just
give me the book.

00:25:57.182 --> 00:25:58.262
No.

00:26:25.524 --> 00:26:27.164
<i>This isn't the first
time these guys</i>

00:26:27.244 --> 00:26:30.004
have tried to get their hands
on game-changing weaponry.

00:26:30.084 --> 00:26:34.164
That's Mitchell Carson, Ex-Head
of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:26:34.244 --> 00:26:36.604
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

00:26:37.164 --> 00:26:39.004
He always wanted my tech.

00:26:39.084 --> 00:26:42.444
And now, unless we break
in and steal the Yellowjacket

00:26:42.524 --> 00:26:44.604
and destroy all the data,

00:26:45.284 --> 00:26:50.684
Darren Cross is gonna
unleash chaos upon the world.

00:26:53.084 --> 00:26:57.164
I think our first move should
be calling the Avengers.

00:26:58.444 --> 00:27:00.204
I spent half my life

00:27:00.284 --> 00:27:03.484
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

00:27:03.564 --> 00:27:07.324
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

00:27:07.404 --> 00:27:10.764
This is not some cute
technology like the Iron Man suit.

00:27:10.844 --> 00:27:13.404
This could change
the texture of reality.

00:27:15.324 --> 00:27:17.284
Besides, they're
probably too busy

00:27:17.404 --> 00:27:19.404
dropping cities out of the sky.

00:27:20.004 --> 00:27:21.964
Okay, then why don't
you just send the ants?

00:27:22.644 --> 00:27:24.724
Scott, they are ants.

00:27:24.804 --> 00:27:28.764
Ants, they can do a lot of
things, but they still need a leader.

00:27:29.804 --> 00:27:32.204
Somebody that
could infiltrate a place

00:27:32.324 --> 00:27:34.684
that's designed to
prevent infiltration.

00:27:34.764 --> 00:27:36.484
Hank, I'm a thief, all right?
I mean,

00:27:36.644 --> 00:27:38.364
I'm a good thief,
but this is insane.

00:27:38.444 --> 00:27:40.524
He's right, Hank.
And you know it.

00:27:40.604 --> 00:27:43.164
You've seen the footage, you
know what Cross is capable of.

00:27:43.804 --> 00:27:45.324
I was against using him
when we had months,

00:27:45.404 --> 00:27:47.364
and now we have days.

00:27:47.444 --> 00:27:48.404
I'm wearing the suit.

00:27:48.484 --> 00:27:49.924
Absolutely not!

00:27:50.004 --> 00:27:52.924
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:54.524
I know this mission
better than anybody here.

00:27:54.644 --> 00:27:57.324
We need you close to Cross.
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

00:27:57.404 --> 00:27:58.604
We don't have time
to screw around!

00:27:58.724 --> 00:27:59.844
Hope, please listen to me...

00:27:59.924 --> 00:28:01.444
He is a criminal!
I'm your daughter.

00:28:01.524 --> 00:28:02.844
No!

00:28:41.244 --> 00:28:43.004
She's right, Hank.

00:28:43.084 --> 00:28:44.804
I'm not your guy.

00:28:45.404 --> 00:28:46.484
Why don't you wear the suit?

00:28:47.764 --> 00:28:49.964
You think I don't want to?

00:28:50.044 --> 00:28:51.284
I can't.

00:28:52.964 --> 00:28:54.764
I spent years wearing it,

00:28:55.404 --> 00:28:57.644
and it took a toll on me.

00:29:05.044 --> 00:29:06.364
You're our only option.

00:29:11.844 --> 00:29:14.684
Before Hope lost her mother,

00:29:14.764 --> 00:29:18.684
she used to look at me like I
was the greatest man in the world.

00:29:20.564 --> 00:29:23.804
And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

00:29:27.164 --> 00:29:29.124
It's too late for me,

00:29:30.404 --> 00:29:32.124
but not for you.

00:29:32.244 --> 00:29:34.124
This is your chance.

00:29:34.244 --> 00:29:37.844
The chance to earn that
look in your daughter's eyes.

00:29:37.924 --> 00:29:41.764
To become the hero that
she already thinks you are.

00:29:42.524 --> 00:29:45.004
It's not about saving our world.

00:29:45.924 --> 00:29:48.764
It's about saving theirs.

00:29:51.644 --> 00:29:53.484
Damn. That was a good speech.

00:29:54.124 --> 00:29:55.164
Scott,

00:29:56.244 --> 00:30:00.044
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

00:30:03.164 --> 00:30:04.484
In the right hands,

00:30:04.564 --> 00:30:07.844
the relationship between
man and suit is symbiotic.

00:30:07.924 --> 00:30:11.684
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

00:30:11.764 --> 00:30:14.564
You need to be skillful,
agile, and above all,

00:30:14.644 --> 00:30:15.884
you need to be fast.

00:30:15.964 --> 00:30:17.884
You should be able
to shrink and grow

00:30:17.964 --> 00:30:19.164
on a dime.

00:30:19.764 --> 00:30:23.044
So your size always
suits your needs.

00:30:24.124 --> 00:30:26.004
Now dive through
the keyhole, Scott.

00:30:26.084 --> 00:30:30.004
You charge big, you dive
small, then you emerge big.

00:30:31.924 --> 00:30:33.444
Ow!

00:30:34.684 --> 00:30:35.724
Ahhh!

00:30:36.164 --> 00:30:37.764
Ow!

00:30:37.964 --> 00:30:39.044
Useless.

00:30:41.364 --> 00:30:42.844
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:44.844
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

00:30:44.924 --> 00:30:48.204
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

00:30:48.284 --> 00:30:51.604
You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

00:30:51.684 --> 00:30:53.164
In other words, you have
to know how to punch.

00:30:53.244 --> 00:30:55.044
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

00:30:55.164 --> 00:30:56.844
Show me.

00:30:56.924 --> 00:30:58.444
Terrible.
You wanna show me how to punch?

00:30:59.284 --> 00:31:00.284
Show me...

00:31:01.684 --> 00:31:03.444
That's how you punch.

00:31:03.524 --> 00:31:04.844
She's been looking
forward to this.

00:31:05.004 --> 00:31:06.284
No kidding.

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:09.044
Hope trained in martial
arts at a difficult time.

00:31:09.124 --> 00:31:11.164
Oh, by "difficult time," he
means when my mother died.

00:31:11.244 --> 00:31:13.284
We lost her in a plane crash.

00:31:13.364 --> 00:31:15.124
It's bad enough you
won't tell me how she died.

00:31:15.204 --> 00:31:16.764
Could you please
stop telling me that lie?

00:31:16.844 --> 00:31:18.604
We're working, here.

00:31:21.804 --> 00:31:23.364
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

00:31:24.244 --> 00:31:26.524
Were you going for the hand?

00:31:32.844 --> 00:31:34.964
You know, I think this
regulator is holding me back.

00:31:35.044 --> 00:31:37.724
Do not screw with the regulator.

00:31:37.804 --> 00:31:39.564
If that regulator
is compromised,

00:31:39.644 --> 00:31:41.164
you would go subatomic.

00:31:41.244 --> 00:31:42.644
What does that mean?

00:31:43.724 --> 00:31:45.884
It means that you would
enter a quantum realm.

00:31:45.964 --> 00:31:47.404
What does that mean?

00:31:47.484 --> 00:31:49.684
It means that you
would enter a reality

00:31:49.804 --> 00:31:52.004
where all concepts
of time and space

00:31:52.084 --> 00:31:53.124
become irrelevant

00:31:53.204 --> 00:31:56.044
as you shrink for all eternity.

00:31:56.764 --> 00:31:59.324
Everything that you know

00:31:59.404 --> 00:32:00.764
and love,

00:32:01.644 --> 00:32:03.244
gone forever.

00:32:04.164 --> 00:32:07.484
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

00:32:07.564 --> 00:32:08.844
You've learned about the suit,

00:32:08.924 --> 00:32:11.684
but you've yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

00:32:13.004 --> 00:32:14.044
the ants.

00:32:14.604 --> 00:32:15.924
Loyal, brave,

00:32:16.004 --> 00:32:17.764
<i>and your partners on this job.</i>

00:32:23.844 --> 00:32:26.724
Paratrechina longicornis.
<i>Commonly known as crazy ants.</i>

00:32:26.804 --> 00:32:29.044
<i>They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,</i>

00:32:29.124 --> 00:32:31.524
<i>which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.</i>

00:32:31.604 --> 00:32:33.284
You're not so crazy.

00:32:34.724 --> 00:32:35.684
Hey!

00:32:35.804 --> 00:32:37.124
You're cute.

00:32:45.604 --> 00:32:47.724
That was a lot
scarier a second ago.

00:32:57.084 --> 00:33:00.724
It looks like the Futures Lab
has its own isolated power supply.

00:33:00.804 --> 00:33:02.724
<i>There's a security guard
posted around the clock.</i>

00:33:02.804 --> 00:33:05.404
We'll need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

00:33:05.484 --> 00:33:08.044
Okay, who's next?

00:33:10.124 --> 00:33:11.404
Paraponera clavata.

00:33:11.484 --> 00:33:13.164
<i>I know. Bullet ants, right?</i>

00:33:13.244 --> 00:33:14.844
Number 1 on the
Schmidt pain index?

00:33:14.924 --> 00:33:16.684
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the bedroom?

00:33:19.484 --> 00:33:21.404
<i>The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed,</i>

00:33:21.484 --> 00:33:22.804
and the only access
point is a tube

00:33:22.884 --> 00:33:25.684
we estimate to be about
5 millimeters in diameter.

00:33:25.764 --> 00:33:27.604
Why do I have a sick
feeling in my stomach?

00:33:27.684 --> 00:33:29.884
<i>The tube is protected
by a laser grid,</i>

00:33:29.964 --> 00:33:31.724
and we can only power
that down for 15 seconds.

00:33:31.804 --> 00:33:34.364
You're gonna need to signal
the crazy ants to blow the servers,

00:33:34.484 --> 00:33:36.484
retrieve the suit,
and exit the vaults

00:33:36.604 --> 00:33:38.564
before the backup
power comes on.

00:33:38.644 --> 00:33:40.804
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

00:33:41.524 --> 00:33:43.044
Alternatively known
as a carpenter ant.

00:33:43.164 --> 00:33:45.924
Ideal for ground
and air transport.

00:33:46.004 --> 00:33:47.684
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

00:33:49.004 --> 00:33:51.284
I'm gonna call him "Ant-thony."

00:33:51.364 --> 00:33:52.604
That's good. That's very good.

00:33:52.684 --> 00:33:54.964
Because this time,
you're really gonna

00:33:55.084 --> 00:33:57.284
have to learn
how to control him.

00:33:57.364 --> 00:34:00.124
<i>Tell them to put the
sugar in the teacup.</i>

00:34:03.044 --> 00:34:04.364
Aw! You okay? Did I hurt...

00:34:16.204 --> 00:34:18.284
Hank wants you outside
for target practice.

00:34:18.364 --> 00:34:20.044
<i>The suit has no weapons,
so I made you these discs.</i>

00:34:20.804 --> 00:34:22.044
<i>Red shrinks.</i>

00:34:23.044 --> 00:34:24.604
<i>Blue enlarges.</i>

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:29.164
Solenopsis mandibularis.

00:34:29.244 --> 00:34:30.524
<i>Known for their bite,</i>

00:34:30.604 --> 00:34:33.324
<i>the fire ants have evolved
into remarkable architects.</i>

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:36.524
<i>They are handy to get you
in and out of difficult places.</i>

00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:47.844
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

00:34:50.444 --> 00:34:52.524
They're not listening to me.

00:34:52.604 --> 00:34:55.284
You have to commit.
You have to mean it.

00:34:55.404 --> 00:34:57.284
No shortcuts, no lies.

00:34:57.444 --> 00:34:59.724
Throwing insults into the mix

00:34:59.844 --> 00:35:02.084
will not do anyone
any good, Hope.

00:35:02.164 --> 00:35:03.684
We don't have time for coddling.

00:35:03.764 --> 00:35:05.924
Our focus should
be on helping Scott!

00:35:06.004 --> 00:35:07.404
Really?

00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:10.124
Is that where our
focus should be?

00:35:34.444 --> 00:35:35.644
Hope!

00:35:44.444 --> 00:35:47.164
I don't know why I came
to you in the first place.

00:35:55.964 --> 00:35:58.284
We can't do this without her.

00:36:02.467 --> 00:36:03.547
Oh, God.

00:36:03.627 --> 00:36:05.587
You gotta lock your doors.

00:36:05.667 --> 00:36:08.547
I mean, really, there's some
weird folks in this neighborhood.

00:36:08.627 --> 00:36:10.307
Do you think this is a joke?

00:36:11.347 --> 00:36:13.867
Do you have any idea
what he's asking you to risk?

00:36:13.947 --> 00:36:15.147
You have a daughter.

00:36:15.227 --> 00:36:16.587
I'm doing this for her.

00:36:16.667 --> 00:36:19.627
You know, when my mother
died, I didn't see him for two weeks.

00:36:20.387 --> 00:36:21.347
He was in grief.

00:36:21.467 --> 00:36:22.787
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

00:36:22.867 --> 00:36:25.507
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

00:36:26.427 --> 00:36:28.227
He just sent me off
to boarding school.

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:30.587
You know, I thought,

00:36:31.427 --> 00:36:32.787
with all that's at stake,

00:36:32.867 --> 00:36:36.067
just maybe we might have
a chance of making peace.

00:36:36.147 --> 00:36:38.067
But, even now, he still
wants to shut me out.

00:36:38.147 --> 00:36:40.987
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

00:36:41.067 --> 00:36:42.467
Then why are you here?

00:36:42.547 --> 00:36:44.547
It proves that he loves you.

00:36:45.907 --> 00:36:48.227
Hope. Look at me.

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:51.147
I'm expendable.

00:36:51.747 --> 00:36:53.227
That's why I'm here.

00:36:54.387 --> 00:36:56.227
You must have
realized that by now.

00:36:57.067 --> 00:36:59.307
I mean, it's why I'm in
the suit and you're not.

00:37:01.187 --> 00:37:03.547
He would rather lose
this fight than lose you.

00:37:05.427 --> 00:37:06.507
Anyway...

00:37:07.827 --> 00:37:10.987
You know, I didn't
know you had a daughter

00:37:11.067 --> 00:37:13.267
when I called the cops on you.

00:37:17.307 --> 00:37:18.467
What's her name?

00:37:19.307 --> 00:37:20.827
Cassie.

00:37:21.587 --> 00:37:23.347
It's a pretty name.

00:37:26.787 --> 00:37:28.107
You have to clear
your mind, Scott.

00:37:28.267 --> 00:37:29.547
You have to make
your thoughts precise.

00:37:29.627 --> 00:37:31.587
That's how it works.

00:37:32.787 --> 00:37:34.187
Think about Cassie.

00:37:34.267 --> 00:37:38.147
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

00:37:46.907 --> 00:37:48.707
Open your eyes

00:37:48.787 --> 00:37:51.107
and just think about what
you want the ants to do.

00:38:13.987 --> 00:38:15.187
That's good!

00:38:19.648 --> 00:38:21.408
<i>Once, in this room,</i>

00:38:21.488 --> 00:38:23.808
<i>you begged me to let you learn.</i>

00:38:24.288 --> 00:38:26.848
Now, I'm told you
question every lesson...

00:38:26.928 --> 00:38:28.528
preferring to teach yourself.

00:38:28.808 --> 00:38:30.528
Once, in this room, you
told me to open my eye.

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:32.488
Now, I'm being told
to blindly accept rules...

00:38:32.728 --> 00:38:34.008
that make no sense.

00:38:34.328 --> 00:38:37.168
Like the rule against conjuring
a gateway in the library?

00:38:37.408 --> 00:38:38.768
Wong told on me?

00:38:39.008 --> 00:38:41.408
You're advancing quickly
with your sorcery skills.

00:38:41.488 --> 00:38:44.168
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

00:39:02.688 --> 00:39:04.688
You are now inside
the Mirror Dimension...

00:39:05.008 --> 00:39:07.528
ever present but undetected.

00:39:07.728 --> 00:39:09.728
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

00:39:11.688 --> 00:39:14.848
We use the Mirror
Dimension to train, surveil...

00:39:15.648 --> 00:39:17.968
and sometimes
to contain threats.

00:39:18.048 --> 00:39:20.128
You don't wanna be stuck
in here without your sling ring.

00:39:20.408 --> 00:39:23.088
Hold on. Sorry.
What do you mean, "threats?"

00:39:33.048 --> 00:39:36.888
Learning of an infinite Multiverse
includes learning of infinite dangers.

00:39:37.728 --> 00:39:40.128
If I told you everything else
that you don't already know...

00:39:40.208 --> 00:39:41.808
you'd run from here in terror.

00:39:47.848 --> 00:39:50.208
So just how ancient is she?

00:39:52.608 --> 00:39:54.968
No one knows the age
of the Sorcerer Supreme.

00:39:55.928 --> 00:39:58.888
Only that she's Celtic and
never talks about her past.

00:39:59.088 --> 00:40:00.928
You follow her, even
though you don't know?

00:40:01.008 --> 00:40:02.048
I know she's steadfast...

00:40:02.288 --> 00:40:03.688
but unpredictable.

00:40:03.848 --> 00:40:05.168
Merciless, yet kind.

00:40:07.328 --> 00:40:08.768
She made me what I am.

00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:11.728
Trust your teacher...

00:40:12.608 --> 00:40:13.648
and don't lose your way.

00:40:13.928 --> 00:40:14.968
Like Kaecilius?

00:40:15.368 --> 00:40:16.368
That's right.

00:40:21.088 --> 00:40:22.328
You knew him.

00:40:23.568 --> 00:40:24.608
When he first came to us...

00:40:25.368 --> 00:40:26.968
he'd lost everyone
he ever loved.

00:40:27.248 --> 00:40:30.968
He was a grieving, broken man
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

00:40:31.048 --> 00:40:34.968
A brilliant student, but
he was proud, headstrong.

00:40:35.048 --> 00:40:37.008
He questioned the Ancient
One, rejected her teaching.

00:40:44.728 --> 00:40:46.528
He left Kamar-Taj.

00:40:46.608 --> 00:40:49.208
His disciples followed
him like sheep.

00:40:49.288 --> 00:40:51.248
Seduced by false doctrine.

00:40:51.328 --> 00:40:53.688
And he stole the
forbidden ritual, right?

00:40:53.768 --> 00:40:54.768
Yes.

00:40:55.008 --> 00:40:56.128
What did it do?

00:40:58.488 --> 00:40:59.848
No more questions.

00:41:01.328 --> 00:41:02.408
What's that?

00:41:02.488 --> 00:41:03.728
That's a question.

00:41:05.488 --> 00:41:07.288
This is a relic.

00:41:07.448 --> 00:41:09.288
Some magic is too
powerful to sustain...

00:41:09.448 --> 00:41:10.448
so we imbue objects with it...

00:41:11.768 --> 00:41:13.968
allowing them to take
the strain we cannot.

00:41:14.168 --> 00:41:17.008
This is the staff...

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:18.808
of the Living Tribunal.

00:41:22.608 --> 00:41:23.728
There are many relics.

00:41:24.488 --> 00:41:25.648
The Wand of Watoomb.

00:41:25.968 --> 00:41:28.328
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

00:41:28.568 --> 00:41:30.328
Really just roll off
the tongue, don't they?

00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:33.008
- When do I get my relic?
- When you're ready.

00:41:33.488 --> 00:41:34.528
I think I'm ready.

00:41:34.768 --> 00:41:37.328
You're ready when the
relic decides you're ready.

00:41:38.048 --> 00:41:39.288
For now...

00:41:40.288 --> 00:41:41.288
conjure a weapon.

00:41:43.048 --> 00:41:44.048
All right.

00:41:50.448 --> 00:41:51.568
Fight!

00:41:52.688 --> 00:41:54.168
Fight like your
life depended on it.

00:42:00.368 --> 00:42:01.768
Because one day...

00:42:02.048 --> 00:42:03.248
it may.

00:42:24.812 --> 00:42:26.652
We will now receive the power

00:42:26.772 --> 00:42:28.652
to destroy the one
who betrayed us.

00:42:31.092 --> 00:42:33.252
The one who betrays the world.

00:43:38.425 --> 00:43:40.665
How could I think Tivan could
contain whatever was within the Orb?

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:43.025
What do you still have it for?

00:43:43.105 --> 00:43:44.345
What are we gonna
do, leave it in there?

00:43:44.425 --> 00:43:46.345
I can't believe you
had that in your purse!

00:43:47.145 --> 00:43:48.265
It's not a purse,
it's a knapsack!

00:43:48.385 --> 00:43:50.185
We have to bring
this to the Nova Corps.

00:43:50.665 --> 00:43:52.145
There's a chance
they can contain it.

00:43:52.225 --> 00:43:53.225
Are you kidding me?

00:43:53.345 --> 00:43:56.225
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.
Just give it to Ronan!

00:43:56.385 --> 00:43:57.545
So he can destroy the galaxy?

00:43:57.705 --> 00:43:59.505
What are you, some
saint all of a sudden?

00:43:59.585 --> 00:44:02.625
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

00:44:02.705 --> 00:44:04.505
Because I'm one of
the idiots who lives in it!

00:44:04.585 --> 00:44:06.105
Peter, listen to me.

00:44:06.225 --> 00:44:09.385
We cannot allow the Stone
to fall into Ronan's hands.

00:44:09.505 --> 00:44:11.185
We have to go back to your ship,

00:44:11.305 --> 00:44:12.705
and deliver it to Nova.

00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:15.345
Right, right, okay.
I think you're right.

00:44:16.185 --> 00:44:20.105
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

00:44:20.225 --> 00:44:21.425
who's really nice

00:44:21.545 --> 00:44:23.305
for a whole lot of money.

00:44:23.425 --> 00:44:26.065
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

00:44:26.185 --> 00:44:27.185
You're despicable.

00:44:27.745 --> 00:44:28.745
Dishonorable.

00:44:29.425 --> 00:44:30.425
Faithless!

00:44:31.225 --> 00:44:32.665
- Oh, no.
- At last!

00:44:35.265 --> 00:44:37.705
I shall meet my
foe and destroy him.

00:44:38.025 --> 00:44:39.585
You called Ronan?

00:44:44.465 --> 00:44:47.505
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

00:44:48.625 --> 00:44:50.745
Don't you move!
Get out of the way!

00:44:54.665 --> 00:44:57.185
Ronan the Accuser!

00:44:57.265 --> 00:44:59.665
You are the one who
transmitted the message?

00:44:59.745 --> 00:45:01.225
You killed my wife.

00:45:02.185 --> 00:45:04.025
You killed my daughter!

00:45:11.425 --> 00:45:15.265
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

00:45:20.785 --> 00:45:24.225
It is Gamora.
She is escaping with the Orb.

00:45:33.105 --> 00:45:34.585
No!

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:35.665
Nebula,

00:45:36.545 --> 00:45:38.265
retrieve the Orb.

00:45:54.665 --> 00:45:56.625
The Stone is in
the furthest pod.

00:45:57.345 --> 00:45:58.585
Bring it down!

00:46:15.505 --> 00:46:16.625
Ah!

00:46:27.265 --> 00:46:30.345
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the <i>Milano.</i>

00:46:30.505 --> 00:46:32.825
How?
We've got no weaponry on these things.

00:46:33.145 --> 00:46:34.745
These pods are industrial grade.

00:46:34.865 --> 00:46:36.185
<i>They're nearly indestructible.</i>

00:46:36.305 --> 00:46:38.465
Not against
necroblasts, they're not.

00:46:38.865 --> 00:46:40.545
That's not what I'm saying.

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:42.825
Oh!

00:47:29.145 --> 00:47:30.705
Let me borrow your ride.

00:48:03.545 --> 00:48:05.425
I don't recall
killing your family.

00:48:08.625 --> 00:48:11.945
I doubt I'll remember
killing you, either.

00:48:28.625 --> 00:48:31.505
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the <i>Milano.</i>

00:48:32.225 --> 00:48:33.225
I have to head out.

00:48:35.625 --> 00:48:37.585
Wait!
These things aren't meant to go out there.

00:48:44.665 --> 00:48:46.545
You are a
disappointment, sister.

00:48:47.345 --> 00:48:49.305
Of all our siblings,

00:48:49.985 --> 00:48:51.585
I hated you least.

00:48:51.985 --> 00:48:53.345
<i>Nebula, please.</i>

00:48:53.505 --> 00:48:54.985
If Ronan gets this stone

00:48:55.505 --> 00:48:57.345
<i>- he'll kill us all.</i>
- Not all.

00:48:58.865 --> 00:49:00.625
You will already be dead.

00:49:55.065 --> 00:49:58.065
<i>Ronan, it is done.</i>

00:50:01.065 --> 00:50:02.305
<i>Quill, come on.</i>

00:50:02.785 --> 00:50:05.345
<i>Her body mods should keep
her alive a couple more minutes,</i>

00:50:05.465 --> 00:50:07.505
<i>but there's nothing
we can do for her.</i>

00:50:07.625 --> 00:50:09.025
<i>These pods aren't
meant to be out here.</i>

00:50:09.345 --> 00:50:11.665
<i>In a second, we're
gonna be in the same boat.</i>

00:50:19.065 --> 00:50:21.545
Aw, damn it.

00:50:22.785 --> 00:50:24.345
<i>Quill?</i>

00:50:24.465 --> 00:50:26.065
Yondu! Yondu.

00:50:26.585 --> 00:50:27.585
<i>This is Quill!</i>

00:50:27.665 --> 00:50:31.105
<i>- My coordinates are 227K324.</i>
<i>- Quill.</i>

00:50:31.505 --> 00:50:32.625
Quill, what are you doing?

00:50:32.745 --> 00:50:34.105
Just outside Knowhere.

00:50:34.425 --> 00:50:36.545
If you're there, come get me.

00:50:37.105 --> 00:50:38.705
I'm all yours.

00:50:48.105 --> 00:50:50.065
<i>Quill, don't be ridiculous.</i>

00:50:51.745 --> 00:50:53.825
<i>Get back into your pod!</i>

00:50:54.105 --> 00:50:57.425
<i>You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.</i>

00:50:58.585 --> 00:51:00.465
You'll die in seconds!

00:51:00.705 --> 00:51:01.825
Quill.

00:52:02.905 --> 00:52:04.625
Quill?

00:52:06.185 --> 00:52:07.745
What happened?

00:52:08.865 --> 00:52:10.905
I saw you out there.

00:52:12.425 --> 00:52:14.825
I don't know what came over me.

00:52:15.785 --> 00:52:17.665
But I couldn't let you die.

00:52:20.545 --> 00:52:22.865
I found something
inside of myself.

00:52:23.865 --> 00:52:25.545
Something

00:52:25.665 --> 00:52:27.625
incredibly heroic.

00:52:29.225 --> 00:52:31.865
I mean, not to brag,

00:52:31.985 --> 00:52:33.225
but, objectively...

00:52:33.505 --> 00:52:34.545
Where's the Orb?

00:52:36.225 --> 00:52:38.585
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

00:52:38.705 --> 00:52:39.745
What?

00:52:42.545 --> 00:52:44.905
Welcome home, Peter.

00:52:57.322 --> 00:53:00.202
Your mother convinced me

00:53:00.282 --> 00:53:03.362
to let her join me
on my missions.

00:53:03.882 --> 00:53:06.042
They called her the Wasp.

00:53:06.122 --> 00:53:08.362
She was born to it.

00:53:10.002 --> 00:53:11.922
And there's not
a day that goes by

00:53:12.842 --> 00:53:15.842
that I don't regret
having said yes.

00:53:20.282 --> 00:53:22.002
It was 1987.

00:53:22.762 --> 00:53:27.242
Separatists had hijacked a
Soviet missile silo in Kursk

00:53:28.802 --> 00:53:31.762
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

00:53:39.202 --> 00:53:42.362
<i>The only way to the
internal mechanics</i>

00:53:42.442 --> 00:53:44.402
<i>was through solid titanium.</i>

00:53:53.682 --> 00:53:58.362
<i>I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.</i>

00:53:58.442 --> 00:54:01.722
<i>But my regulator had
sustained too much damage.</i>

00:54:03.442 --> 00:54:04.882
<i>Your mother,</i>

00:54:04.962 --> 00:54:06.282
<i>she didn't hesitate.</i>

00:54:08.442 --> 00:54:10.082
Janet! No!

00:54:16.802 --> 00:54:19.282
She turned off her regulator

00:54:20.082 --> 00:54:21.802
and went subatomic

00:54:23.282 --> 00:54:25.322
to deactivate the bomb.

00:54:27.202 --> 00:54:28.962
And she was gone.

00:54:33.442 --> 00:54:35.522
Your mom died a hero.

00:54:38.242 --> 00:54:40.562
And I spent the next 10 years

00:54:40.642 --> 00:54:45.002
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

00:54:48.522 --> 00:54:50.642
You were trying
to bring her back.

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:55.922
But all I learned
was we know nothing.

00:55:00.882 --> 00:55:02.722
It's not your fault.

00:55:04.922 --> 00:55:06.562
She made her choice.

00:55:12.042 --> 00:55:15.762
But why didn't you
tell me that sooner?

00:55:15.842 --> 00:55:18.802
I was trying to protect you.

00:55:20.642 --> 00:55:22.242
I lost your mother.

00:55:24.482 --> 00:55:27.162
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

00:55:28.002 --> 00:55:29.362
I'm sorry.

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:34.002
This is awesome.

00:55:35.042 --> 00:55:36.762
It's awesome, you know?

00:55:36.842 --> 00:55:38.882
You guys are breaking
down walls, you're healing.

00:55:40.002 --> 00:55:41.402
It's important.

00:55:44.362 --> 00:55:45.802
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

00:55:45.882 --> 00:55:47.602
Yes, you did. Yes.

00:55:48.762 --> 00:55:50.722
I'm going to make some tea.

00:56:15.113 --> 00:56:17.913
Blasted idiot.
They're all idiots!

00:56:19.193 --> 00:56:21.393
Quill just got himself captured.

00:56:21.553 --> 00:56:25.953
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

00:56:26.073 --> 00:56:27.273
take on a frickin' army!

00:56:29.113 --> 00:56:30.273
You're right.

00:56:33.033 --> 00:56:35.113
I was a fool.

00:56:37.473 --> 00:56:39.233
All the anger,

00:56:39.993 --> 00:56:41.833
all the rage,

00:56:44.993 --> 00:56:47.233
was just to cover my loss.

00:56:53.873 --> 00:56:58.153
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.
"My wife and child are dead."

00:56:59.593 --> 00:57:01.953
Oh, I don't care if it's mean!

00:57:02.073 --> 00:57:03.993
Everybody's got dead people.

00:57:04.553 --> 00:57:06.233
It's no excuse to
get everybody else

00:57:06.433 --> 00:57:08.313
dead along the way!

00:57:12.193 --> 00:57:14.913
Come on, Groot.
Ronan has the Stone.

00:57:15.033 --> 00:57:18.233
The only chance we got is to
get to the other side of the universe

00:57:18.313 --> 00:57:20.233
as fast as we can and maybe,

00:57:20.353 --> 00:57:25.073
just maybe, we'll be able to live full
lives before that whack-job ever gets there.

00:57:27.433 --> 00:57:28.953
I am Groot.

00:57:29.073 --> 00:57:31.273
Save them? How?

00:57:31.433 --> 00:57:34.233
I am Groot.

00:57:34.353 --> 00:57:37.073
I know they're the only
friends that we ever had,

00:57:37.153 --> 00:57:39.953
but there's an army of
Ravagers around them.

00:57:40.073 --> 00:57:41.593
And there's only two of us!

00:57:42.633 --> 00:57:43.993
Three.

00:57:50.473 --> 00:57:51.913
Aw!

00:57:53.113 --> 00:57:55.273
You're making me

00:57:55.393 --> 00:57:57.033
beat...up

00:57:57.193 --> 00:57:58.193
grass!

00:58:00.633 --> 00:58:02.393
The Orb is in my possession,

00:58:03.473 --> 00:58:05.113
as I promised.

00:58:05.233 --> 00:58:06.633
<i>Bring it to me.</i>

00:58:06.993 --> 00:58:10.233
Yes, that was our agreement.

00:58:11.033 --> 00:58:12.553
Bring you the Orb,

00:58:12.913 --> 00:58:16.313
and you will destroy
Xandar for me.

00:58:16.473 --> 00:58:21.113
However, now that I know
it contains an Infinity Stone,

00:58:21.233 --> 00:58:23.233
I wonder what
use I have for you.

00:58:23.353 --> 00:58:24.993
<i>Boy,</i>

00:58:25.233 --> 00:58:27.593
<i>I would reconsider
your current course.</i>

00:58:28.913 --> 00:58:31.113
Master! You cannot!

00:58:31.273 --> 00:58:33.673
Thanos is the most
powerful being in the universe.

00:58:34.353 --> 00:58:36.073
Not anymore.

00:58:58.953 --> 00:59:01.153
You call me "boy!"

00:59:01.273 --> 00:59:05.713
I will unfurl 1,000 years
of Kree justice on Xandar,

00:59:06.033 --> 00:59:09.473
and burn it to its core!

00:59:09.593 --> 00:59:11.553
Then, Thanos,

00:59:11.713 --> 00:59:13.673
I am coming for you.

00:59:16.193 --> 00:59:19.113
After Xandar, you are
going to kill my father?

00:59:19.473 --> 00:59:21.353
You dare to oppose me?

00:59:21.473 --> 00:59:23.313
You see what he
has turned me into.

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:27.593
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.120
What do you let it
lick you like that for?

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.040
Gross.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.640
