00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:43.724
So, you like cats?

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:45.724
- Sam.
- What?

00:00:45.884 --> 00:00:47.004
Dude shows up
dressed like a cat,

00:00:47.084 --> 00:00:48.364
you don't wanna know more?

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:52.404
Your suit... it's vibranium?

00:00:55.924 --> 00:00:58.124
The Black Panther
has been the protector

00:00:58.244 --> 00:01:00.204
of Wakanda for generations.

00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:04.404
A mantle, passed
from warrior to warrior.

00:01:06.204 --> 00:01:08.964
And now, because your
friend murdered my father...

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:12.444
I also wear the mantle of king.

00:01:13.124 --> 00:01:14.604
So, I ask you...

00:01:14.684 --> 00:01:17.724
as both warrior and king...

00:01:18.924 --> 00:01:22.644
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?

00:01:42.444 --> 00:01:43.764
What's gonna happen to him?

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:46.124
Same thing that
ought to happen to you.

00:01:46.244 --> 00:01:48.444
Psychological
evaluation and extradition.

00:01:48.604 --> 00:01:50.444
This is Everett Ross, Deputy
Task Force Commander.

00:01:51.124 --> 00:01:52.164
What about a lawyer?

00:01:52.324 --> 00:01:54.004
Lawyer. That's funny.

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:56.124
See their weapons
are placed in lockup.

00:01:56.284 --> 00:01:58.164
We'll write you a receipt.

00:01:58.324 --> 00:01:59.884
I better not look out the window

00:01:59.964 --> 00:02:02.004
and see anybody
flying around in that.

00:02:36.084 --> 00:02:38.084
"A pinch of paprika."

00:02:38.244 --> 00:02:39.244
A pinch.

00:02:43.084 --> 00:02:44.964
Is that paprikash?

00:02:45.124 --> 00:02:48.404
I thought it might
lift your spirits.

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:03.644
Spirits lifted.

00:03:05.244 --> 00:03:07.124
In my defense,

00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:10.164
I haven't actually ever
eaten anything before, so...

00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:11.524
May I?

00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:12.684
Please.

00:03:19.764 --> 00:03:21.044
Wanda? Hmm.

00:03:21.364 --> 00:03:23.124
No one dislikes you, Wanda.

00:03:25.524 --> 00:03:26.524
Thanks.

00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:27.644
Oh, you're welcome.

00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:31.124
No, it's a involuntary
response in their amygdala.

00:03:31.204 --> 00:03:33.284
They can't help
but be afraid of you.

00:03:33.444 --> 00:03:34.444
Are you?

00:03:34.524 --> 00:03:36.524
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:42.604
I used to think of
myself one way.

00:03:44.884 --> 00:03:46.804
But after this...

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:49.364
I am something else.

00:03:49.524 --> 00:03:53.324
I'm still me, I think, but...

00:03:55.324 --> 00:03:57.964
that's not what
everyone else sees.

00:04:00.964 --> 00:04:02.724
Do you know, I don't
know what this is?

00:04:04.204 --> 00:04:05.324
Not really.

00:04:05.684 --> 00:04:07.404
I know it's not of this world...

00:04:07.484 --> 00:04:08.924
that it powered Loki's staff,

00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:11.244
gave you your abilities, but...

00:04:12.644 --> 00:04:16.004
its true nature is a mystery.

00:04:16.164 --> 00:04:18.244
And yet, it is part of me.

00:04:18.404 --> 00:04:19.524
Are you afraid of it?

00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:22.564
I wish to understand it.

00:04:22.724 --> 00:04:24.884
The more I do, the
less it controls me.

00:04:25.044 --> 00:04:28.004
One day... who knows?

00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:29.604
I may even control it.

00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:36.164
I don't know what's in
this but it is not paprika.

00:04:36.924 --> 00:04:39.044
I'm gonna go to the store.

00:04:39.564 --> 00:04:41.684
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

00:04:41.844 --> 00:04:44.604
Alternatively, we
could order a pizza?

00:04:46.084 --> 00:04:49.044
Vision, are you not
letting me leave?

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:52.444
It is a question of safety.

00:04:52.684 --> 00:04:54.564
I can protect myself.

00:04:55.964 --> 00:04:57.364
Not yours.

00:04:59.044 --> 00:05:01.644
Mr. Stark would like
to avoid the possibility

00:05:01.724 --> 00:05:03.524
of another public incident.

00:05:04.044 --> 00:05:08.124
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.

00:05:10.604 --> 00:05:12.644
And what do you want?

00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:15.204
For people to see you...

00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:17.604
as I do.

00:05:20.527 --> 00:05:22.047
You'll be provided
with an office

00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:23.527
instead of a cell.

00:05:23.607 --> 00:05:25.727
Now, do me a favor, stay in it?

00:05:26.407 --> 00:05:28.407
I don't intend on
going anywhere.

00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:30.407
For the record, this is what

00:05:30.487 --> 00:05:32.407
making things worse looks like.

00:05:32.567 --> 00:05:33.727
He's alive.

00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:35.407
No.

00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:37.767
Romania was not
Accords-sanctioned.

00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:39.567
Colonel Rhodes is
supervising cleanup.

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:41.687
Try not to break
anything while we fix this.

00:05:41.887 --> 00:05:44.247
Consequences?
You bet there'll be consequences.

00:05:44.407 --> 00:05:46.007
Obviously you can
quote me on that,

00:05:46.087 --> 00:05:47.647
because I just said it.
Anything else?

00:05:47.807 --> 00:05:48.887
Thank you, sir.

00:05:50.087 --> 00:05:51.367
"Consequences"?

00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:52.767
Secretary Ross wants
you both prosecuted.

00:05:52.887 --> 00:05:54.127
Had to give him something.

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.767
I'm not getting that
shield back, am I?

00:05:56.247 --> 00:05:57.487
Technically, it's the
government's property.

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:58.807
Wings, too.

00:05:59.087 --> 00:06:00.127
That's cold.

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:01.607
Warmer than jail.

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:14.209
Hey, you wanna
see something cool?

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:17.129
I pulled something
from Dad's archives.

00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:19.969
Felt timely.

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:27.809
FDR signed the Lend-Lease
bill with these in 1941.

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.169
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:33.489
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.569
See?
If not for these, you wouldn't be here.

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:41.769
I'm trying to...
What do you call it?

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:43.849
That's an olive branch.

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:46.169
Is that what you call it?

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:50.089
Is Pepper here?
I didn't see her.

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:53.649
We're kinda...

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:55.969
- Well, not kinda...
- Pregnant?

00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:57.809
No. Definitely not.

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:59.809
We're taking a break.

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:01.369
It's nobody's fault.

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:04.449
I'm so sorry, Tony.
I didn't know.

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:06.609
A few years ago,
I almost lost her,

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:08.169
so I trashed all my suits.

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:10.969
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:13.489
and then Ultron. My fault.

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:16.809
And then, and then,
and then, I never stopped.

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:19.489
Because the truth
is I don't wanna stop.

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:22.849
I don't wanna lose her.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.809
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:31.369
In her defense, I'm a handful.

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:35.049
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:36.969
but he and Mom
always made it work.

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:38.569
I'm glad Howard got married.

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:41.209
I only knew him when
he was young and single.

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:43.329
Oh, really?
You two knew each other?

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:44.809
He never mentioned that.

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:47.569
Maybe only a thousand times.

00:07:48.369 --> 00:07:49.729
God, I hated you.

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:53.209
I don't mean to
make things difficult.

00:07:53.369 --> 00:07:55.689
I know, because you're
a very polite person.

00:07:56.329 --> 00:07:58.569
If I see a situation
pointed south...

00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:01.009
I can't ignore it.

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:02.529
Sometimes I wish I could.

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:03.769
No, you don't.

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:08.209
No, I don't.

00:08:08.929 --> 00:08:09.929
Sometimes...

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:13.169
Sometimes I wanna punch
you in your perfect teeth.

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:15.329
But I don't wanna see you gone.

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.729
We need you, Cap.

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:19.209
So far, nothing's happened

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:21.209
that can't be
undone, if you sign.

00:08:22.049 --> 00:08:23.889
We can make the
last 24 hours legit.

00:08:24.049 --> 00:08:26.369
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-center...

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:28.409
instead of a Wakandan prison.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:41.769
I'm not saying
it's impossible...

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.889
but there would have
to be safeguards.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:45.089
Sure.

00:08:45.249 --> 00:08:46.889
Once we put out the PR fire,

00:08:46.969 --> 00:08:48.969
those documents can be amended.

00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:51.049
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...

00:08:51.209 --> 00:08:53.049
Wanda? What about Wanda?

00:08:53.209 --> 00:08:54.769
She's fine.
She's confined to the compound, currently.

00:08:54.929 --> 00:08:56.089
Vision's keeping her company.

00:08:56.249 --> 00:08:57.449
Oh, God, Tony.

00:08:57.609 --> 00:08:59.769
Every time I think you
see things the right way...

00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:00.969
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.

00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:02.049
It's got a screening room.

00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:03.289
There's worse ways
to protect people.

00:09:03.449 --> 00:09:04.449
Protection?

00:09:05.129 --> 00:09:06.249
Is that how you see this?

00:09:06.329 --> 00:09:08.409
This is protection?
It's internment, Tony.

00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:09.849
She's not a US citizen.
Oh, come on, Tony.

00:09:09.929 --> 00:09:11.489
And they don't grant visas to
weapons of mass destruction.

00:09:11.569 --> 00:09:12.529
She's a kid!

00:09:12.609 --> 00:09:14.169
Give me a break!

00:09:15.249 --> 00:09:17.289
I'm doing what has to be done.

00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:19.249
To stave off something worse.

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:24.289
You keep telling yourself that.

00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:28.769
Hate to break up the set.

00:10:40.994 --> 00:10:41.994
Wong?

00:10:54.674 --> 00:10:55.674
Okay.

00:10:56.314 --> 00:10:59.874
"First, open the
Eye of Agamotto."

00:11:20.074 --> 00:11:21.274
All right.

00:11:44.594 --> 00:11:45.914
Oh, my.

00:12:00.474 --> 00:12:01.554
What if...

00:12:23.474 --> 00:12:24.834
"Dormammu."

00:12:26.594 --> 00:12:27.714
"The Dark Dimension."

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.154
Eternal life?

00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:37.474
- What the...
- Stop!

00:12:41.634 --> 00:12:43.954
Tampering with continuum
probabilities is forbidden.

00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:46.554
I was just doing exactly
what it said in the book.

00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:47.994
What did the book say

00:12:48.074 --> 00:12:49.394
about the dangers of
performing that ritual?

00:12:49.634 --> 00:12:51.234
I don't know.
I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

00:12:51.314 --> 00:12:54.314
Temporal manipulations
can create branches in time.

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:56.754
Unstable dimensional openings.

00:12:56.914 --> 00:12:59.114
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!

00:12:59.274 --> 00:13:01.234
You wanna get stuck
reliving the same moment

00:13:01.554 --> 00:13:02.634
over and over forever...

00:13:02.714 --> 00:13:04.034
or never having existed at all?

00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:07.714
Really should put the
warnings before the spell.

00:13:07.794 --> 00:13:09.754
Your curiosity could
have gotten you killed.

00:13:10.034 --> 00:13:12.154
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum...

00:13:12.274 --> 00:13:13.234
you were breaking it.

00:13:14.674 --> 00:13:16.634
We do not tamper
with natural law.

00:13:16.714 --> 00:13:17.714
We defend it.

00:13:17.954 --> 00:13:19.274
How did you even do that?

00:13:19.594 --> 00:13:20.634
Hmm?

00:13:20.914 --> 00:13:23.794
Where did you learn the litany of
spells required to even understand it?

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:25.074
I've got a photographic memory.

00:13:25.154 --> 00:13:26.914
That's how I got my M.D.
and Ph.D. at the same time.

00:13:27.234 --> 00:13:28.594
What you just did...

00:13:29.394 --> 00:13:31.074
takes more than a good memory.

00:13:31.354 --> 00:13:33.074
You were born
for the mystic arts.

00:13:33.154 --> 00:13:35.314
And yet my hands still shake.

00:13:35.554 --> 00:13:36.674
For now, yes.

00:13:36.794 --> 00:13:37.954
Not forever?

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.274
We're not prophets.

00:13:39.434 --> 00:13:41.154
When are you gonna start
telling me what we are?

00:13:46.594 --> 00:13:48.234
While heroes like the Avengers

00:13:48.314 --> 00:13:50.634
protect the world from
physical dangers...

00:13:50.714 --> 00:13:54.154
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:57.714
The Ancient One is
the latest in a long line

00:13:57.794 --> 00:13:58.954
of Sorcerers Supreme...

00:13:59.474 --> 00:14:02.794
going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts...

00:14:02.954 --> 00:14:04.154
the mighty Agamotto.

00:14:05.194 --> 00:14:09.274
Same sorcerer who created the
eye you so recklessly borrowed.

00:14:10.754 --> 00:14:14.274
Agamotto built three
Sanctums in places of power...

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.434
where great cities now stand.

00:14:16.514 --> 00:14:18.674
That door leads to the
Hong Kong Sanctum.

00:14:19.434 --> 00:14:21.314
That door to the
New York Sanctum.

00:14:22.034 --> 00:14:23.234
That one to the London Sanctum.

00:14:24.154 --> 00:14:25.394
Together...

00:14:25.674 --> 00:14:29.114
the Sanctums generate a
protective shield around our world.

00:14:29.554 --> 00:14:31.274
The Sanctums
protect the world...

00:14:31.394 --> 00:14:32.674
and we sorcerers...

00:14:33.394 --> 00:14:34.634
protect the Sanctums.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.754
From what?

00:14:36.994 --> 00:14:39.554
Other dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

00:14:40.274 --> 00:14:41.354
Like Dormammu.

00:14:42.954 --> 00:14:44.274
Where did you learn that name?

00:14:44.954 --> 00:14:48.154
I just read it in <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>
Why?

00:14:53.354 --> 00:14:55.914
Dormammu dwells
in the Dark Dimension.

00:14:57.074 --> 00:14:58.074
Beyond time.

00:14:58.874 --> 00:15:00.874
He is the cosmic conqueror...

00:15:00.994 --> 00:15:02.914
the destroyer of worlds.

00:15:03.354 --> 00:15:06.754
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger...

00:15:06.834 --> 00:15:09.234
on a quest to invade
every universe...

00:15:09.314 --> 00:15:12.034
and bring all worlds
into his Dark Dimension.

00:15:13.474 --> 00:15:15.874
And he hungers
for Earth most of all.

00:15:17.394 --> 00:15:19.234
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

00:15:19.754 --> 00:15:21.834
A ritual to contact Dormammu

00:15:21.914 --> 00:15:23.434
and draw power from
the Dark Dimension.

00:15:26.874 --> 00:15:29.474
Uh... Okay...

00:15:30.234 --> 00:15:32.074
Um... I'm out.

00:15:32.914 --> 00:15:35.394
I came here to heal my hands.

00:15:36.194 --> 00:15:39.474
Not to fight in
some mystical war.

00:15:41.714 --> 00:15:42.754
London.

00:15:47.554 --> 00:15:48.594
Kaecilius!

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:49.914
No!

00:15:56.154 --> 00:15:57.994
Wong? Mordo?

00:16:52.381 --> 00:16:53.421
Nailed it!

00:17:02.701 --> 00:17:04.741
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:37.501
<i>The final phase of your
training will be a stealth incursion.</i>

00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:38.701
It's freezing!

00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:41.141
You couldn't make a
suit with a flannel lining?

00:17:41.981 --> 00:17:44.701
You must retrieve this
prototype of a signal decoy.

00:17:44.781 --> 00:17:47.541
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

00:17:47.621 --> 00:17:49.301
We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:51.261
that Cross installed
in the Futures vault.

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:54.221
It's currently collecting dust

00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:57.461
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities in upstate New York.

00:17:57.581 --> 00:17:59.501
<i>Should be a piece of cake.</i>

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.501
You're over the target area.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.861
Disengage now, Scott!

00:18:03.941 --> 00:18:05.061
Squadron A, go!

00:18:05.141 --> 00:18:06.501
B, go!

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:09.981
C, go!

00:18:10.941 --> 00:18:13.501
All right, Ant-thony, please
don't drop me this time.

00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:17.661
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

00:18:17.741 --> 00:18:18.781
Stay calm.

00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:22.501
Guys? We might have a problem.

00:18:22.581 --> 00:18:26.021
Hank, didn't you say this
was some old warehouse?

00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:27.141
It's not!

00:18:28.541 --> 00:18:30.421
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:34.581
Scott, get out of there. Abort!

00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:35.781
<i>Abort now!</i>

00:18:35.861 --> 00:18:38.621
No, it's okay.
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:40.701
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:42.701
He's gonna lose the suit.

00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:44.261
He's gonna lose his life.

00:18:46.678 --> 00:18:48.518
<i>Hello, Mr. Barnes.</i>

00:18:49.198 --> 00:18:51.558
<i>I've been sent by the United
Nations to evaluate you.</i>

00:18:51.718 --> 00:18:54.038
<i>Do you mind if I sit?</i>

00:18:58.878 --> 00:19:00.558
<i>Your first name is James?</i>

00:19:02.078 --> 00:19:03.998
The receipt for your gear.

00:19:05.838 --> 00:19:07.518
"Bird costume"? Come on.

00:19:07.718 --> 00:19:09.358
I didn't write it.

00:19:15.358 --> 00:19:17.038
<i>I'm not here to judge you.</i>

00:19:17.438 --> 00:19:18.918
<i>I just want to ask
you a few questions.</i>

00:19:20.678 --> 00:19:22.918
<i>Do you know where
you are, James?</i>

00:19:26.078 --> 00:19:28.878
<i>I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.</i>

00:19:29.758 --> 00:19:31.398
<i>My name is Bucky.</i>

00:19:56.678 --> 00:19:57.798
Why would the Task Force

00:19:57.878 --> 00:19:59.438
release this photo
to begin with?

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:02.118
Get the word out, involve
as many eyes as we can?

00:20:02.278 --> 00:20:05.158
Right. It's a good way to
flush a guy out of hiding.

00:20:05.318 --> 00:20:07.318
Set off a bomb, get
your picture taken.

00:20:07.478 --> 00:20:08.518
Get seven billion people looking

00:20:08.598 --> 00:20:09.598
for the Winter Soldier.

00:20:09.678 --> 00:20:11.518
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?

00:20:11.678 --> 00:20:12.678
Steve, we looked for
the guy for two years

00:20:12.838 --> 00:20:13.798
and found nothing.

00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.958
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.

00:20:16.038 --> 00:20:17.358
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee

00:20:17.438 --> 00:20:18.598
that whoever framed
him would get him.

00:20:18.678 --> 00:20:20.518
It guarantees that we would.

00:20:26.718 --> 00:20:27.718
Yeah.

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:36.847
Hello?

00:20:43.927 --> 00:20:45.007
Hey!

00:21:01.443 --> 00:21:02.843
Tell me, Bucky.

00:21:03.123 --> 00:21:05.483
You've seen a great
deal, haven't you?

00:21:06.843 --> 00:21:08.923
<i>I don't wanna talk about it.</i>

00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:12.243
You fear that if you
open your mouth,

00:21:12.323 --> 00:21:14.123
the horrors might never stop.

00:21:17.803 --> 00:21:18.843
Don't worry.

00:21:22.003 --> 00:21:24.323
We only have to talk about one.

00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:50.709
Come on, guys, get
me eyes on Barnes.

00:21:51.431 --> 00:21:53.991
Friday, get me a
source on that outage.

00:21:55.311 --> 00:21:57.431
Sub-level five, East Wing.

00:22:00.831 --> 00:22:02.311
What the hell is this?

00:22:02.471 --> 00:22:04.151
Why don't we discuss your home?

00:22:04.311 --> 00:22:07.311
Not Romania.
Certainly not Brooklyn, no.

00:22:08.351 --> 00:22:11.871
I mean your real home.

00:22:19.951 --> 00:22:20.991
No.

00:22:23.311 --> 00:22:24.311
Stop.

00:22:28.271 --> 00:22:29.271
Stop.

00:23:19.711 --> 00:23:25.111
Mission report.
December 16, 1991.

00:23:35.751 --> 00:23:37.111
Help me.

00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:38.711
Help.

00:23:41.871 --> 00:23:42.871
Get up.

00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:48.071
Who are you? What do you want?

00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:51.551
To see an empire fall.

00:24:23.551 --> 00:24:24.551
Hey.

00:24:31.271 --> 00:24:32.671
Evac all civilians.

00:24:32.831 --> 00:24:33.911
Get me a perimeter
around the building,

00:24:33.991 --> 00:24:35.111
and gunships in the air.

00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:36.791
Please tell me
you brought a suit.

00:24:36.951 --> 00:24:37.991
Sure did.
It's a lovely Tom Ford,

00:24:38.111 --> 00:24:39.431
three-piece, two-button.

00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:41.111
I'm an active-duty
non-combatant.

00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:43.111
Follow me.

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:00.831
<i>We're in position.</i>

00:25:33.391 --> 00:25:35.391
You could at least recognize me.

00:26:28.152 --> 00:26:29.651
Damn it.

00:28:13.386 --> 00:28:14.466
Hello?

00:28:43.746 --> 00:28:44.826
Hello?

00:29:23.506 --> 00:29:27.146
Daniel, I see they made
you master of this Sanctum.

00:29:28.226 --> 00:29:30.306
You know what that means?

00:29:30.866 --> 00:29:32.506
That you'll die protecting it.

00:29:48.506 --> 00:29:49.746
Stop!

00:30:01.106 --> 00:30:03.426
How long have you been
at Kamar-Taj, Mister...

00:30:03.706 --> 00:30:04.866
Doctor.

00:30:06.306 --> 00:30:07.306
Mister Doctor?

00:30:07.866 --> 00:30:09.346
It's Strange.

00:30:11.026 --> 00:30:13.346
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

00:32:31.786 --> 00:32:32.826
Ha!

00:32:38.546 --> 00:32:40.506
You don't know how
to use that, do you?

00:32:41.506 --> 00:32:42.666
Uh...

00:34:25.626 --> 00:34:27.106
What?

00:34:32.106 --> 00:34:33.506
Oh, stop it.

00:34:33.626 --> 00:34:34.626
I said stop it.

00:34:34.786 --> 00:34:36.146
You cannot stop
this, Mister Doctor.

00:34:36.466 --> 00:34:38.786
I don't even know
what "this" is.

00:34:38.946 --> 00:34:39.986
It's the end...

00:34:40.306 --> 00:34:41.986
and the beginning.

00:34:43.474 --> 00:34:46.234
The many becoming the
few becoming the One.

00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:48.106
If you're not gonna
start making sense...

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:49.786
I'm just gonna to have
to put this thing back on.

00:34:49.986 --> 00:34:51.066
Tell me, Mister Doctor...

00:34:51.706 --> 00:34:54.466
My name is Doctor
Stephen Strange.

00:34:54.786 --> 00:34:56.306
- You are a doctor?
- Yeah.

00:34:56.466 --> 00:34:57.466
A scientist.

00:34:58.066 --> 00:34:59.626
You understand
the laws of nature.

00:34:59.986 --> 00:35:03.146
All things age. All things die.

00:35:03.226 --> 00:35:04.746
In the end, our sun burns out.

00:35:04.826 --> 00:35:07.106
Our universe grows
cold and perishes.

00:35:07.746 --> 00:35:08.986
But the Dark Dimension...

00:35:10.573 --> 00:35:11.826
it's a place beyond time.

00:35:12.066 --> 00:35:13.586
That's it.
I'm putting this thing back on.

00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:15.066
This world doesn't
have to die, doctor.

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:17.906
This world can take its rightful
place alongside so many others...

00:35:18.066 --> 00:35:19.346
as part of the One.

00:35:20.026 --> 00:35:21.826
The great and beautiful One.

00:35:22.666 --> 00:35:24.346
We can all live forever.

00:35:24.666 --> 00:35:25.866
Really?

00:35:28.066 --> 00:35:31.146
What do you have to gain out of
this New Age dimensional utopia?

00:35:32.186 --> 00:35:33.226
The same as you.

00:35:33.466 --> 00:35:36.186
The same as everyone.
Life. Eternal life.

00:35:36.786 --> 00:35:38.706
People think in terms
of good and evil...

00:35:38.986 --> 00:35:40.666
when really time is
the true enemy of us all.

00:35:40.826 --> 00:35:42.506
Time kills everything.

00:35:42.786 --> 00:35:44.346
What about the
people you killed?

00:35:44.626 --> 00:35:45.746
Tiny.

00:35:45.826 --> 00:35:48.266
Momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

00:35:50.386 --> 00:35:52.266
Yes. You see.

00:35:53.106 --> 00:35:55.106
You see what we're doing.

00:35:55.746 --> 00:35:57.466
The world is not
what it ought to be.

00:35:57.546 --> 00:36:00.066
Humanity longs
for the eternal...

00:36:00.146 --> 00:36:02.866
for a world beyond time,
because time is what enslaves us.

00:36:02.946 --> 00:36:05.186
Time is an insult.

00:36:05.306 --> 00:36:06.906
Death is an insult.

00:36:08.346 --> 00:36:09.586
Doctor...

00:36:10.546 --> 00:36:13.066
we don't seek
to rule this world.

00:36:13.146 --> 00:36:14.386
We seek to save it...

00:36:14.466 --> 00:36:17.986
to hand it over to Dormammu,
who is the intent of all evolution...

00:36:18.986 --> 00:36:20.786
the why of all existence.

00:36:21.826 --> 00:36:24.706
The Sorcerer Supreme
defends existence.

00:36:26.106 --> 00:36:28.506
What was it that brought
you to Kamar-Taj, doctor?

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:30.026
Was it enlightenment?

00:36:30.826 --> 00:36:32.026
Power?

00:36:33.866 --> 00:36:36.266
You came to be
healed, as did we all.

00:36:38.066 --> 00:36:40.626
Kamar-Taj is a place
that collects broken things.

00:36:40.706 --> 00:36:42.706
We all come with the
promise of being healed...

00:36:42.786 --> 00:36:45.586
and instead The Ancient
One gives us parlor tricks.

00:36:46.866 --> 00:36:49.466
The real magic she
keeps for herself.

00:36:49.546 --> 00:36:52.866
You ever wonder how she
managed to live this long?

00:36:58.146 --> 00:37:00.466
I saw the rituals in
<i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

00:37:00.746 --> 00:37:02.986
So, you know.

00:37:03.306 --> 00:37:04.906
The ritual gives me the power

00:37:04.986 --> 00:37:06.306
to overthrow The Ancient One...

00:37:06.386 --> 00:37:08.146
and tear her Sanctums down.

00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:10.866
To let the Dark Dimension in.

00:37:10.946 --> 00:37:12.986
Because what The
Ancient One hoards,

00:37:13.266 --> 00:37:14.706
Dormammu gives freely.

00:37:15.546 --> 00:37:17.026
Life everlasting.

00:37:17.786 --> 00:37:20.146
He's not the destroyer
of worlds, doctor.

00:37:20.226 --> 00:37:22.146
He's the savior of worlds.

00:37:23.186 --> 00:37:24.466
No. I mean, come on.

00:37:24.546 --> 00:37:26.386
Look at your face.

00:37:26.826 --> 00:37:28.906
Dormammu made you a murderer.

00:37:28.986 --> 00:37:31.226
Just how good can
his kingdom be?

00:37:33.186 --> 00:37:34.706
You think that's funny?

00:37:35.186 --> 00:37:36.826
No, not that.

00:37:37.026 --> 00:37:39.426
What's funny is that
you've lost your sling ring.

00:38:05.574 --> 00:38:06.614
Hey, Cap!

00:38:19.414 --> 00:38:20.494
Steve.

00:38:21.494 --> 00:38:23.734
Which Bucky am I talking to?

00:38:25.334 --> 00:38:27.414
Your mom's name was Sarah.

00:38:31.534 --> 00:38:34.774
You used to wear
newspapers in your shoes.

00:38:36.214 --> 00:38:37.414
Can't read that in a museum.

00:38:37.574 --> 00:38:39.294
Just like that, we're
supposed to be cool?

00:38:39.654 --> 00:38:40.974
What did I do?

00:38:41.054 --> 00:38:42.054
Enough.

00:38:42.134 --> 00:38:43.934
Oh, God, I knew
this would happen.

00:38:44.094 --> 00:38:46.374
Everything HYDRA put
inside me is still there.

00:38:46.534 --> 00:38:48.494
All he had to do was
say the goddamn words.

00:38:48.694 --> 00:38:50.294
Who was he? I don't know.

00:38:50.454 --> 00:38:52.534
People are dead.
The bombing, the setup...

00:38:52.654 --> 00:38:54.974
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.

00:38:55.134 --> 00:38:56.934
I need you to do better
than "I don't know."

00:39:00.694 --> 00:39:03.334
He wanted to know about Siberia.

00:39:05.974 --> 00:39:07.694
Where I was kept.

00:39:09.494 --> 00:39:11.254
He wanted to know exactly where.

00:39:11.414 --> 00:39:13.734
Why would he need to know that?

00:39:15.774 --> 00:39:18.134
Because I'm not the
only Winter Soldier.

00:41:18.814 --> 00:41:19.934
Who were they?

00:41:20.134 --> 00:41:21.694
Their most elite death squad.

00:41:21.854 --> 00:41:23.974
More kills than anyone
in HYDRA history.

00:41:24.134 --> 00:41:25.414
And that was before the serum.

00:41:25.574 --> 00:41:26.694
They all turn out like you?

00:41:26.854 --> 00:41:28.014
Worse.

00:41:28.574 --> 00:41:30.414
The doctor, could
he control them?

00:41:31.334 --> 00:41:32.774
Enough.

00:41:32.934 --> 00:41:34.774
Said he wanted to
see an empire fall.

00:41:34.934 --> 00:41:36.614
With these guys, he could do it.

00:41:36.814 --> 00:41:39.174
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...

00:41:39.334 --> 00:41:41.574
infiltrate, assassinate,
destabilize.

00:41:41.654 --> 00:41:43.174
They can take a
whole country down

00:41:43.254 --> 00:41:44.734
in one night, you'd
never see them coming.

00:41:47.454 --> 00:41:49.494
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.

00:41:50.054 --> 00:41:52.214
If we call Tony...
No, he won't believe us.

00:41:52.294 --> 00:41:53.294
Even if he did...

00:41:53.374 --> 00:41:55.174
Who knows if the
Accords would let him help.

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:57.614
We're on our own.

00:41:59.014 --> 00:42:00.054
Maybe not.

00:42:01.894 --> 00:42:03.534
I know a guy.

00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:11.355
<i>All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.</i>

00:42:12.635 --> 00:42:14.115
Somebody's home, Scott.

00:42:17.235 --> 00:42:18.595
<i>What's going on down there, Sam?</i>

00:42:18.675 --> 00:42:19.795
It's the Falcon!

00:42:20.475 --> 00:42:22.555
I had a sensor trip but
I'm not seeing anything.

00:42:23.155 --> 00:42:24.115
Wait a second.

00:42:24.235 --> 00:42:26.235
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

00:42:26.315 --> 00:42:27.795
It's okay. He can't see me.

00:42:27.875 --> 00:42:28.955
I can see you.

00:42:29.075 --> 00:42:30.195
He can see me.

00:42:32.555 --> 00:42:34.475
Hi. I'm Scott.

00:42:34.555 --> 00:42:36.155
Did he just say,
"Hi, I'm Scott"?

00:42:36.235 --> 00:42:37.875
What are you doing here?

00:42:37.995 --> 00:42:39.555
First off, I'm a big fan.

00:42:39.635 --> 00:42:41.235
Appreciate it.
So, who the hell are you?

00:42:42.075 --> 00:42:43.275
I'm Ant-Man.

00:42:43.355 --> 00:42:44.595
"Ant-Man"?

00:42:44.675 --> 00:42:46.795
What? You haven't heard of me?

00:42:46.875 --> 00:42:48.595
No, you wouldn't
have heard of me.

00:42:49.035 --> 00:42:50.515
You wanna tell me what you want?

00:42:50.595 --> 00:42:52.995
I was hoping I could
grab a piece of technology.

00:42:53.075 --> 00:42:54.795
Just for a few days.
I'm gonna return it.

00:42:54.875 --> 00:42:57.515
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

00:42:57.595 --> 00:42:58.995
I know exactly how that is.

00:42:59.915 --> 00:43:00.955
Located the breach.

00:43:01.035 --> 00:43:02.195
Bringing him in.
Sorry about this!

00:43:06.995 --> 00:43:08.515
What the hell are you doing?

00:43:11.435 --> 00:43:12.675
Breach is an adult male,

00:43:12.795 --> 00:43:14.115
who has some sort
of shrinking tech.

00:43:27.355 --> 00:43:28.515
Sorry!

00:43:28.595 --> 00:43:30.115
Look, I'm sorry about this.
Sorry.

00:43:30.915 --> 00:43:31.915
That's enough!

00:43:54.995 --> 00:43:56.635
Ant-thony! A little help!

00:44:09.275 --> 00:44:10.355
I've lost visual.

00:44:19.675 --> 00:44:20.915
He's inside my pack!

00:44:20.995 --> 00:44:21.995
Sorry!

00:44:23.635 --> 00:44:24.635
You seem like a
really great guy.

00:44:49.995 --> 00:44:53.795
It's really important to me that
Cap never finds out about this.

00:45:51.041 --> 00:45:52.121
Sir, can I help you?

00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:53.401
Doctor Palmer, where is she?

00:45:53.601 --> 00:45:55.081
- Sir. We need to get...
- Where is she?

00:45:55.161 --> 00:45:56.681
The nurse's station.

00:45:56.761 --> 00:45:57.841
Christine!

00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:01.001
Stephen?

00:46:01.081 --> 00:46:02.161
Oh, my God.

00:46:02.281 --> 00:46:04.841
Get me in an operating theater now.
Just you.

00:46:04.921 --> 00:46:06.041
Now! I haven't any time.

00:46:06.681 --> 00:46:07.761
What happened?

00:46:07.841 --> 00:46:10.801
I was stabbed.
Cardiac tamponade.

00:46:11.801 --> 00:46:13.321
What are you wearing?

00:46:20.001 --> 00:46:21.001
Chest cavity is clear.

00:46:21.081 --> 00:46:23.841
No, the blood is in
the pericardial sac.

00:46:26.801 --> 00:46:27.961
No, no, no.

00:46:28.041 --> 00:46:29.041
Stephen?

00:46:30.641 --> 00:46:31.841
Come on, come on.

00:46:57.561 --> 00:46:59.761
Just a little higher.

00:47:01.041 --> 00:47:02.241
Please be careful
with the needle.

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.321
Stephen?

00:47:08.081 --> 00:47:09.081
What am I seeing?

00:47:09.321 --> 00:47:11.121
My astral body.

00:47:12.401 --> 00:47:13.401
Are you dead?

00:47:13.721 --> 00:47:15.281
No, Christine. But I am dying.

00:47:17.521 --> 00:47:19.401
Right.

00:47:20.841 --> 00:47:21.841
Yeah. All right.

00:47:22.601 --> 00:47:23.601
Okay.

00:47:27.001 --> 00:47:28.841
Oh, wow.

00:47:33.361 --> 00:47:35.321
I've never seen
a wound like this.

00:47:35.841 --> 00:47:37.281
What were you stabbed with?

00:47:37.801 --> 00:47:39.041
I don't know.

00:47:58.881 --> 00:48:00.561
I'm gonna have to vanish now.

00:48:00.801 --> 00:48:02.001
What?

00:48:02.081 --> 00:48:03.641
Keep me alive, will you?

00:48:04.761 --> 00:48:06.201
Huh?

00:48:06.721 --> 00:48:08.761
Okay.

00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:11.281
Uh-huh.

00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:34.281
Oh, shit.

00:49:11.561 --> 00:49:13.121
Come on, come on.

00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:19.281
Stephen, come on.

00:49:22.001 --> 00:49:23.401
Hit me again.

00:49:23.521 --> 00:49:25.081
Stop doing that!

00:49:25.401 --> 00:49:27.041
Up the voltage and hit me again.

00:49:27.121 --> 00:49:28.161
No, your heart's beating!

00:49:28.361 --> 00:49:29.601
Just do it!

00:49:30.361 --> 00:49:32.081
Oh, my God.

00:50:01.161 --> 00:50:03.161
Oh, God! Oh, God!

00:50:03.321 --> 00:50:04.361
Are you okay?

00:50:04.521 --> 00:50:05.601
Yeah.

00:50:05.681 --> 00:50:06.761
Okay.

00:50:09.147 --> 00:50:12.667
That was completely
irresponsible and dangerous!

00:50:13.347 --> 00:50:15.627
You jeopardized everything!

00:50:31.547 --> 00:50:33.187
You got it.

00:50:36.187 --> 00:50:37.147
Well done.

00:50:37.227 --> 00:50:38.227
Wait a minute.

00:50:38.307 --> 00:50:39.707
Did you just compliment me?

00:50:39.827 --> 00:50:40.947
He did, didn't he?

00:50:41.067 --> 00:50:42.227
Kind of sounded like he did.

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:45.587
I was good, wasn't I?

00:50:47.147 --> 00:50:50.787
Hey, how about the fact that I
fought an Avenger and didn't die?

00:50:50.867 --> 00:50:53.307
Let us not dwell on the past.

00:50:53.387 --> 00:50:55.547
We gotta finish our planning.

00:50:57.867 --> 00:50:59.547
Don't mind him.

00:51:00.067 --> 00:51:01.107
You did good.

00:51:07.987 --> 00:51:09.227
Darren.

00:51:12.227 --> 00:51:13.867
How the hell did
you get in here?

00:51:15.107 --> 00:51:17.387
You left the front
door open, Hank.

00:51:17.747 --> 00:51:18.747
It's official.

00:51:18.827 --> 00:51:19.907
You're old.

00:51:20.547 --> 00:51:21.707
The plans.

00:51:23.067 --> 00:51:24.707
He will kill him.

00:51:27.907 --> 00:51:30.627
Well, to what do I
owe this pleasure?

00:51:31.667 --> 00:51:33.147
I have good news.

00:51:33.227 --> 00:51:34.467
Really?

00:51:35.267 --> 00:51:36.267
What's that?

00:51:36.907 --> 00:51:41.507
Pym Tech, the
company you created,

00:51:41.587 --> 00:51:43.467
is about to become
one of the most

00:51:43.587 --> 00:51:45.427
profitable operations
in the world.

00:51:45.507 --> 00:51:49.267
We're anticipating $15 billion
in sales, tomorrow alone.

00:51:55.867 --> 00:51:57.027
You're welcome.

00:52:01.307 --> 00:52:03.827
I know this is odd, but
I'd like you to be there.

00:52:04.507 --> 00:52:06.467
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

00:52:07.747 --> 00:52:09.307
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

00:52:09.387 --> 00:52:10.707
I'll be there.

00:52:27.747 --> 00:52:29.147
What did you see in me?

00:52:30.347 --> 00:52:31.787
I don't know what you mean.

00:52:32.707 --> 00:52:35.267
All those years
ago, you picked me.

00:52:35.347 --> 00:52:36.867
What did you see?

00:52:39.027 --> 00:52:40.787
I saw myself.

00:52:41.427 --> 00:52:43.787
Then why did you push me away?

00:52:45.347 --> 00:52:48.707
Because I saw
too much of myself.

00:53:07.403 --> 00:53:09.403
After all this time...

00:53:09.563 --> 00:53:11.403
you just show up here...

00:53:12.883 --> 00:53:15.003
flying out of your body.

00:53:15.163 --> 00:53:16.883
Yeah, I know.

00:53:17.043 --> 00:53:18.563
I missed you, too, by the way.

00:53:19.483 --> 00:53:20.563
Ha ha.

00:53:20.643 --> 00:53:23.283
I wrote you emails, but
you never responded.

00:53:23.363 --> 00:53:24.563
Why would I?

00:53:25.523 --> 00:53:27.803
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

00:53:28.923 --> 00:53:30.723
For all of it. You were right.

00:53:30.963 --> 00:53:34.483
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly.

00:53:34.563 --> 00:53:37.043
And you deserved so much more.

00:53:37.243 --> 00:53:38.683
Stop. You're clearly in shock.

00:53:40.603 --> 00:53:42.923
What the hell is happening?

00:53:43.083 --> 00:53:44.363
Where have you been?

00:53:45.323 --> 00:53:48.483
Well, after Western
medicine failed me...

00:53:48.563 --> 00:53:51.523
I headed east, and I
ended up in Kathmandu.

00:53:51.763 --> 00:53:52.763
Kathmandu?

00:53:52.843 --> 00:53:54.083
Yeah.

00:53:55.003 --> 00:53:56.323
Like the Bob Seger song?

00:53:56.603 --> 00:53:58.403
1975, <i>Beautiful Loser,</i> side A.
Yeah.

00:53:58.603 --> 00:54:02.283
I went to a place
called Kamar-Taj...

00:54:02.443 --> 00:54:06.123
and I talked to someone
called "The Ancient One."

00:54:06.763 --> 00:54:08.203
Oh. So you joined a cult.

00:54:08.283 --> 00:54:10.923
No, I didn't.
No, not exactly. No.

00:54:11.123 --> 00:54:13.803
They did teach me to tap into
powers that I never even knew existed.

00:54:13.963 --> 00:54:15.243
Yeah. That sounds like a cult.

00:54:15.443 --> 00:54:16.643
It's not a cult.

00:54:16.923 --> 00:54:18.123
Well, that's what
a cultist would say.

00:54:18.403 --> 00:54:19.403
Oh, no.

00:54:20.003 --> 00:54:22.443
Wait. Stephen, wait.
What do you think you're doing?

00:54:22.723 --> 00:54:24.283
I'm late for a cult meeting.

00:54:28.123 --> 00:54:29.203
This is insane.

00:54:29.283 --> 00:54:30.363
Yeah.

00:54:30.483 --> 00:54:32.483
- Where are you going?
- Um...

00:54:32.963 --> 00:54:34.443
Can you tell me the truth?

00:54:34.723 --> 00:54:37.043
Well, a powerful sorcerer

00:54:37.123 --> 00:54:38.883
who gave himself over
to an ancient entity...

00:54:38.963 --> 00:54:41.563
can bend the very laws of
physics, tried very hard to kill me.

00:54:41.643 --> 00:54:43.483
But I left him chained
up in Greenwich Village...

00:54:43.563 --> 00:54:45.923
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway...

00:54:46.163 --> 00:54:47.243
that I opened up
in the mop closet.

00:54:47.323 --> 00:54:49.203
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:01.323
Really do have to go.

00:55:02.403 --> 00:55:03.483
Yeah.

00:55:14.031 --> 00:55:16.231
<i>He asked me again if
you were going to be there.</i>

00:55:16.311 --> 00:55:18.311
<i>I said I wasn't sure.</i>

00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:21.231
<i>You should have seen his little face.
Just try, okay?</i>

00:55:21.831 --> 00:55:23.591
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

00:55:23.751 --> 00:55:25.191
<i>I love you.</i>
