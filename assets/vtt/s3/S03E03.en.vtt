WEBVTT

00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:11.965
Challenge round, Billy.

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.005
Oh, come on, Billy, you've
got to be messing with me.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:19.525
No, doctor.

00:04:20.445 --> 00:04:22.645
<i>Feels So Good,</i>
Chuck Mangione, 1977.

00:04:23.365 --> 00:04:25.405
Honestly, Billy, you said
this one would be hard.

00:04:25.645 --> 00:04:27.525
- Ha! It's 1978.
- No, Billy.

00:04:27.765 --> 00:04:30.125
While <i>Feels So Good</i>
may have charted in 1978...

00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:33.725
the album was released
in December of 1977.

00:04:33.885 --> 00:04:35.485
No.
Wikipedia says it's a nineteen...

00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:36.565
Check again.

00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:37.845
Where do you store

00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:38.965
all this useless information?

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:40.045
Useless?

00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:41.805
The man charted a top
10 hit with a flugelhorn.

00:04:42.885 --> 00:04:43.885
Status, Billy?

00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:45.085
1977.

00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:46.445
- Oh, please.
- I hate you.

00:04:46.645 --> 00:04:47.725
Oh!

00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:49.725
Feels so good, doesn't it?

00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:54.925
Oh, I got this, Stephen.

00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:56.845
You've done your bit.
Go ahead. We'll close up.

00:04:57.965 --> 00:04:58.925
What is it?

00:04:59.005 --> 00:05:00.205
GSW.

00:05:01.485 --> 00:05:02.765
It's amazing you kept him alive.

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:04.405
Apneic, failed the
brain stem test...

00:05:04.685 --> 00:05:05.885
and the apnea reflex test.

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:08.605
I think I found the
problem, Doctor Palmer.

00:05:08.845 --> 00:05:10.325
You left a bullet in his head.

00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:12.005
Thanks.
It's impinging on the medulla.

00:05:12.205 --> 00:05:14.605
I needed a specialist.
Nic diagnosed brain death.

00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:16.445
Something about that
doesn't feel right to me.

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:17.565
We have to run.

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.085
Doctor West.

00:05:20.365 --> 00:05:21.605
What are you doing? Hey.

00:05:21.685 --> 00:05:23.085
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:24.685
Slow down.
I did not agree to that.

00:05:24.965 --> 00:05:26.885
I don't need you to.
We've already called brain death.

00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:28.045
Prematurely.
We need to get him prepped

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:29.165
for sub-occipital craniotomy.

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:31.085
Not gonna let you
operate on a dead man.

00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:32.605
What do you see?

00:05:32.845 --> 00:05:34.645
- A bullet?
- A perfect bullet.

00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:37.565
It's been hardened. You harden a
bullet by alloying lead with antimony.

00:05:37.885 --> 00:05:41.365
A toxic metal. And that's leeched
directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:43.205
Rapid onset central
nervous system shutdown.

00:05:43.285 --> 00:05:44.285
We gotta go.

00:05:44.525 --> 00:05:45.885
The patient's not
dead, but he is dying.

00:05:45.965 --> 00:05:47.365
Still want to
harvest his organs?

00:05:48.445 --> 00:05:49.805
- I'll assist you.
- No.

00:05:50.045 --> 00:05:51.925
Doctor Palmer will assist me.

00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:09.725
Thank you.

00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:18.005
Image guidance, stat.

00:06:18.165 --> 00:06:19.645
We don't have time for that.

00:06:20.405 --> 00:06:21.405
You can't do it freehand.

00:06:21.645 --> 00:06:22.805
I can and I will.

00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:24.725
This isn't a time for
showing off, Strange.

00:06:24.965 --> 00:06:25.965
How about 10 minutes ago

00:06:26.045 --> 00:06:28.645
when you called the
wrong time of death?

00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:39.165
<i>Cranial nerves intact.</i>

00:07:04.045 --> 00:07:06.485
Doctor West, cover your watch.

00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:51.845
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

00:07:51.925 --> 00:07:53.405
I didn't have to save
his patient, either.

00:07:53.485 --> 00:07:56.205
But I sometimes
just can't help myself.

00:07:56.285 --> 00:07:57.685
Nic is a great doctor.

00:07:57.765 --> 00:07:58.925
You came to me.

00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:00.405
Yeah, well, I needed
a second opinion.

00:08:00.485 --> 00:08:01.565
You had a second opinion.

00:08:01.645 --> 00:08:03.045
What you needed
was a competent one.

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:04.205
Well, all the more reason

00:08:04.325 --> 00:08:05.365
why you should be my
neurosurgeon on call.

00:08:05.445 --> 00:08:06.885
You could make
such a difference.

00:08:06.965 --> 00:08:08.565
I can't work in
your butcher shop.

00:08:08.645 --> 00:08:09.725
Hey!

00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:10.885
I'm fusing transected
spinal cords.

00:08:10.965 --> 00:08:13.165
I'm stimulating neurogenesis
in the central nervous system.

00:08:13.245 --> 00:08:15.525
The work I'm doing is gonna
save thousands for years to come.

00:08:15.605 --> 00:08:18.045
In ER, you get to save
one drunk idiot with a gun.

00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:19.165
Yeah, you're right.

00:08:19.245 --> 00:08:20.685
In ER, we're only saving lives.

00:08:20.765 --> 00:08:22.565
There's no fame, there's no, uh,

00:08:22.645 --> 00:08:24.325
CNN interviews.

00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:26.285
I guess I'll just have
to stick with Nic.

00:08:26.365 --> 00:08:27.405
Whoa, wait a minute.

00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:28.765
You're not... You guys aren't...

00:08:28.845 --> 00:08:30.085
What?

00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:32.925
Sleeping together? Sorry, I thought
that was implicit in my disgust.

00:08:33.005 --> 00:08:34.525
Explicit, actually.

00:08:34.645 --> 00:08:36.885
No, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

00:08:36.965 --> 00:08:37.965
Oh, really?

00:08:38.045 --> 00:08:39.125
I call it the "Strange Policy."

00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:41.725
Oh, well, good, I'm glad
something's named after me.

00:08:42.365 --> 00:08:44.165
I invented a
laminectomy procedure.

00:08:44.405 --> 00:08:46.965
And yet, somehow no one seems to
want to call it the "Strange Technique."

00:08:47.165 --> 00:08:48.685
We invented that technique.

00:08:48.885 --> 00:08:51.245
Regardless, I'm very
flattered by your policy.

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:56.605
I'm talking tonight at a
Neurological Society dinner.

00:08:56.765 --> 00:08:58.045
Come with me.

00:08:58.205 --> 00:08:59.885
Another speaking engagement?

00:09:00.005 --> 00:09:01.005
So romantic.

00:09:01.245 --> 00:09:03.005
You used to love coming
to those things with me.

00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:04.325
We had fun together.

00:09:04.405 --> 00:09:06.085
No! You had fun.

00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:07.925
They weren't about
us, they were about you.

00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:10.125
Not only about me.

00:09:10.365 --> 00:09:13.205
Stephen.
Everything is about you.

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.725
Maybe we could hyphenate.

00:09:15.885 --> 00:09:17.885
Strange-Palmer Technique.

00:09:18.045 --> 00:09:19.845
Palmer-Strange.

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:09.165
Billy.

00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:10.525
What have you got for me?

00:10:10.605 --> 00:10:11.885
<i>I've got a 35-year-old
Air Force Colonel...</i>

00:10:12.285 --> 00:10:15.405
<i>crushed his lower spine in some
kind of thoracic burst fracture.</i>

00:10:15.555 --> 00:10:16.915
Yeah, well, I could help...

00:10:17.155 --> 00:10:18.195
but so could 50 other people.

00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:19.835
Find me something worth my time.

00:10:20.115 --> 00:10:23.235
<i>I have a 68-year-old female with
an advanced brain stem glioma.</i>

00:10:23.995 --> 00:10:26.115
Yeah, you want me to
screw up my perfect record?

00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:27.675
Definitely not.

00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:28.875
<i>How about a
22-year-old female...</i>

00:10:30.235 --> 00:10:32.315
<i>with an electronic implant in her
brain to control schizophrenia...</i>

00:10:32.395 --> 00:10:33.635
<i>struck by lightning?</i>

00:10:33.715 --> 00:10:35.235
Mmm.
That does sound interesting.

00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:38.555
Can you send me the...

00:10:38.755 --> 00:10:40.435
Got it.

00:11:42.275 --> 00:11:43.275
Hey.

00:11:44.995 --> 00:11:47.075
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:03.075
What did they do?

00:12:04.355 --> 00:12:06.515
They rushed you in a chopper.

00:12:06.635 --> 00:12:08.715
But it took a little
while to find you.

00:12:09.675 --> 00:12:12.955
The golden hours for nerve damage
went by while you were in the car.

00:12:13.075 --> 00:12:15.715
What did they do?

00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:21.595
11 stainless steel
pins in the bones.

00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:24.635
Multiple torn ligaments...

00:12:25.475 --> 00:12:27.835
severe nerve
damage in both hands.

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:31.315
You were on the
table for 11 hours.

00:12:31.395 --> 00:12:33.315
Look at these fixators.

00:12:35.315 --> 00:12:36.915
No one could have done better.

00:12:43.035 --> 00:12:45.275
I could have done better.

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:53.556
My mom tried to talk
me out of enlisting...

00:12:53.716 --> 00:12:55.156
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.516
She bought me my
first thigh holster.

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.316
Very practical.

00:12:59.516 --> 00:13:01.036
And stylish.

00:13:06.676 --> 00:13:08.996
CIA has you stationed
over here now?

00:13:09.156 --> 00:13:10.916
Berlin.
Joint Terrorism Task Force.

00:13:11.276 --> 00:13:13.356
Right. Right. Sounds fun.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.436
I know, right?

00:13:17.956 --> 00:13:20.236
I've been meaning to ask you.

00:13:20.396 --> 00:13:23.556
When you were spying
on me from across the hall...

00:13:23.716 --> 00:13:25.036
You mean when I
was doing my job.

00:13:28.036 --> 00:13:29.196
Did Peggy know?

00:13:31.636 --> 00:13:33.556
She kept so many secrets.

00:13:34.396 --> 00:13:36.036
I didn't want her to
have one from you.

00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:41.876
Thanks for walking me back.

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:43.396
Sure.

00:13:46.916 --> 00:13:48.076
Steve.

00:13:48.276 --> 00:13:50.036
There's something you gotta see.

00:13:50.236 --> 00:13:51.916
<i>A bomb hidden in a news van...</i>

00:13:52.116 --> 00:13:53.156
Who's coordinating?

00:13:53.236 --> 00:13:54.236
<i>ripped through the
UN building in Vienna.</i>

00:13:54.316 --> 00:13:55.356
Good. They're solid. Forensics?

00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:56.436
<i>More than 70 people
have been injured.</i>

00:13:56.596 --> 00:13:58.036
<i>At least 12 are dead,</i>

00:13:58.116 --> 00:14:00.396
<i>including Wakanda's
King T'Chaka.</i>

00:14:00.556 --> 00:14:02.396
<i>Officials have released
a video of a suspect...</i>

00:14:02.556 --> 00:14:04.996
<i>who they have identified as
James Buchanan Barnes...</i>

00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:06.556
<i>the Winter Soldier.</i>

00:14:06.756 --> 00:14:08.116
<i>The infamous HYDRA agent...</i>

00:14:08.276 --> 00:14:09.796
<i>linked to numerous
acts of terrorism</i>

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.316
<i>and political assassinations.</i>

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:12.996
I have to go to work.

00:14:33.354 --> 00:14:34.354
Hello?

00:14:36.194 --> 00:14:38.234
Is this your car out front?

00:14:39.874 --> 00:14:41.674
I jumped the curb.

00:14:43.354 --> 00:14:44.314
Maybe we could...

00:14:44.874 --> 00:14:46.434
take care of it ourselves.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.594
If you wanna call the
cops, that's okay, too...

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.234
- I guess.
- No.

00:14:51.874 --> 00:14:53.674
No cops.

00:14:53.914 --> 00:14:54.914
Thank you.

00:15:32.994 --> 00:15:34.634
You have kept
your looks, Colonel.

00:15:35.394 --> 00:15:36.394
Congratulations.

00:15:40.394 --> 00:15:44.394
"Mission report.
December 16, 1991."

00:15:44.554 --> 00:15:45.994
Who are you?

00:15:47.234 --> 00:15:49.074
My name is Zemo.

00:15:50.234 --> 00:15:52.434
I will repeat my question.

00:15:53.074 --> 00:15:57.954
Mission report,
December 16, 1991.

00:15:58.114 --> 00:15:59.914
How did you find me?

00:16:00.074 --> 00:16:01.994
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...

00:16:02.154 --> 00:16:05.674
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.

00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:08.514
Millions of pages.
Much of it encrypted.

00:16:08.594 --> 00:16:10.314
Not easy to decipher.

00:16:13.634 --> 00:16:15.514
But, I have experience.

00:16:16.354 --> 00:16:17.994
And patience.

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.474
A man can do
anything if he has those.

00:16:22.514 --> 00:16:23.754
What do you want?

00:16:24.954 --> 00:16:26.794
Mission report.

00:16:26.994 --> 00:16:28.794
December 16.

00:16:28.994 --> 00:16:30.514
1991.

00:16:31.154 --> 00:16:34.514
Go... to... hell!

00:16:48.714 --> 00:16:51.114
HYDRA deserves its
place on the ash heap.

00:16:51.714 --> 00:16:54.154
So your death
would not bother me.

00:16:54.794 --> 00:16:56.714
But I'd have to use this book...

00:16:57.234 --> 00:17:00.394
and other bloodier
methods to find what I need.

00:17:00.554 --> 00:17:02.754
I don't look forward to that.

00:17:04.394 --> 00:17:06.554
You'd only be dying for...

00:17:06.714 --> 00:17:08.194
your pride.

00:17:22.914 --> 00:17:25.394
Hail HYDRA.

00:17:44.162 --> 00:17:47.602
I swear.
I don't know where they went! I swear.

00:17:48.682 --> 00:17:49.962
If he knew where
they were headed,

00:17:50.042 --> 00:17:51.162
he would have already told us.

00:17:51.242 --> 00:17:52.242
Yeah.

00:17:52.722 --> 00:17:53.722
Ronan,

00:17:54.042 --> 00:17:57.082
the Nova Corps sent a
fleet to defend the prison.

00:17:57.162 --> 00:17:58.162
Well, then,

00:17:58.282 --> 00:18:01.402
send Necrocraft to every
corner of the quadrant.

00:18:01.562 --> 00:18:05.082
Find the Orb.
Any means, any price.

00:18:05.202 --> 00:18:06.562
And this place?

00:18:06.682 --> 00:18:08.202
The Nova can't
know what we're after.

00:18:09.682 --> 00:18:11.562
Cleanse it!

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:22.378
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:18:22.458 --> 00:18:23.778
Yo, Ranger Rick!
What are you doing?

00:18:23.938 --> 00:18:26.538
You can't take apart my
ship without asking me!

00:18:26.698 --> 00:18:28.538
- See, what is this?
- Don't touch that!

00:18:28.618 --> 00:18:29.618
It's a bomb.

00:18:29.698 --> 00:18:30.738
- A bomb?
- Yup.

00:18:30.858 --> 00:18:32.538
And you leave it lying around?

00:18:32.658 --> 00:18:34.298
I was gonna put it in a box.

00:18:34.418 --> 00:18:35.458
What's a box gonna do?

00:18:35.618 --> 00:18:37.738
- How about this one?
- No! Whoa. Hey!

00:18:37.858 --> 00:18:38.818
- Leave it alone.
- Why? What is it?

00:18:38.898 --> 00:18:40.498
- Shut up.
- Hey!

00:18:41.738 --> 00:18:42.778
What is that?

00:18:42.898 --> 00:18:45.698
That's for if things
get really hardcore.

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:47.458
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

00:18:47.538 --> 00:18:48.898
No one's blowing up moons.

00:18:49.058 --> 00:18:51.338
You just wanna suck
the joy out of everything.

00:18:51.458 --> 00:18:53.538
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

00:18:53.938 --> 00:18:56.778
We're heading in the right direction.
For now.

00:18:56.858 --> 00:18:59.418
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

00:18:59.578 --> 00:19:00.898
And how much do you trust me?

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:04.058
I'd trust you a lot more if
you told me what this was.

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:07.938
Because I'm guessing
it's some kind of weapon.

00:19:08.058 --> 00:19:09.458
I don't know what it is.

00:19:09.538 --> 00:19:11.778
If it's a weapon, we
should use it against Ronan.

00:19:11.938 --> 00:19:13.858
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

00:19:13.938 --> 00:19:14.938
Or just you, murderess!

00:19:15.098 --> 00:19:16.778
I let you live once, princess!

00:19:16.898 --> 00:19:18.938
- I am not a princess!
- Hey!

00:19:19.058 --> 00:19:22.698
Nobody is killing
anybody on my ship!

00:19:23.458 --> 00:19:26.898
We're stuck together
until we get the money.

00:19:27.018 --> 00:19:29.098
I have no interest in money.

00:19:29.458 --> 00:19:30.658
Great.

00:19:31.898 --> 00:19:34.938
That means more
money for the three of us.

00:19:36.098 --> 00:19:37.138
Mmm?

00:19:37.698 --> 00:19:39.458
For the four of us.

00:19:39.738 --> 00:19:40.858
Partners.

00:19:40.938 --> 00:19:42.578
We have an agreement,

00:19:42.658 --> 00:19:44.138
but I would never be
partners with the likes of you.

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:46.778
I'll tell the buyer
we're on our way.

00:19:47.858 --> 00:19:51.058
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:57.378
Oh, she has no idea.

00:19:57.858 --> 00:19:59.858
If I had a black light,

00:19:59.938 --> 00:20:02.498
the place would look like
a Jackson Pollock painting.

00:20:03.018 --> 00:20:04.818
You got issues, Quill.

00:20:07.429 --> 00:20:09.429
Do you got any other cute
little buggers like this one?

00:20:10.069 --> 00:20:13.549
I like to stick 'em all in a
row on my control console.

00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:16.149
I can't tell if you're
joking or not.

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:18.349
He's being fully serious.

00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:20.669
In that case, I can show you...

00:20:21.349 --> 00:20:23.629
But first, you gonna
tell me what this Orb is,

00:20:23.709 --> 00:20:26.069
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

00:20:26.509 --> 00:20:28.349
And then you gonna tell me,

00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:30.549
who out there
might wanna buy it.

00:20:30.709 --> 00:20:33.389
Sir, the high-end
community is a...

00:20:36.349 --> 00:20:38.429
The high-end community is a...

00:20:38.509 --> 00:20:40.029
It's a tight-knit...

00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:41.309
Tight-knit...

00:20:41.429 --> 00:20:43.229
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

00:20:44.429 --> 00:20:45.709
I cannot possibly betray

00:20:46.389 --> 00:20:48.149
the confidentiality
of my buyers!

00:20:59.269 --> 00:21:01.549
Now, who again is
this buyer of yours?

00:21:05.269 --> 00:21:06.589
Carina.

00:21:06.709 --> 00:21:07.989
Yes, Master.

00:21:08.069 --> 00:21:11.069
Your people do have
elbows, do they not?

00:21:11.469 --> 00:21:12.989
We do, Master.

00:21:13.109 --> 00:21:16.069
Then use them.

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:18.669
I don't have to remind you

00:21:18.749 --> 00:21:21.749
what happened to the last
attendant who disappointed me.

00:21:22.429 --> 00:21:23.749
Do I?

00:21:26.429 --> 00:21:30.589
Chop, chop.
Our guests will be here soon.

00:21:59.079 --> 00:22:00.079
No.

00:22:00.399 --> 00:22:02.839
Give your body time to heal.

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:06.239
You've ruined me.

00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:08.759
How long until I can take...

00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:09.839
Doctor Strange.

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:11.639
Those tissues are still healing.

00:22:11.719 --> 00:22:12.759
So, speed it up.

00:22:12.959 --> 00:22:15.599
Pass a stent down the brachial
artery into the radial artery.

00:22:16.679 --> 00:22:17.679
It's possible.

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:21.719
Experimental and
expensive, but possible.

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:23.719
All I need is possible.

00:22:47.279 --> 00:22:48.279
<i>Up.</i>

00:22:49.759 --> 00:22:50.759
Up.

00:22:51.359 --> 00:22:53.239
Show me your strength.

00:22:58.679 --> 00:22:59.999
This is useless.

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:03.319
It's not useless, man.
You can do this.

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:06.799
All right, answer me
this, bachelor's degree.

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:09.559
Have you ever known
anyone with nerve damage

00:23:09.639 --> 00:23:11.199
this severe to do this...

00:23:11.399 --> 00:23:12.559
and actually recover?

00:23:12.639 --> 00:23:14.199
One guy, yeah.

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:16.719
Factory accident,
broke his back...

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:19.199
paralyzed, his leg wasted away.

00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:20.559
He had pain in his shoulder,

00:23:20.639 --> 00:23:21.639
from the wheelchair.

00:23:21.959 --> 00:23:24.279
He came in three times a week.

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:25.599
Then one day he stopped coming.

00:23:25.839 --> 00:23:27.599
I thought he was dead.

00:23:27.719 --> 00:23:29.839
A few years later, he
walked past me on the street.

00:23:30.079 --> 00:23:31.399
- Walked?
- Yeah, walked.

00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:34.359
Bullshit. Show me his file.

00:23:34.719 --> 00:23:37.159
It'll take me a while to pull
the files from the archive.

00:23:37.239 --> 00:23:39.679
But if it proves your
arrogant ass wrong...

00:23:40.199 --> 00:23:41.399
Worth it.

00:23:56.399 --> 00:23:58.359
<i>I looked at all your research...</i>

00:23:58.439 --> 00:24:00.639
<i>I read all the
papers you've sent.</i>

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:02.519
<i>It's not gonna work.</i>

00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:04.119
<i>I don't think you realize...</i>

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:06.799
<i>- how severe the damages are.</i>
- Here's the thing...

00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:07.919
<i>The best have tried and failed.</i>

00:24:08.399 --> 00:24:10.879
I understand. Here's the thing.

00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:13.079
<i>What you want from me
is impossible, Stephen.</i>

00:24:13.439 --> 00:24:14.479
Come on.

00:24:14.639 --> 00:24:16.239
<i>I've got my own
reputation to consider.</i>

00:24:16.399 --> 00:24:18.159
- Etienne, wait. No.
<i>- I can't help you.</i>

00:24:18.399 --> 00:24:19.519
No, no, wait!

00:24:25.719 --> 00:24:26.719
Hey!

00:24:33.159 --> 00:24:34.679
He won't do it.

00:24:37.439 --> 00:24:38.639
He's a hack.

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:41.279
There is a new
procedure in Tokyo.

00:24:41.399 --> 00:24:42.879
They culture donor stem cells...

00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:44.199
and then harvesting them

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:45.759
and then 3D printing a scaffold.

00:24:45.839 --> 00:24:46.919
If I could get a
loan together...

00:24:47.079 --> 00:24:48.079
Stephen.

00:24:48.239 --> 00:24:49.799
A small loan, just $200,000.

00:24:49.999 --> 00:24:51.959
You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it...

00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:54.079
but now you're spending
money you don't even have.

00:24:54.479 --> 00:24:56.879
Maybe it's time to
consider stopping.

00:24:57.639 --> 00:25:00.279
No, now is exactly
the time not to stop...

00:25:00.479 --> 00:25:03.159
because, you see, I'm
not getting any better!

00:25:03.479 --> 00:25:05.159
But this isn't medicine anymore.

00:25:05.439 --> 00:25:06.999
This is mania.

00:25:07.879 --> 00:25:09.759
Some things just can't be fixed.

00:25:09.959 --> 00:25:12.399
- Life without my work...
- Is still life.

00:25:12.639 --> 00:25:13.599
This isn't the end.

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:16.559
There are other things that
can give your life meaning.

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:18.439
Like what? Like you?

00:25:20.879 --> 00:25:23.159
This is the part
where you apologize.

00:25:23.439 --> 00:25:25.159
This is the part
where you leave.

00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:28.719
Fine, I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

00:25:28.999 --> 00:25:29.999
Oh, too difficult
for you, is it?

00:25:30.479 --> 00:25:32.359
Yes, it is.

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:34.719
It breaks my heart
to see you this way.

00:25:34.959 --> 00:25:36.959
- No, don't pity me.
- I'm not pitying you.

00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:38.279
Oh, yeah?
Then what are you doing here...

00:25:38.479 --> 00:25:40.639
bringing cheese and wine like
we're old friends going for a picnic?

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:41.999
We are not friends, Christine.

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:43.479
We were barely lovers.

00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:45.359
But you just love a
sob story, don't you?

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:46.839
Is that what I am to you now?

00:25:46.959 --> 00:25:49.599
"Poor Stephen
Strange, charity case."

00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:50.799
"He finally needs me."

00:25:50.879 --> 00:25:52.599
Another dreg of humanity
for you to work on.

00:25:52.679 --> 00:25:55.039
Patch him up and send
him back into the world...

00:25:55.159 --> 00:25:56.599
heart's just humming.

00:25:56.679 --> 00:26:00.079
You care so much, don't you?

00:26:04.319 --> 00:26:05.559
Goodbye, Stephen.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.580
Call MI6, see if we can get

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.180
Micro Forensics
to hurry this up.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.580
We need the whole
team here in two hours

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.780
or it's not worth it.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.380
I'm very sorry.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.740
In my culture...

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.940
death is not the end.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.740
It's more of a
stepping-off point.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.340
You reach out with both hands...

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.660
and Bast and Sekhmet,

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.380
they lead you into
the green veldt...

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.100
where you can run forever.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.100
That sounds very peaceful.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.740
My father thought so.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.420
I am not my father.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.100
T'Challa...

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.060
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.420
Don't bother, Ms. Romanoff.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.020
I'll kill him myself.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.420
Yeah?

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.740
You all right?

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.740
<i>Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.</i>

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:29.140
I know how much Barnes means to you.
I really do.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.340
Stay home.
You'll only make this worse.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.860
<i>For all of us.</i>

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.020
<i>Please.</i>

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.180
Are you saying you'll arrest me?

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.820
No.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:40.980
Someone will.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.460
<i>If you interfere.
That's how it works now.</i>

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.060
If he's this far gone, Nat,

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.660
I should be the
one to bring him in.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.820
<i>Why?</i>

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.700
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.540
Shit.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.860
She tell you to stay out of it?

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.620
Might have a point.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.980
He'd do it for me.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.620
1945, maybe.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.500
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.060
The people that shoot at you

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.860
usually wind up shooting at me.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.460
Tips have been pouring in

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.980
since that footage went public.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.020
Everybody thinks the Winter
Soldier goes to their gym.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.980
Most of it's noise.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.500
Except for this.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.740
My boss expects a
briefing, pretty much now...

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.020
so that's all the head
start you're gonna get.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.180
Thank you.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.020
You're gonna have to hurry.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.700
We have orders
to shoot on sight.

00:30:34.272 --> 00:30:36.952
Heads up! We're inbound.

00:30:52.352 --> 00:30:53.512
Whoa.

00:30:56.272 --> 00:30:57.312
What is it?

00:30:58.352 --> 00:31:00.312
<i>It's called Knowhere.</i>

00:31:00.392 --> 00:31:03.352
<i>The severed head of
an ancient celestial being.</i>

00:31:03.872 --> 00:31:05.512
Be wary headed in, rodent.

00:31:06.632 --> 00:31:09.952
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

00:31:34.272 --> 00:31:37.152
Hundreds of years ago, the
Tivan Group sent workers in

00:31:37.232 --> 00:31:39.912
to mine the organic
matter within the skull.

00:31:39.992 --> 00:31:42.192
Bone, brain
tissue, spinal fluid.

00:31:42.312 --> 00:31:47.192
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:51.152
It's dangerous and illegal
work, suitable only for outlaws.

00:31:51.272 --> 00:31:53.032
Well, I come from
a planet of outlaws.

00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:54.632
Billy the Kid,

00:31:54.992 --> 00:31:56.952
Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.

00:31:57.072 --> 00:31:58.432
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

00:31:58.512 --> 00:31:59.552
Yeah, you should.

00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:02.152
Excuse me.

00:32:02.232 --> 00:32:04.512
- Watch your wallets.
- Can you spare any units?

00:32:12.072 --> 00:32:13.592
Get out of here.

00:32:18.712 --> 00:32:20.952
Your buyer's in there?

00:32:21.352 --> 00:32:23.232
We are to wait here
for his representative.

00:32:23.352 --> 00:32:24.712
Get out of here!

00:32:25.032 --> 00:32:27.192
This is no respectable
establishment.

00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:29.352
What do you expect
us to do while we wait?

00:32:31.192 --> 00:32:32.272
Yes! Yes!

00:32:33.072 --> 00:32:34.192
Whoa!

00:32:41.272 --> 00:32:42.592
Yahoo!

00:32:49.552 --> 00:32:51.392
My Orloni has won,

00:32:51.592 --> 00:32:53.392
as I won at all things!

00:32:54.112 --> 00:32:56.672
Now, let's put more of
this liquid into our bodies.

00:32:56.992 --> 00:33:00.752
That's the first thing you
said that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

00:33:02.085 --> 00:33:03.645
All the way. Here we go.

00:33:03.965 --> 00:33:05.925
Let's go! All day! All day!

00:33:06.005 --> 00:33:09.005
Yeah! All day.

00:33:09.245 --> 00:33:10.365
Come on, man!
Where's the competition?

00:33:13.485 --> 00:33:14.805
Talk a lot.

00:33:15.885 --> 00:33:17.085
Jonathan Pangborn...

00:33:17.325 --> 00:33:20.245
C7-C8 spinal cord
injury, complete.

00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:21.965
Who are you?

00:33:22.045 --> 00:33:23.045
Paralyzed from
the mid-chest down.

00:33:23.285 --> 00:33:24.845
Partial paralysis in both hands.

00:33:25.085 --> 00:33:27.005
- I don't know you.
- I'm Stephen Strange.

00:33:27.245 --> 00:33:30.165
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Was a neurosurgeon.

00:33:31.245 --> 00:33:33.925
Actually, you know
what, man, I do know you.

00:33:34.085 --> 00:33:36.805
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

00:33:36.965 --> 00:33:38.405
I never got past your assistant.

00:33:40.205 --> 00:33:41.565
You were untreatable.

00:33:42.005 --> 00:33:44.045
No glory for you in that, right?

00:33:46.045 --> 00:33:48.325
You came back from a place
there's no way back from.

00:33:52.725 --> 00:33:55.005
I'm trying to find
my own way back.

00:33:57.885 --> 00:34:00.005
Pangborn, are you in or you out?

00:34:07.205 --> 00:34:08.605
All right.

00:34:10.725 --> 00:34:12.885
I'd given up on my body.

00:34:13.365 --> 00:34:15.205
I thought my mind's the
only thing I have left...

00:34:15.365 --> 00:34:17.285
I should at least
try to elevate that.

00:34:17.925 --> 00:34:19.885
So, I sat with gurus...

00:34:20.045 --> 00:34:21.725
and sacred women.

00:34:21.885 --> 00:34:24.725
Strangers carried me to
mountaintops to see holy men.

00:34:24.885 --> 00:34:25.925
And finally...

00:34:26.205 --> 00:34:28.725
I found my teacher.

00:34:28.885 --> 00:34:31.405
And my mind was elevated...

00:34:31.565 --> 00:34:32.765
and my spirit deepened.

00:34:33.725 --> 00:34:34.725
And somehow...

00:34:34.885 --> 00:34:35.885
Your body healed.

00:34:36.085 --> 00:34:37.085
Yes.

00:34:38.725 --> 00:34:40.725
There were deeper
secrets to learn there...

00:34:40.925 --> 00:34:42.405
but I didn't have the
strength to receive them.

00:34:42.765 --> 00:34:45.525
I chose to settle for my
miracle and I came back home.

00:34:50.925 --> 00:34:54.005
The place you're looking
for is called Kamar-Taj.

00:34:54.165 --> 00:34:55.405
But the cost there is high.

00:34:55.645 --> 00:34:57.405
How much?

00:34:57.525 --> 00:34:59.165
I'm not talking about money.

00:35:01.245 --> 00:35:02.605
Good luck.

00:35:04.525 --> 00:35:06.925
Let's ball. All right, ball up!

00:35:27.845 --> 00:35:29.125
Uh, Kamar-Taj?

00:35:29.405 --> 00:35:31.925
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

00:35:55.765 --> 00:35:57.325
Kamar-Taj?

00:35:58.365 --> 00:36:00.205
Kamar-Taj.

00:36:28.525 --> 00:36:29.765
Okay.

00:36:32.365 --> 00:36:34.405
Look, guys, I don't
have any money.

00:36:35.085 --> 00:36:36.165
Your watch.

00:36:36.445 --> 00:36:39.445
No, please.
It's all I have left.

00:36:39.605 --> 00:36:40.645
Your watch.

00:36:44.045 --> 00:36:45.245
All right.

00:37:25.565 --> 00:37:27.605
You're looking for Kamar-Taj.

00:37:36.107 --> 00:37:37.987
Man, you wouldn't believe
what they charge for fuel out here.

00:37:38.067 --> 00:37:40.267
I might actually lose
money on this job.

00:37:40.387 --> 00:37:42.107
My connection is making us wait.

00:37:42.667 --> 00:37:46.427
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

00:37:46.787 --> 00:37:48.707
Where yours is more,

00:37:48.907 --> 00:37:51.707
"Stab, stab.
Those are my terms."

00:37:52.907 --> 00:37:54.267
My father didn't
stress diplomacy.

00:37:54.387 --> 00:37:55.467
Thanos?

00:37:57.267 --> 00:37:58.747
He's not my father.

00:37:59.947 --> 00:38:01.227
When Thanos took my home world,

00:38:01.387 --> 00:38:03.787
he killed my parents
in front of me.

00:38:04.787 --> 00:38:06.107
He tortured me,

00:38:06.267 --> 00:38:08.787
turned me into a weapon.

00:38:09.187 --> 00:38:13.187
When he said he was going to
destroy an entire planet for Ronan,

00:38:13.307 --> 00:38:15.307
I couldn't stand by and...

00:38:20.187 --> 00:38:22.187
Why would you
risk your life for this?

00:38:24.267 --> 00:38:25.947
My mother gave it to me.

00:38:27.947 --> 00:38:30.747
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

00:38:30.827 --> 00:38:31.827
I happened to have it on me,

00:38:32.187 --> 00:38:34.067
when I was...

00:38:34.867 --> 00:38:36.747
The day that she...

00:38:39.067 --> 00:38:40.867
You know, when I left Earth.

00:38:41.827 --> 00:38:42.987
What do you do with it?

00:38:43.107 --> 00:38:46.827
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

00:38:46.987 --> 00:38:51.507
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

00:38:51.827 --> 00:38:52.947
Really?

00:38:53.067 --> 00:38:57.227
On my planet, there's a
legend about people like you.

00:38:57.347 --> 00:38:58.787
It's called

00:38:59.067 --> 00:39:00.227
<i>Footloose.</i>

00:39:00.347 --> 00:39:04.347
And in it, a great hero

00:39:04.507 --> 00:39:05.947
named Kevin Bacon,

00:39:06.867 --> 00:39:11.387
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

00:39:12.787 --> 00:39:14.507
It's the greatest
thing there is.

00:39:15.347 --> 00:39:17.027
Who put the sticks
up their butts?

00:39:17.187 --> 00:39:18.547
What? No, that's just a...

00:39:18.867 --> 00:39:20.507
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

00:39:20.827 --> 00:39:22.987
people use.

00:39:41.387 --> 00:39:43.547
The melody is pleasant!

00:40:00.827 --> 00:40:02.947
- No!
- Ow! What the hell?

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.347
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

00:40:04.507 --> 00:40:07.867
And I am not some starry-eyed
waif here to succumb to your...

00:40:08.027 --> 00:40:10.107
Your pelvic sorcery!

00:40:10.267 --> 00:40:11.587
That is not what
is happening here.

00:40:16.827 --> 00:40:18.547
Oh, no.

00:40:27.947 --> 00:40:29.187
Stop it!

00:40:29.507 --> 00:40:30.507
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

00:40:31.067 --> 00:40:34.107
This vermin speaks of
affairs he knows nothing about!

00:40:34.267 --> 00:40:36.187
- That is true!
- He has no respect!

00:40:36.307 --> 00:40:38.627
- That is also true!
- Hold on! Hold on!

00:40:38.947 --> 00:40:40.947
Keep calling me
vermin, tough guy!

00:40:41.107 --> 00:40:43.107
You just wanna laugh
at me like everyone else!

00:40:43.267 --> 00:40:45.907
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

00:40:46.027 --> 00:40:48.627
He thinks I'm some stupid thing!
He does!

00:40:48.947 --> 00:40:50.947
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

00:40:51.347 --> 00:40:53.347
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

00:40:53.467 --> 00:40:55.427
and put back
together, over and over

00:40:55.547 --> 00:40:57.627
and turned into some...

00:40:58.027 --> 00:40:59.067
Some little monster!

00:40:59.187 --> 00:41:01.107
Rocket, no one's
calling you a monster.

00:41:01.227 --> 00:41:03.307
He called me "vermin"!

00:41:03.467 --> 00:41:06.147
She called me "rodent"!

00:41:06.267 --> 00:41:07.547
Let's see if you can laugh

00:41:07.627 --> 00:41:10.627
after five or six good
shots to your frickin' face!

00:41:10.987 --> 00:41:12.307
No, no, no, no!

00:41:12.467 --> 00:41:14.587
Four billion units! Rocket!

00:41:14.947 --> 00:41:15.907
Come on, man. Hey!

00:41:15.987 --> 00:41:16.987
Suck it up for one
more lousy night

00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:18.587
and you're rich.

00:41:27.307 --> 00:41:28.507
Fine.

00:41:29.107 --> 00:41:30.467
But I can't promise,
when all this is over

00:41:30.587 --> 00:41:32.267
I'm not gonna kill every
last one of you jerks.

00:41:32.387 --> 00:41:35.987
See? That's exactly why
none of you have any friends!

00:41:36.507 --> 00:41:39.187
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

00:41:39.267 --> 00:41:43.227
We have travelled,
halfway across the quadrant.

00:41:43.347 --> 00:41:45.347
And Ronan is no
closer to being dead.

00:41:47.667 --> 00:41:49.667
- Drax!
- Let him go.

00:41:50.027 --> 00:41:51.187
We don't need him.

00:41:53.707 --> 00:41:55.507
Milady Gamora.

00:41:55.707 --> 00:41:57.507
I'm here to fetch
you for my master.

00:42:03.987 --> 00:42:05.707
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

00:42:06.267 --> 00:42:09.147
We house the galaxy's
largest collection

00:42:09.707 --> 00:42:12.267
of fauna, relics, and
species of all manner.

00:42:19.027 --> 00:42:20.187
I present to you,

00:42:20.547 --> 00:42:24.307
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Really?

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.080
Sure we got the right place?

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.320
That one looks a little
more Kamar-Tajey.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.880
I once stood in your place.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.480
And I, too, was disrespectful.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.840
So, might I offer
you some advice?

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.240
Forget everything
you think you know.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.240
All right.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.840
The sanctuary of our teacher.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
The Ancient One.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.000
The Ancient One?

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.160
What's his real name?

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.920
Right.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.560
Forget everything I think I know.
Sorry.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.080
Um, thank you for... Whoa!

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.440
Okay, that's a thing.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.680
Thank you for...

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.920
Hello.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.280
Oh, thank you.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.240
And thank you.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.360
Uh, thank you...

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.200
Ancient One, for seeing me.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.360
You're very welcome.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.120
The Ancient One.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.120
Thank you, Master Mordo.
Thank you, Master Hamir.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.880
Mr. Strange.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.120
Uh... Doctor, actually.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.760
Well, no, not anymore, surely.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.000
Isn't that why you're here?

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.560
You've undergone
many procedures.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.000
- Seven, right?
- Yeah.

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.760
It's good tea.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.040
Yes.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.080
Did you heal a man
named Pangborn?

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.320
A paralyzed man?

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.480
In a way.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.560
You helped him to walk again.

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.720
Yes.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.480
How did you correct a complete
C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.400
Well, I didn't correct it.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.920
He couldn't walk.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.400
I convinced him that he could.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.480
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.560
When you reattach
a severed nerve...

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.080
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.160
It's the cells.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.840
The cells are only programmed...

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.960
to put themselves back
together in very specific ways.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.040
Right.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.640
What if I told you that your
own body could be convinced...

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.960
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.120
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.480
That's bleeding
edge medical tech.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.440
Is that why you're working here?

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.840
Without a governing
medical board?

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.920
Just how experimental
is your treatment?

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.960
Quite.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.800
So, you've figured out a way...

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.160
to reprogram nerve
cells to self-heal?

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.720
No, Mr. Strange.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.200
I know how to
reorient the spirit...

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.000
to better heal the body.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.520
- The spirit to heal the body?
- That's right.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.640
No. All right.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.800
How do we do that?

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.480
Where do we start?

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.000
- Don't like that map?
- Oh, no.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.240
It's really good.
It's just, I've seen it before...

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.600
in gift shops.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.720
And what about this one?

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.320
- Acupuncture, great.
- Yeah?

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.480
What about that one?

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.360
Showing me an MRI scan.
I do not believe this.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.040
Each of those maps was
drawn up by someone...

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.840
who could see in
part, but not the whole.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.320
I spent my last dollar
getting here, one-way ticket...

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.640
and you're talking to me
about healing through belief?

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.160
You're a man looking at
the world through a keyhole.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.760
You've spent your whole life

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.200
trying to widen that keyhole...

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.880
to see more, to know more.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.040
Now, on hearing that
it can be widened...

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.080
in ways you can't imagine...

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.680
you reject the possibility.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.320
No, I reject it because I
do not believe in fairy tales...

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.040
about chakras or energy...

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.800
or the power of belief.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.000
There is no such
thing as spirit!

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.600
We are made of matter
and nothing more.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.960
You're just another
tiny, momentary speck

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.360
within an indifferent universe.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.080
You think too
little of yourself.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.280
Oh, you think you see
through me, do you?

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.440
Well, you don't.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.360
But I see through you!

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.520
What did you just do to me?

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.760
I pushed your astral form
out of your physical form.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.480
What's in that tea?

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.240
Psilocybin? LSD?

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.080
It's just tea...

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.200
with a little honey.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.000
What just happened?

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.480
For a moment, you
entered the astral dimension.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.560
The what?

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.720
A place where the soul
exists apart from the body.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.720
Why are you doing this to me?

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.240
To show you just how
much you don't know.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.440
Open your eye.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.760
Oh, shit!

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.280
Oh, God! Oh, God, no!

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.840
No, no, no!

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
What's happening?

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.280
This isn't real!

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.800
<i>His heart rate is
getting dangerously high.</i>

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.160
He looks all right to me.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.520
<i>You think you know
how the world works?</i>

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.880
<i>You think that this material
universe is all there is?</i>

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.640
<i>What is real?</i>

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.400
<i>What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?</i>

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.880
<i>At the root of existence...</i>

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.160
<i>mind and matter meet.</i>

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.200
<i>Thoughts shape reality.</i>

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.560
Oh!

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.800
<i>This universe is only
one of an infinite number.</i>

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.520
<i>Worlds without end.</i>

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.760
<i>Some benevolent and life giving.</i>

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.360
<i>Others filled with
malice and hunger.</i>

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.280
<i>Dark places...</i>

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:38.240
<i>where powers older
than time lie ravenous...</i>

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.160
<i>and waiting.</i>

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:55.000
<i>Who are you in this vast
Multiverse, Mr. Strange?</i>

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:18.200
Have you seen that
before in a gift shop?

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.400
Teach me.

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.160
No.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.000
No.

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.080
No!

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.240
No, no, no!

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.520
No!

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.920
Open the door! Please!

00:50:58.663 --> 00:51:00.743
Oh, my dear Gamora.

00:51:01.583 --> 00:51:03.903
How wonderful to
meet in the flesh.

00:51:04.063 --> 00:51:06.703
Let's bypass the
formalities, Tivan.

00:51:07.103 --> 00:51:09.663
We have what we discussed.

00:51:10.583 --> 00:51:15.103
What is that thing there?

00:51:15.223 --> 00:51:16.983
I am Groot.

00:51:21.063 --> 00:51:22.783
I never thought
I'd meet a Groot.

00:51:22.903 --> 00:51:24.263
Sir...

00:51:25.023 --> 00:51:28.223
You must allow me to pay you
now so that I may own your carcass.

00:51:28.583 --> 00:51:31.263
At the moment of
your death, of course.

00:51:31.623 --> 00:51:32.783
I am Groot.

00:51:32.903 --> 00:51:35.703
Why, so he could turn
you into a frickin' chair?

00:51:35.783 --> 00:51:36.783
That's your pet?

00:51:38.063 --> 00:51:39.783
- His what?
- Tivan.

00:51:40.303 --> 00:51:44.063
We have been halfway around
the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

00:51:44.223 --> 00:51:46.263
Very well, then.

00:51:46.583 --> 00:51:48.943
Let us see what you brought.

00:52:02.743 --> 00:52:05.303
Three quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

00:52:05.663 --> 00:52:08.903
No, cases.
Last time, you sent me...

00:52:08.983 --> 00:52:10.063
Uh...

00:52:10.623 --> 00:52:13.303
You shall send a message for me.

00:52:13.863 --> 00:52:15.223
Oh, my new friends.

00:52:16.703 --> 00:52:19.823
Before creation itself,

00:52:19.943 --> 00:52:21.703
there were six singularities.

00:52:23.903 --> 00:52:27.663
Then the universe
exploded into existence,

00:52:27.823 --> 00:52:29.823
and the remnants
of these systems

00:52:29.983 --> 00:52:33.343
were forged into
concentrated ingots.

00:52:34.143 --> 00:52:36.343
Infinity Stones.

00:52:37.663 --> 00:52:39.063
These stones, it seems,

00:52:39.183 --> 00:52:41.063
can only be brandished

00:52:41.183 --> 00:52:44.783
by beings of
extraordinary strength.

00:52:44.903 --> 00:52:45.943
Observe.

00:52:49.103 --> 00:52:54.943
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

00:52:55.023 --> 00:52:58.663
like wheat in a field.

00:53:00.023 --> 00:53:02.223
There's a little pee
coming out of me right now.

00:53:03.063 --> 00:53:04.303
Once, for a moment,

00:53:04.623 --> 00:53:08.663
a group was able to share the
energy amongst themselves,

00:53:08.783 --> 00:53:11.743
but even they were
quickly destroyed by it.

00:53:17.903 --> 00:53:19.663
Beautiful.

00:53:21.303 --> 00:53:23.863
Beyond compare.

00:53:23.943 --> 00:53:25.943
Blah, blah, blah.

00:53:26.023 --> 00:53:29.743
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

00:53:31.703 --> 00:53:32.983
How would you like to get paid?

00:53:33.103 --> 00:53:35.143
What do you think, fancy man?
Units!

00:53:36.743 --> 00:53:37.783
Very well, then.

00:53:43.263 --> 00:53:44.743
Carina.

00:53:45.023 --> 00:53:46.023
Stand back.

00:53:46.743 --> 00:53:49.263
I will no longer be your slave!

00:53:49.423 --> 00:53:50.943
No!

00:54:38.223 --> 00:54:39.303
What the...

00:54:45.078 --> 00:54:47.278
Thank you, Masters.

00:54:51.158 --> 00:54:53.758
You think I was
wrong to cast him out?

00:54:53.918 --> 00:54:56.198
5 hours later, he's
still on your doorstep.

00:54:57.398 --> 00:54:58.998
There's a strength to him.

00:54:59.158 --> 00:55:01.798
Stubbornness,
arrogance, ambition.

00:55:01.878 --> 00:55:03.518
I've seen it all before.

00:55:04.598 --> 00:55:06.758
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

00:55:06.838 --> 00:55:09.678
I cannot lead another
gifted student to power...

00:55:09.758 --> 00:55:11.998
only to lose him
to the darkness.

00:55:13.958 --> 00:55:15.438
You didn't lose me.

00:55:16.278 --> 00:55:18.158
I wanted the power
to defeat my enemies.

00:55:18.238 --> 00:55:21.838
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

00:55:21.998 --> 00:55:24.878
And to live within
the natural law.

00:55:25.158 --> 00:55:28.198
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

00:55:28.278 --> 00:55:30.318
We only learn to
live above them.

00:55:32.918 --> 00:55:35.758
Kaecilius still has
the stolen pages.

00:55:35.958 --> 00:55:38.238
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin...

00:55:38.318 --> 00:55:39.758
upon us all.

00:55:40.878 --> 00:55:42.558
There may be dark days ahead.

00:55:43.278 --> 00:55:46.478
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could
use a man like Strange.

00:55:56.398 --> 00:55:58.398
Don't shut me out.

00:56:01.278 --> 00:56:04.278
I haven't got
anywhere else to go.

00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:09.198
Thank you.

00:56:14.518 --> 00:56:15.558
Bathe.

00:56:16.678 --> 00:56:17.918
Rest.

00:56:18.878 --> 00:56:20.238
Meditate...

00:56:20.398 --> 00:56:22.238
if you can.

00:56:22.398 --> 00:56:24.438
The Ancient One
will send for you.

00:56:31.838 --> 00:56:33.558
What's this? My mantra?

00:56:36.158 --> 00:56:37.838
The Wi-Fi password.

00:56:38.998 --> 00:56:41.078
We're not savages.

00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:38.629
<i>Heads up, Cap.</i>

00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:41.109
<i>German Special Forces,
approaching from the south.</i>

00:58:41.869 --> 00:58:43.109
Understood.

00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:53.069
Do you know me?

00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:57.469
You're Steve.

00:58:58.389 --> 00:59:00.669
I read about you in a museum.

00:59:01.149 --> 00:59:02.909
<i>They've set the perimeter.</i>

00:59:03.909 --> 00:59:05.469
I know you're nervous,

00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:07.229
and you have plenty
of reason to be.

00:59:08.989 --> 00:59:10.669
But you're lying.

00:59:11.749 --> 00:59:13.749
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that anymore.

00:59:13.909 --> 00:59:15.069
<i>They're entering the building.</i>

00:59:15.269 --> 00:59:17.669
Well, the people who think
you did are coming here now.

00:59:17.749 --> 00:59:19.589
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.

00:59:19.749 --> 00:59:21.269
That's smart.

00:59:21.429 --> 00:59:22.589
Good strategy.

00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:25.629
<i>They're on the roof.
I'm compromised.</i>

00:59:28.949 --> 00:59:30.589
This doesn't have to
end in a fight, Buck.

00:59:35.629 --> 00:59:37.629
It always ends in a fight.
<i>Five seconds.</i>

00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:40.269
You pulled me from the river.

00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:41.789
Why?

00:59:42.669 --> 00:59:44.429
I don't know. <i>Three seconds.</i>

00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:46.309
Yes, you do.

00:59:47.629 --> 00:59:48.709
<i>Breach! Breach! Breach!</i>

01:00:09.149 --> 01:00:10.229
Buck, stop!

01:00:10.829 --> 01:00:12.069
You're gonna kill someone.

01:00:14.749 --> 01:00:16.069
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

01:01:16.389 --> 01:01:17.469
Come on, man.

01:01:39.389 --> 01:01:40.389
Ahhh!

01:02:22.429 --> 01:02:23.869
Sam, southwest rooftop.

01:02:24.029 --> 01:02:25.309
<i>Who the hell's the other guy?</i>

01:02:25.389 --> 01:02:26.389
About to find out.

01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:41.109
Sam. <i>Got him.</i>

01:03:22.749 --> 01:03:23.749
<i>Stand down!</i>

01:03:26.909 --> 01:03:27.909
<i>Stand down!</i>

01:03:56.869 --> 01:03:58.349
Sam, I can't shake this guy.

01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:59.789
Right behind you.

01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:36.989
Stand down, now.

01:05:43.989 --> 01:05:45.709
<i>Congratulations, Cap.</i>

01:05:45.909 --> 01:05:47.469
<i>You're a criminal.</i>

01:06:10.389 --> 01:06:11.669
<i>Your Highness.</i>
