00:00:57.656 --> 00:00:59.456
<i>The Task Force
called for a psychiatrist</i>

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:01.256
<i>as soon as Barnes was captured.</i>

00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:03.696
<i>The UN dispatched
Doctor Theo Broussard</i>

00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:05.216
<i>from Geneva within the hour.</i>

00:01:05.376 --> 00:01:07.016
<i>He was met by this man.</i>

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:08.176
Did you run facial
recognition yet?

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:09.376
<i>What do I look like?</i>

00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:11.536
Uh, I don't know.
I've been picturing a redhead.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:13.296
<i>You must be thinking
of someone else.</i>

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:14.456
Must be.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:17.376
<i>The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.</i>

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.696
<i>Sokovian Intelligence.</i>

00:01:21.776 --> 00:01:23.696
<i>Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...</i>

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:26.376
<i>a Sokovian covert kill squad.</i>

00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:30.016
What happened to
the real Broussard?

00:01:30.176 --> 00:01:32.056
<i>He was found dead
in a Berlin hotel room.</i>

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:34.896
<i>Where police also found a
wig and facial prosthesis...</i>

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:39.136
<i>approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.</i>

00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:41.976
Son of a bitch.

00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:45.896
- Get this to Ross.
<i>- Yes, boss.</i>

00:03:49.464 --> 00:03:50.904
The Stone reacts
to anything organic.

00:03:51.224 --> 00:03:53.224
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

00:03:53.304 --> 00:03:56.424
All Ronan's got to do is touch the
Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

00:03:56.544 --> 00:03:58.264
All plants, animals,

00:03:58.384 --> 00:03:59.784
- Nova Corps.
- Everything will die.

00:04:00.544 --> 00:04:02.464
So Ronan does not
make the surface.

00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:07.424
<i>Rocket will lead a
team to blow a hole</i>

00:04:07.584 --> 00:04:09.664
in the <i>Dark Aster's</i>
starboard hull.

00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:13.824
Then, our craft and
Yondu's will enter.

00:04:13.904 --> 00:04:16.744
Won't there be hundreds
of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

00:04:16.824 --> 00:04:19.704
I think of Sakaaran
as paper people.

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:26.864
Once they know we're on board,

00:04:27.224 --> 00:04:30.504
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

00:04:30.584 --> 00:04:32.944
<i>Which I can disable by
dismantling the power source.</i>

00:04:33.264 --> 00:04:34.864
<i>We'll make it to
the flight deck,</i>

00:04:34.944 --> 00:04:37.944
<i>and I'll use the Hadron
Enforcer to kill Ronan.</i>

00:04:40.624 --> 00:04:43.624
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

00:04:44.264 --> 00:04:46.304
Use these devices to contain it.

00:04:46.664 --> 00:04:47.944
If you touch it,

00:04:48.744 --> 00:04:50.184
it will kill you.

00:04:52.864 --> 00:04:54.784
<i>I'll contact one of
the Nova officers</i>

00:04:54.864 --> 00:04:56.224
<i>who arrested us.</i>

00:04:56.344 --> 00:04:57.824
<i>Hopefully, they'll believe
we're there to help.</i>

00:04:59.504 --> 00:05:02.624
There's one more thing we
need to complete the plan.

00:05:03.464 --> 00:05:04.624
That guy's eye.

00:05:05.544 --> 00:05:07.984
No! No, we don't.
No, we don't need

00:05:08.304 --> 00:05:09.544
that guy's eye.

00:05:10.624 --> 00:05:13.304
- No, seriously, I need it!
- It's important to me.

00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:19.584
<i>Ronan's fleet has been spotted,</i>

00:05:19.664 --> 00:05:20.784
<i>and will arrive in T-minus</i>

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.624
<i>fifteen minutes.</i>

00:05:22.904 --> 00:05:24.464
Remember, boy.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.744
At the end of all this,

00:05:26.864 --> 00:05:28.304
I get the Stone.

00:05:28.464 --> 00:05:30.784
You cross me, we kill you all.

00:05:53.504 --> 00:05:54.744
Let's go get 'em, boys!

00:06:04.344 --> 00:06:05.584
This is a terrible plan.

00:06:05.704 --> 00:06:07.784
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:20.005
<i>This is Raft Prison Control.</i>

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:22.605
<i>You're cleared for
landing, Mr. Stark.</i>

00:06:55.045 --> 00:06:57.085
So? You got the files?

00:06:57.245 --> 00:06:58.405
Let's reroute the satellites,

00:06:58.565 --> 00:07:00.485
start facial scanning
for this Zemo guy.

00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:02.765
You seriously think
I'm gonna listen to you

00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:05.005
after that fiasco in Leipzig?

00:07:05.165 --> 00:07:07.605
You're lucky you're
not in one of these cells.

00:07:38.285 --> 00:07:40.925
The Futurist, gentlemen!

00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:43.525
The Futurist is here!

00:07:43.725 --> 00:07:45.045
He sees all!

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:49.125
He knows what's best for
you, whether you like it or not.

00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:50.765
Give me a break, Barton.

00:07:50.925 --> 00:07:53.485
<i>I had no idea they'd put you here.
Come on.</i>

00:07:53.965 --> 00:07:56.725
Yeah, well, you knew they'd
put us somewhere, Tony.

00:07:56.885 --> 00:08:00.045
Yeah, but not some
super-max floating ocean pokey.

00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:02.645
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...

00:08:02.805 --> 00:08:04.085
Criminals?

00:08:05.245 --> 00:08:06.965
Criminals, Tony.

00:08:07.485 --> 00:08:09.805
Think that's the word
you're looking for.

00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:12.285
Right?

00:08:12.805 --> 00:08:14.565
That didn't used to mean me.

00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:16.565
Or Sam, or Wanda.

00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:18.285
But here we are.

00:08:18.445 --> 00:08:20.125
Because you broke the law. Yeah.

00:08:20.285 --> 00:08:21.325
I didn't make you.

00:08:22.765 --> 00:08:24.285
La, la, la, la, la...
You read it, you broke it.

00:08:25.845 --> 00:08:28.165
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.

00:08:28.325 --> 00:08:29.485
I don't understand,
why didn't you

00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:31.485
think about them before
you chose the wrong side?

00:08:32.605 --> 00:08:34.525
You gotta watch your
back with this guy.

00:08:35.845 --> 00:08:37.965
There's a chance
he's gonna break it.

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:42.685
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.

00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:44.925
Who are you?

00:08:45.685 --> 00:08:47.445
Come on, man.

00:08:48.845 --> 00:08:49.845
How's Rhodes?

00:08:50.045 --> 00:08:52.885
They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow...

00:08:53.045 --> 00:08:54.205
so fingers crossed.

00:08:55.845 --> 00:08:57.445
What do you need?
They feed you yet?

00:08:59.485 --> 00:09:01.045
You're the good cop, now?

00:09:01.725 --> 00:09:03.485
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.

00:09:03.685 --> 00:09:05.205
Well, you better
go get a bad cop...

00:09:05.365 --> 00:09:07.445
because you're gonna have to
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...

00:09:07.645 --> 00:09:09.565
to get information out of me.

00:09:09.725 --> 00:09:11.725
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:13.045
We got about 30 seconds before

00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:14.725
they realize it's
not their equipment.

00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:16.725
What'd you do?

00:09:16.885 --> 00:09:18.485
Get it back up!

00:09:19.205 --> 00:09:20.165
Just look.

00:09:21.565 --> 00:09:22.965
Because that...

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.245
is the fellow who was
supposed to interrogate Barnes.

00:09:26.845 --> 00:09:29.405
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.

00:09:29.565 --> 00:09:31.045
That's a first.

00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:32.805
Cap is definitely
off the reservation...

00:09:32.885 --> 00:09:34.405
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.

00:09:34.925 --> 00:09:36.005
We don't know
each other very well.

00:09:36.085 --> 00:09:37.165
You don't have to...

00:09:37.245 --> 00:09:39.645
Hey, it's all right.

00:09:47.365 --> 00:09:49.005
Look, I'll tell you...

00:09:49.165 --> 00:09:52.245
but you have to go
alone and as a friend.

00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:54.845
Easy.

00:09:57.765 --> 00:09:58.845
Stark?

00:09:59.445 --> 00:10:01.085
Did he give you
anything on Rogers?

00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:02.285
Nope. Told me to go to hell.

00:10:02.445 --> 00:10:04.285
I'm going back to the
compound instead,

00:10:04.405 --> 00:10:06.365
but you can call me anytime.

00:10:06.525 --> 00:10:08.125
I'll put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.

00:10:59.085 --> 00:11:00.085
Nova Prime.

00:11:01.725 --> 00:11:02.885
I received a transmission

00:11:03.005 --> 00:11:04.205
from one of the Ravagers.

00:11:04.845 --> 00:11:07.525
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

00:11:07.645 --> 00:11:08.925
and he's headed toward Xandar.

00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:10.165
Good God.

00:11:10.525 --> 00:11:12.285
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:14.925
Did he say why we
should believe him?

00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:17.165
He said his crew just
escaped from prison

00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:20.285
so he'd have no other reason
to risk coming to Xandar to help.

00:11:21.085 --> 00:11:22.285
He says that he's an

00:11:23.285 --> 00:11:24.525
"a-hole."

00:11:24.805 --> 00:11:25.965
But he's not,

00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:27.885
and I'm quoting him, here,

00:11:28.005 --> 00:11:30.165
"100% a dick."

00:11:30.285 --> 00:11:31.725
Do you believe him?

00:11:32.285 --> 00:11:35.525
I don't know that I believe
anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

00:11:35.605 --> 00:11:38.525
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

00:11:42.125 --> 00:11:43.125
Yeah.

00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:54.765
A fleet approaches.

00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:56.805
They appear to be Ravagers.

00:12:07.845 --> 00:12:08.925
Fire!

00:12:20.205 --> 00:12:21.325
<i>Cover it down.</i>

00:12:21.645 --> 00:12:23.645
Submerge!

00:12:36.365 --> 00:12:37.725
Rocket, hurry!

00:12:44.165 --> 00:12:45.325
All pilots, dive!

00:12:45.645 --> 00:12:46.765
<i>They're beneath us!</i>

00:12:55.645 --> 00:12:56.965
Evacuate the city.

00:12:57.085 --> 00:13:00.685
Our priority is to get our
people away from the battle.

00:13:07.725 --> 00:13:08.725
Forward thrust, now!

00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:23.165
Come on!

00:13:24.885 --> 00:13:26.405
Quill! Yondu! Now!

00:13:48.845 --> 00:13:50.245
Aw, hell!

00:13:50.365 --> 00:13:51.925
I'm going down, Quill!

00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:53.845
No more games with me, boy!

00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:55.005
I'll see you

00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:56.925
<i>at the end of this!</i>

00:14:03.165 --> 00:14:04.685
There are too many
of them, Rocket!

00:14:05.285 --> 00:14:07.085
We'll never make it up there!

00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:23.205
<i>Peter Quill.</i>

00:14:23.325 --> 00:14:25.845
This is Denarian Saal
of the Nova Corps.

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:29.205
For the record, I advised
against trusting you here.

00:14:29.325 --> 00:14:30.805
They got my "dick" message!

00:14:31.165 --> 00:14:32.285
Prove me wrong.

00:14:39.885 --> 00:14:41.805
Yes!

00:15:02.965 --> 00:15:04.005
Yes!

00:15:07.325 --> 00:15:09.165
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

00:15:13.285 --> 00:15:14.885
The starboard kern
has been breached!

00:15:15.005 --> 00:15:16.245
We have been boarded.

00:15:16.325 --> 00:15:17.845
Continue our approach.

00:15:18.005 --> 00:15:19.205
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

00:15:19.325 --> 00:15:22.045
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

00:15:22.165 --> 00:15:23.165
Seal security doors!

00:15:23.365 --> 00:15:24.365
Now!

00:15:26.205 --> 00:15:28.365
Get out of my way!

00:15:39.765 --> 00:15:41.205
Oh, man.

00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:45.845
All Nova pilots, interlock
and form a blockade.

00:15:45.965 --> 00:15:49.845
<i>The</i> Dark Aster <i>must
not reach the ground.</i>

00:16:02.245 --> 00:16:03.405
Locked in!

00:16:04.285 --> 00:16:05.405
Locked in.

00:16:07.045 --> 00:16:08.045
We're locked in.

00:16:46.285 --> 00:16:48.445
I can barely see.

00:17:14.965 --> 00:17:16.525
When did you learn to do that?

00:17:17.165 --> 00:17:18.245
Pretty sure the answer is

00:17:18.365 --> 00:17:20.045
"I am Groot."

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:23.605
The flight deck is
300 meters this way.

00:17:26.965 --> 00:17:30.325
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:33.085
It is pleasing to
once again have

00:17:33.605 --> 00:17:34.605
friends.

00:17:35.645 --> 00:17:38.565
You, Quill, are my friend.

00:17:38.645 --> 00:17:39.965
Thanks.

00:17:40.165 --> 00:17:42.925
- This dumb tree, he is my friend.
- Mmm.

00:17:44.325 --> 00:17:45.485
And this green
whore, she, too...

00:17:45.605 --> 00:17:47.205
Oh, you must stop!

00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:52.925
Gamora, look at
what you have done.

00:17:53.485 --> 00:17:55.485
You have always been weak.

00:17:55.685 --> 00:17:58.005
You stupid, traitorous...

00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:05.405
Nobody talks to
my friends like that.

00:18:06.525 --> 00:18:07.565
Head to the flight deck.

00:18:07.685 --> 00:18:10.405
I'll shut down the power
to the security doors.

00:18:34.027 --> 00:18:35.507
You remember that
time we had to ride back

00:18:35.627 --> 00:18:37.947
from Rockaway Beach in
the back of that freezer truck?

00:18:38.107 --> 00:18:40.147
Was that the time we
used our train money

00:18:40.307 --> 00:18:41.347
to buy hot dogs?

00:18:41.547 --> 00:18:43.107
You blew three
bucks trying to win

00:18:43.187 --> 00:18:44.707
that stuffed bear for a redhead.

00:18:45.347 --> 00:18:46.347
What was her name, again?

00:18:46.547 --> 00:18:48.347
Dolores. You called her Dot.

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.547
She's gotta be a hundred
years old right now.

00:18:50.707 --> 00:18:51.867
So are we, pal.

00:19:01.627 --> 00:19:03.707
He can't have been here
more than a few hours.

00:19:03.867 --> 00:19:05.867
Long enough to wake them up.

00:19:48.067 --> 00:19:49.067
You ready?

00:19:49.227 --> 00:19:50.227
Yeah.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.867
You seem a little defensive.

00:20:07.107 --> 00:20:08.267
It's been a long day.

00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:10.947
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.

00:20:11.107 --> 00:20:12.347
Then why are you here?

00:20:13.427 --> 00:20:16.027
Could be your
story's not so crazy.

00:20:16.107 --> 00:20:17.107
Maybe.

00:20:18.867 --> 00:20:21.627
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.

00:20:22.747 --> 00:20:24.747
Otherwise, I
gotta arrest myself.

00:20:26.027 --> 00:20:27.627
Well, that sounds
like a lot of paperwork.

00:20:31.387 --> 00:20:32.627
It's good to see you, Tony.

00:20:32.747 --> 00:20:33.747
You too, Cap.

00:20:34.987 --> 00:20:37.227
Hey, Manchurian
Candidate, you're killing me.

00:20:37.307 --> 00:20:39.307
There's a truce here.
You can drop...

00:20:55.301 --> 00:20:56.541
Nebula, please.

00:21:10.981 --> 00:21:13.781
Enough of this.
Necrocraft pilots,

00:21:13.901 --> 00:21:15.941
enact immolation initiative.

00:21:19.541 --> 00:21:20.941
They're dive-bombing the city!

00:21:21.021 --> 00:21:22.861
Denarian Saal, should
we break formation?

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:24.701
No! Hold your positions.

00:21:56.221 --> 00:21:57.781
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.581
<i>We'll take care of
the people down here.</i>

00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:01.821
I can't believe I'm taking
orders from a hamster.

00:22:04.495 --> 00:22:05.695
Star-Lord.

00:22:06.255 --> 00:22:07.255
Finally.

00:22:12.695 --> 00:22:13.895
Ah!

00:22:18.215 --> 00:22:19.215
You thief!

00:22:31.135 --> 00:22:33.815
You will never make it to Ronan.

00:22:41.077 --> 00:22:42.917
Yondu Udonta.

00:22:43.037 --> 00:22:46.677
Order your men to
turn on the Nova Corps.

00:23:03.277 --> 00:23:04.877
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

00:23:05.037 --> 00:23:06.877
Time to die...

00:23:43.558 --> 00:23:44.878
<i>I got heat signatures.</i>

00:23:45.038 --> 00:23:46.518
How many?

00:23:47.558 --> 00:23:49.438
<i>Uh, one.</i>

00:24:08.078 --> 00:24:10.278
<i>If it's any comfort,</i>

00:24:10.438 --> 00:24:11.958
<i>they died in their sleep.</i>

00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:22.078
<i>Did you really think I
wanted more of you?</i>

00:24:23.238 --> 00:24:24.958
What the hell?

00:24:25.758 --> 00:24:27.558
<i>I'm grateful to them, though.</i>

00:24:28.638 --> 00:24:30.118
<i>They brought you here.</i>

00:24:34.878 --> 00:24:36.598
<i>Please, Captain.</i>

00:24:36.758 --> 00:24:38.558
<i>The Soviets built this
chamber to withstand</i>

00:24:38.638 --> 00:24:41.238
<i>the launch blast
of UR-100 rockets.</i>

00:24:41.398 --> 00:24:43.158
<i>I'm betting I could beat that.</i>

00:24:43.318 --> 00:24:45.118
<i>Oh, I'm sure you
could, Mr. Stark.</i>

00:24:45.598 --> 00:24:47.118
<i>Given time.</i>

00:24:47.598 --> 00:24:49.238
<i>But then you'd never
know why you came.</i>

00:24:49.398 --> 00:24:51.958
You killed innocent people in
Vienna just to bring us here?

00:24:58.678 --> 00:25:02.278
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.

00:25:02.958 --> 00:25:04.798
I studied you.

00:25:05.158 --> 00:25:06.678
I followed you.

00:25:07.238 --> 00:25:08.998
But now that you're
standing here...

00:25:09.158 --> 00:25:11.278
I just realized...

00:25:13.318 --> 00:25:15.918
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.

00:25:18.318 --> 00:25:20.798
How nice to find a flaw.

00:25:21.358 --> 00:25:22.918
You're Sokovian.

00:25:24.118 --> 00:25:25.638
Is that what this is about?

00:25:25.798 --> 00:25:27.438
Sokovia was a failed state

00:25:27.518 --> 00:25:29.278
long before you blew it to hell.

00:25:29.358 --> 00:25:30.358
No.

00:25:31.878 --> 00:25:34.878
I'm here because
I made a promise.

00:25:38.038 --> 00:25:39.198
You lost someone?

00:25:43.118 --> 00:25:45.158
I lost everyone.

00:25:46.998 --> 00:25:48.598
And so will you.

00:25:54.878 --> 00:25:58.518
An empire toppled by its
enemies can rise again.

00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.718
But one which
crumbles from within?

00:26:03.358 --> 00:26:04.838
That's dead.

00:26:05.958 --> 00:26:06.998
Forever.

00:26:15.798 --> 00:26:17.518
I know that road.

00:26:19.838 --> 00:26:20.918
What is this?

00:26:44.118 --> 00:26:45.718
<i>Help my wife.</i>

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:49.118
<i>Please. Help.</i>

00:26:54.718 --> 00:26:55.878
<i>Sergeant Barnes?</i>

00:26:57.558 --> 00:26:58.918
<i>Howard!</i>

00:27:06.398 --> 00:27:07.558
<i>Howard!</i>

00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:46.558
No, Tony.

00:27:55.678 --> 00:27:56.998
Did you know?

00:27:59.438 --> 00:28:00.678
I didn't know it was him.

00:28:00.838 --> 00:28:03.358
Don't bullshit me, Rogers.
Did you know?

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.760
Yes.

00:28:58.457 --> 00:29:02.057
Finger to the
throat means death.

00:29:07.737 --> 00:29:09.217
Metaphor.

00:29:09.377 --> 00:29:10.577
Yeah, sorta.

00:29:10.737 --> 00:29:12.057
Oh, no.

00:29:42.204 --> 00:29:44.404
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:54.404
Come on!

00:30:05.778 --> 00:30:07.098
Xandar!

00:30:07.818 --> 00:30:10.338
You stand accused.

00:30:11.178 --> 00:30:14.218
<i>Your wretched
peace treaty will not</i>

00:30:14.338 --> 00:30:15.498
<i>save you now.</i>

00:30:16.058 --> 00:30:19.298
It is the tinder on
which you burn.

00:30:43.978 --> 00:30:44.978
Rocket!

00:30:45.098 --> 00:30:46.938
Hold on, Saal, just...

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:14.898
Quill, you gotta hurry.

00:31:15.058 --> 00:31:16.538
<i>The city's been evacuated,</i>

00:31:16.858 --> 00:31:19.298
<i>but we're getting our
asses kicked down here.</i>

00:31:19.378 --> 00:31:20.898
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

00:31:45.498 --> 00:31:46.498
Nebula!

00:31:48.178 --> 00:31:50.578
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

00:31:50.938 --> 00:31:52.298
You know he's crazy.

00:31:52.898 --> 00:31:54.938
I know you're both crazy.

00:31:55.058 --> 00:31:56.178
No!

00:31:59.098 --> 00:32:00.098
- What the...?
- Ah!

00:32:01.298 --> 00:32:02.938
Get out!

00:32:44.258 --> 00:32:45.258
You did it!

00:33:11.658 --> 00:33:13.098
I was mistaken.

00:33:13.178 --> 00:33:14.658
I do remember your family.

00:33:15.378 --> 00:33:17.178
Their screams were

00:33:17.298 --> 00:33:19.378
pitiful. I...

00:34:15.105 --> 00:34:16.465
Get out of here!

00:34:27.705 --> 00:34:28.745
It wasn't him, Tony.

00:34:28.825 --> 00:34:29.825
HYDRA had control of his mind!

00:34:29.945 --> 00:34:30.905
Move!

00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:31.985
It wasn't him!

00:34:40.945 --> 00:34:42.465
<i>Left boot jet failing.</i>

00:34:43.225 --> 00:34:45.305
<i>Flight systems compromised.</i>

00:34:45.905 --> 00:34:46.985
Ah, crap.

00:35:00.825 --> 00:35:02.545
He's not gonna stop. Go.

00:35:25.545 --> 00:35:26.545
Come on, come on.

00:35:26.705 --> 00:35:28.345
<i>Targeting system's
knackered, boss.</i>

00:35:28.505 --> 00:35:29.505
I'm eyeballing it.

00:35:48.065 --> 00:35:49.705
Do you even remember them?

00:35:49.865 --> 00:35:51.625
I remember all of them.

00:36:14.425 --> 00:36:16.385
This isn't gonna
change what happened.

00:36:16.545 --> 00:36:18.065
I don't care.

00:36:18.745 --> 00:36:20.105
He killed my mom.

00:37:21.465 --> 00:37:23.105
<i>You should have
seen his little face.</i>

00:37:23.185 --> 00:37:24.785
<i>Just try, okay?</i>

00:37:24.945 --> 00:37:26.825
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

00:37:27.025 --> 00:37:28.625
<i>I love you.</i>

00:37:36.665 --> 00:37:39.185
I almost killed the wrong man.

00:37:40.185 --> 00:37:42.185
Hardly an innocent one.

00:37:42.305 --> 00:37:43.985
This is all you wanted?

00:37:44.985 --> 00:37:47.505
To see them rip
each other apart.

00:37:51.505 --> 00:37:54.105
My father lived
outside the city.

00:37:55.025 --> 00:37:57.385
I thought we
would be safe there.

00:37:57.985 --> 00:37:59.825
My son was excited.

00:37:59.985 --> 00:38:02.825
He could see the Iron
Man from the car window.

00:38:03.865 --> 00:38:07.105
I told my wife, "Don't worry.

00:38:07.265 --> 00:38:11.185
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."

00:38:13.505 --> 00:38:15.905
When the dust cleared...

00:38:16.705 --> 00:38:19.105
and the screaming stopped...

00:38:19.865 --> 00:38:23.785
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.

00:38:26.105 --> 00:38:27.705
My father...

00:38:28.545 --> 00:38:32.025
still holding my wife
and son in his arms.

00:38:36.545 --> 00:38:38.545
And the Avengers?

00:38:39.545 --> 00:38:41.305
They went home.

00:38:43.185 --> 00:38:45.425
I knew I couldn't kill them.

00:38:45.585 --> 00:38:48.065
More powerful men
than me have tried.

00:38:50.305 --> 00:38:52.625
<i>But, if I could get
them to kill each other...</i>

00:38:57.105 --> 00:38:59.905
I'm sorry about your father.

00:39:00.305 --> 00:39:02.145
He seemed a good man.

00:39:04.065 --> 00:39:05.545
With a dutiful son.

00:39:10.145 --> 00:39:12.065
Vengeance has consumed you.

00:39:14.745 --> 00:39:17.065
It's consuming them.

00:39:20.985 --> 00:39:23.145
I am done letting it consume me.

00:39:26.785 --> 00:39:29.105
Justice will come soon enough.

00:39:32.465 --> 00:39:34.305
Tell that to the dead.

00:39:38.785 --> 00:39:41.505
The living are not
done with you, yet.

00:41:24.818 --> 00:41:25.938
No, Groot!

00:41:26.618 --> 00:41:27.698
You can't.

00:41:27.778 --> 00:41:29.098
You'll die.

00:41:29.778 --> 00:41:31.658
Why are you doing this?

00:41:31.778 --> 00:41:33.378
Why?

00:41:39.898 --> 00:41:41.498
We

00:41:41.818 --> 00:41:42.898
are

00:41:43.578 --> 00:41:44.978
Groot.

00:42:10.516 --> 00:42:12.956
<i>You can't beat him hand-to-hand.</i>

00:42:14.156 --> 00:42:15.316
Analyze his fight pattern.

00:42:15.596 --> 00:42:16.796
<i>Scanning.</i>

00:42:21.476 --> 00:42:22.636
<i>Countermeasures ready.</i>

00:42:24.676 --> 00:42:25.676
Let's kick his ass.

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:40.796
He's my friend.

00:42:41.516 --> 00:42:42.556
So was I.

00:42:49.476 --> 00:42:51.636
<i>Stay down. Final warning.</i>

00:43:05.996 --> 00:43:07.596
I could do this all day.

00:44:14.556 --> 00:44:16.876
That shield doesn't
belong to you.

00:44:18.436 --> 00:44:20.076
You don't deserve it.

00:44:20.236 --> 00:44:22.236
My father made that shield!

00:45:32.298 --> 00:45:34.298
I called him an idiot.

00:45:56.898 --> 00:45:58.818
You killed Groot!

00:46:02.978 --> 00:46:04.418
Behold!

00:46:05.338 --> 00:46:08.698
Your guardians of the galaxy.

00:46:08.778 --> 00:46:11.338
What fruit have they wrought?

00:46:11.418 --> 00:46:15.498
Only that my
father and his father

00:46:15.578 --> 00:46:19.018
shall finally know vengeance.

00:46:19.338 --> 00:46:21.538
People of Xandar,

00:46:22.258 --> 00:46:23.858
the time has come

00:46:24.018 --> 00:46:26.858
to rejoice and renounce

00:46:26.978 --> 00:46:29.338
your paltry gods!

00:46:30.018 --> 00:46:33.458
Your salvation is at hand.

00:46:46.298 --> 00:46:47.698
Listen to these words.

00:46:56.738 --> 00:46:58.498
Now bring it down hard!

00:47:01.858 --> 00:47:02.898
What are you doing?

00:47:03.498 --> 00:47:05.938
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

00:47:09.498 --> 00:47:10.818
Gamora.

00:47:11.858 --> 00:47:13.898
Subtle. Take it back.

00:47:14.418 --> 00:47:16.618
What are you doing?

00:47:16.898 --> 00:47:19.298
I'm distracting you,
you big turd blossom.

00:47:35.538 --> 00:47:36.898
No!

00:48:10.938 --> 00:48:14.018
Peter! Take my hand!

00:48:19.578 --> 00:48:21.578
Take my hand, Peter.

00:48:22.498 --> 00:48:23.858
Mom.

00:48:24.458 --> 00:48:26.458
<i>Take my hand!</i>

00:49:20.858 --> 00:49:22.818
You're mortal!

00:49:22.938 --> 00:49:24.178
How?

00:49:24.538 --> 00:49:26.658
You said it yourself, bitch.

00:49:26.738 --> 00:49:29.018
We're the Guardians
of the Galaxy.

00:49:58.938 --> 00:50:00.098
Well, well, well.

00:50:00.738 --> 00:50:01.818
Quite the light show.

00:50:04.058 --> 00:50:05.778
Ain't this sweet.

00:50:07.218 --> 00:50:09.818
But you got some
business to attend to

00:50:09.938 --> 00:50:12.498
before all the
nookie-nookie starts.

00:50:14.058 --> 00:50:16.218
Peter, you can't. Peter.

00:50:16.538 --> 00:50:18.578
You gotta reconsider
this, Yondu.

00:50:18.938 --> 00:50:20.618
I don't know who
you're selling this to,

00:50:20.698 --> 00:50:22.618
but the only way the
universe can survive

00:50:22.738 --> 00:50:24.498
is if you give it to
the Nova Corps.

00:50:25.178 --> 00:50:27.498
I may be as pretty as an angel,

00:50:29.698 --> 00:50:31.578
but I sure as hell ain't one.

00:50:33.178 --> 00:50:34.778
Hand it over, son.

00:50:51.658 --> 00:50:52.658
Yondu.

00:50:55.738 --> 00:50:58.938
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

00:50:59.658 --> 00:51:02.018
You've seen what
it does to people.

00:51:12.858 --> 00:51:15.018
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

00:51:15.938 --> 00:51:18.658
It's probably good we
didn't deliver him to his dad

00:51:18.738 --> 00:51:19.738
like we was hired to do.

00:51:19.818 --> 00:51:22.618
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

00:51:27.298 --> 00:51:30.898
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

00:51:33.738 --> 00:51:35.618
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

00:51:36.778 --> 00:51:38.338
Oh, I know.

00:51:40.218 --> 00:51:41.898
But he was about
the only family I had.

00:51:44.818 --> 00:51:45.858
No.

00:51:47.098 --> 00:51:48.258
He wasn't.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.680
Meals at 8 and 5.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.520
Toilet privileges twice a day.

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.040
Raise your voice, zap.

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.880
Touch the glass, zap.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.080
You step out of line,
you deal with me.

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.600
Please, step out of line, hmm?

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.120
So how does it feel?

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.440
To spend all that
time, all that effort...

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:05.640
to see it fail so spectacularly?

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.760
Did it?

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.280
It's just the first pass.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.400
Yeah.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.520
Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.360
Shock absorption,
lateral movement.

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.960
Cup holder?

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.840
You may wanna think
about some AC down in...

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:48.000
Ow.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.800
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.640
No. Don't help me.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.840
Ah.

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.120
138.

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.480
138 combat missions.

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.400
That's how many
I've flown, Tony.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.640
Every one of them could've
been my last, but I flew them.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.200
Because the fight
needed to be fought.

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.360
It's the same with
these Accords.

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:29.400
I signed because it
was the right thing to do.

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.400
And yeah, this sucks.
This is, uh...

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.480
This is a bad beat.

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.240
But it hasn't changed my mind.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.240
I don't think.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.080
You okay? Oh, yeah.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.360
Are you Tony Stank?

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:05.840
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.680
Thank you for that!

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.720
Never dropping that, by the way.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:11.880
"Table for one, Mr. Stank.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.200
"Please, by the bathroom."

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.600
<i>Tony...</i>

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.760
<i>I'm glad you're back
at the compound.</i>

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.920
<i>I don't like the idea of you</i>

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.720
<i>rattling around a
mansion by yourself.</i>

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.560
<i>We all need family.</i>

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.880
<i>The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.</i>

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.040
<i>I've been on my
own since I was 18.</i>

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.560
<i>I never really fit in anywhere,</i>

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.480
<i>even in the Army.</i>

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.280
<i>My faith's in people, I guess.</i>

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.640
<i>Individuals.</i>

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.640
<i>And I'm happy to say
that, for the most part...</i>

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.400
<i>they haven't let me down.</i>

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.960
<i>Which is why I can't
let them down either.</i>

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:06.240
<i>Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.</i>

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.280
<i>I know I hurt you, Tony.</i>

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.200
<i>I guess I thought
by not telling you</i>

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.480
<i>about your parents...</i>

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.960
<i>I was sparing you...</i>

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.760
<i>but I can see now that I
was really sparing myself.</i>

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.240
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.040
<i>Hopefully one day
you can understand.</i>

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.240
<i>I wish we agreed on the Accords.</i>

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.920
<i>I really do.</i>

00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.600
<i>I know you're doing
what you believe in,</i>

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.240
<i>and that's all any of us can do.</i>

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.680
<i>That's all any of us should.</i>

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.760
<i>Priority call from
Secretary Ross.</i>

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.680
<i>There's been a breach
at the Raft prison.</i>

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.200
Yeah, put him through.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.680
<i>Tony, we have a problem.</i>

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.880
Uh, please hold. <i>No, don't.</i>

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.120
<i>So no matter what...</i>

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.520
<i>I promise you...</i>

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.440
<i>if you need us...</i>

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.680
<i>if you need me...</i>

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.800
<i>I'll be there.</i>

00:57:07.638 --> 00:57:08.878
<i>Why would you even know this?</i>

00:57:09.198 --> 00:57:11.958
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

00:57:12.038 --> 00:57:13.358
so we had it checked out.

00:57:14.838 --> 00:57:16.318
I'm not Terran?

00:57:16.678 --> 00:57:18.038
You are half Terran.

00:57:18.198 --> 00:57:21.878
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

00:57:22.038 --> 00:57:25.678
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

00:57:25.918 --> 00:57:27.038
That could be why you were able

00:57:27.198 --> 00:57:29.398
to hold the Stone
for as long as you did.

00:57:29.958 --> 00:57:31.318
Your friends have arrived.

00:57:33.238 --> 00:57:35.638
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

00:57:35.958 --> 00:57:38.638
we'd like to express
our profound gratitude

00:57:39.318 --> 00:57:41.078
for your help in saving Xandar.

00:57:42.918 --> 00:57:45.718
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

00:57:45.878 --> 00:57:47.318
he has something to show you.

00:57:47.638 --> 00:57:49.238
Thank you, Nova Prime.

00:57:57.918 --> 00:58:02.318
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

00:58:02.918 --> 00:58:04.078
Yes.

00:58:04.198 --> 00:58:06.118
Of course, Ronan
was only a puppet.

00:58:06.918 --> 00:58:09.078
It's really Thanos
I need to kill.

00:58:11.798 --> 00:58:14.438
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

00:58:15.078 --> 00:58:17.078
We salvaged as much as we could.

00:58:18.318 --> 00:58:19.438
Wow.

00:58:20.158 --> 00:58:21.158
I...

00:58:23.158 --> 00:58:24.278
Thank you.

00:58:25.878 --> 00:58:27.438
I have a family.

00:58:28.038 --> 00:58:29.438
They're alive because of you.

00:58:34.158 --> 00:58:36.438
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

00:58:36.798 --> 00:58:40.798
However, I have to warn you
against breaking any laws in the future.

00:58:41.278 --> 00:58:42.278
Question.

00:58:42.438 --> 00:58:43.718
What if I see something
that I want to take,

00:58:43.798 --> 00:58:45.038
and it belongs to someone else?

00:58:45.118 --> 00:58:46.358
You will be arrested.

00:58:46.438 --> 00:58:48.798
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:51.158
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

00:58:51.318 --> 00:58:52.318
No, I want it more, sir.
Do you understand?

00:58:52.958 --> 00:58:54.118
What are you laughing at?

00:58:54.318 --> 00:58:55.838
Why? I can't have a
discussion with this gentleman?

00:58:55.918 --> 00:58:57.798
What if someone
does something irksome

00:58:57.918 --> 00:59:00.038
and I decide to
remove his spine?

00:59:01.718 --> 00:59:02.798
That's...

00:59:03.878 --> 00:59:06.078
That's actually murder.

00:59:07.878 --> 00:59:10.318
It's one of the
worst crimes of all.

00:59:10.478 --> 00:59:13.318
So...also illegal.

00:59:14.158 --> 00:59:15.198
Hmm.

00:59:16.998 --> 00:59:18.038
They'll be fine, Dey.

00:59:18.838 --> 00:59:19.958
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

00:59:20.078 --> 00:59:21.078
You?

00:59:24.438 --> 00:59:27.398
Yeah. Me.

00:59:46.398 --> 00:59:48.038
<i>Peter,</i>

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:51.998
<i>I know these last few months
have been hard for you.</i>

00:59:53.198 --> 00:59:55.878
<i>But I'm going to a better place.</i>

00:59:56.038 --> 00:59:58.358
<i>And I will be okay.</i>

00:59:58.518 --> 01:00:02.278
<i>And I will always be with you.</i>

01:00:04.038 --> 01:00:06.798
<i>You are the light of my life.</i>

01:00:06.918 --> 01:00:09.118
<i>My precious son.</i>

01:00:10.078 --> 01:00:13.038
<i>My little Star-Lord.</i>

01:00:13.838 --> 01:00:15.798
<i>Love, Mom.</i>

01:02:16.278 --> 01:02:17.998
So, what should we do next?

01:02:18.278 --> 01:02:19.238
Something good?

01:02:20.318 --> 01:02:21.358
Something bad?

01:02:21.998 --> 01:02:23.518
A bit of both?

01:02:25.198 --> 01:02:28.158
We'll follow your
lead, Star-Lord.

01:02:30.753 --> 01:02:31.753
Bit of both.

01:02:51.883 --> 01:02:53.316
Who was it? Who hit you?

01:02:53.476 --> 01:02:54.636
Some guy.

01:02:54.796 --> 01:02:56.436
So itchy, man, God.

01:02:56.596 --> 01:02:57.796
What's "some guy's" name?

01:02:57.916 --> 01:02:59.436
Uh, Steve.

01:02:59.596 --> 01:03:01.596
Steve? From 12-C?

01:03:01.756 --> 01:03:03.676
With the overbite? No, no, no.

01:03:03.836 --> 01:03:05.476
You don't know him.
He's from Brooklyn.

01:03:08.516 --> 01:03:09.516
Ouch.

01:03:09.636 --> 01:03:10.636
Well...

01:03:11.436 --> 01:03:13.196
I hope you got a
few good licks in.

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:15.796
Yeah, I got quite
a few in, actually.

01:03:16.436 --> 01:03:19.116
His friend was huge. Like huge.

01:03:21.996 --> 01:03:24.316
That's way better. Thank you.

01:03:24.516 --> 01:03:25.956
Okay, tough guy.

01:03:29.156 --> 01:03:31.516
Love you, May.
Hey, can you shut the door?

01:04:45.242 --> 01:04:46.570
Fine...

01:04:48.133 --> 01:04:50.281
I'll do it myself.
