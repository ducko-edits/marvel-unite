WEBVTT

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:13.238
Ooh.

00:00:13.358 --> 00:00:14.998
Stop cheating.

00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:17.318
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:18.368
How was the party?

00:00:25.248 --> 00:00:26.448
Tell me about that tip.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:27.728
What?

00:00:27.808 --> 00:00:29.728
I wanna know about that tip.

00:00:29.808 --> 00:00:32.448
Oh, baby, it's on!
It's so on, right now.

00:00:32.528 --> 00:00:34.888
Calm down, all right?
I just need to know where it came from.

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:36.328
It's gotta be airtight.

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:38.208
Okay.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.528
I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:42.928
Which was mainly reds, and
you know I don't like reds, man.

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:44.888
But there was a rose that saved the day.
It was delightful.

00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:46.688
<i>And then he tells
me about this girl,</i>

00:00:46.808 --> 00:00:47.968
<i>Emily, that we
used to kick it with.</i>

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.248
<i>It was actually the first
pair of boobs I ever touched.</i>

00:00:50.328 --> 00:00:51.968
It's the wrong details.

00:00:52.048 --> 00:00:53.408
It has nothing to
do with the story.

00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:54.528
Go.

00:00:55.328 --> 00:00:57.128
<i>So, uh, he tells me that she's</i>

00:00:57.248 --> 00:00:59.008
<i>working as a
housekeeper now, right?</i>

00:00:59.088 --> 00:01:00.688
<i>And she's dating
this dude, Carlos,</i>

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:02.408
<i>who's a shot caller
from across the bay.</i>

00:01:02.488 --> 00:01:05.568
<i>And she tells him about the
dude that she's cleaning for.</i>

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:08.008
<i>Right?
That he's like this big-shot CEO</i>

00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:10.128
<i>that is all retired
now, but he's loaded.</i>

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:13.928
<i>And so, Carlos and Ernesto
are on the same softball team,</i>

00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:15.688
<i>and they get to talking, right?</i>

00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:19.208
<i>And here comes the good part.
Carlos says, "Yo, man.</i>

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:21.288
<i>"This guy's got a
big-ass safe just</i>

00:01:21.408 --> 00:01:23.368
<i>"sitting in the
basement, just chilling."</i>

00:01:23.448 --> 00:01:24.608
Of course Ernesto
comes to me because

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:25.928
he knows I got
mad thieving skills.

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:26.968
<i>Of course, I ask him...</i>

00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:28.688
<i>"Did Emily tell
Carlos to tell you</i>

00:01:28.848 --> 00:01:30.408
<i>"to get to me what
kind of safe it was?"</i>

00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:31.688
<i>And he says, "Nah, dawg.</i>

00:01:31.768 --> 00:01:33.968
<i>"All she said is
that it's super-legit</i>

00:01:34.048 --> 00:01:36.208
<i>"and whatever's in
it, it's gotta be good."</i>

00:01:39.248 --> 00:01:40.248
What?

00:01:40.328 --> 00:01:42.808
Old man have safe.

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:44.968
And he's gone for a week.

00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:47.048
All right.
There's an old man, he's got a safe,

00:01:47.128 --> 00:01:48.208
and he's gone for a week.

00:01:48.288 --> 00:01:49.368
Let's just work with that.

00:01:49.448 --> 00:01:50.888
You know what I'm saying?

00:02:40.048 --> 00:02:42.848
Landline's cut, cell
signal's jammed.

00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:45.288
No one will be making
for distress call tonight.

00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:46.368
Comm check.

00:02:46.448 --> 00:02:47.528
- Check.
- Check.

00:02:47.608 --> 00:02:49.848
Hey, if the job goes bad, you
know I got your back, right?

00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:51.168
Don't worry.

00:02:51.248 --> 00:02:53.448
It's not gonna happen.

00:02:55.928 --> 00:02:57.648
I love it when he gets cocky.

00:03:03.728 --> 00:03:04.808
Damn!

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:33.568
Alarm is dead.

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:34.728
Nice.

00:03:37.048 --> 00:03:39.408
<i>All right, I'm moving
through the house.</i>

00:04:04.568 --> 00:04:06.448
There's a fingerprint
lock on the door.

00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:09.128
It's got what?
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:11.288
<i>Aw, man, are we screwed?</i>

00:04:11.368 --> 00:04:13.328
Not necessarily.

00:05:01.288 --> 00:05:02.408
I'm in.

00:05:02.528 --> 00:05:05.648
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:11.328
Oh, man.

00:05:11.408 --> 00:05:12.728
<i>What is it?</i>

00:05:13.328 --> 00:05:16.088
Well, they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:18.368
<i>How serious are
we talking, Scotty?</i>

00:05:18.448 --> 00:05:20.128
It's a Carbondale.

00:05:20.248 --> 00:05:21.648
It's from 1910.

00:05:21.728 --> 00:05:24.488
Made from the same
steel as the <i>Titanic.</i>

00:05:24.568 --> 00:05:25.808
Wow.

00:05:25.888 --> 00:05:27.288
Can you crack it?

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:30.768
Well, here's the thing.
It doesn't do so well in the cold.

00:05:30.848 --> 00:05:32.168
Remember what that iceberg did?

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:33.968
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

00:05:34.048 --> 00:05:35.048
Killed everybody.

00:05:35.128 --> 00:05:36.648
Did not kill the old lady.

00:05:36.768 --> 00:05:38.928
She still throw the
jewel into the oceans.

00:06:31.168 --> 00:06:32.648
<i>What are you doing?</i>

00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:35.168
I poured water in the locking
mechanism and froze it with nitrogen.

00:06:35.968 --> 00:06:38.208
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

00:06:38.768 --> 00:06:40.728
<i>What are you doing now?</i> Waiting.

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:43.368
Waiting.

00:06:51.568 --> 00:06:52.568
Nice.

00:06:56.848 --> 00:06:58.488
<i>What is it? Cash? Jewels?</i>

00:06:59.728 --> 00:07:01.608
There's nothing here.
What did you say?

00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:05.088
It's a suit. What?

00:07:05.728 --> 00:07:07.648
It's an old motorcycle suit.

00:07:08.688 --> 00:07:10.568
There's no cash,
no jewelry, nothing?

00:07:10.648 --> 00:07:12.048
No.

00:07:12.928 --> 00:07:13.928
It's a bust.

00:07:14.008 --> 00:07:16.488
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

00:07:16.568 --> 00:07:18.368
I know you needed to score.

00:08:22.849 --> 00:08:24.369
Stark!

00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:26.009
He doesn't seem happy.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:27.409
Hello, Hank.

00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:30.729
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

00:08:30.809 --> 00:08:32.609
I took a detour...

00:08:33.689 --> 00:08:35.809
Through your defense lab.

00:08:36.569 --> 00:08:38.889
Tell me that isn't
what I think it is.

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:42.969
That depends if you think it's a
poor attempt to replicate my work.

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:46.369
Even for this group,
that takes nerve.

00:08:46.449 --> 00:08:47.969
You were instructed
to go to Russia.

00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:50.049
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:51.249
I'm a scientist.

00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:52.969
Then act like one.

00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:55.569
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed.

00:08:55.649 --> 00:08:56.769
Help us put it to good use.

00:08:56.849 --> 00:08:59.289
I let you turn me
into your errand boy,

00:08:59.369 --> 00:09:01.289
and now you try to
steal my research?

00:09:01.369 --> 00:09:05.689
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

00:09:08.169 --> 00:09:09.289
Ah...

00:09:10.369 --> 00:09:12.369
Easy, Hank.

00:09:13.689 --> 00:09:16.369
You mention my wife again

00:09:16.449 --> 00:09:18.489
and I'll show you ferocity.

00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:20.129
Don't look at me. You said it.

00:09:21.249 --> 00:09:23.569
I formally tender
my resignation.

00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:25.929
We don't accept it. Formally.

00:09:26.049 --> 00:09:27.289
Hank,

00:09:27.369 --> 00:09:29.129
we need you.

00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:31.529
The Pym Particle is a miracle.
Please.

00:09:31.609 --> 00:09:33.929
Don't let your past
determine the future.

00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:36.929
As long as I am alive,

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:40.489
nobody will ever
get that formula.

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:49.169
We shouldn't let him
leave the building.

00:09:49.249 --> 00:09:51.409
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:53.049
Yes.

00:09:53.129 --> 00:09:56.129
Our scientists haven't come
close to replicating his work.

00:09:56.209 --> 00:09:58.289
He just kicked
your ass, full-size.

00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:00.849
You really want to find out what it's
like when you can't see him coming?

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:03.529
I've known Hank
Pym for a long time.

00:10:03.609 --> 00:10:05.089
He's no security risk.

00:10:07.329 --> 00:10:09.009
Unless we make him one.

00:10:17.805 --> 00:10:18.925
Gamora.

00:10:19.645 --> 00:10:22.205
Surgically modified and
trained as a living weapon.

00:10:22.325 --> 00:10:24.725
The adopted daughter
of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

00:10:25.285 --> 00:10:28.365
Recently, Thanos lent her and
her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

00:10:28.485 --> 00:10:31.645
which leads us to believe that
Thanos and Ronan are working together.

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:35.965
Subject 89P13.
Calls itself "Rocket."

00:10:36.365 --> 00:10:37.645
The result of illegal genetic

00:10:37.765 --> 00:10:39.325
and cybernetic experiments

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:40.605
on a lower life form.

00:10:40.925 --> 00:10:42.725
What the hell?

00:10:43.245 --> 00:10:44.645
They call it "Groot."

00:10:44.805 --> 00:10:47.325
A humanoid plant that's
been travelling recently

00:10:47.405 --> 00:10:50.565
as 89P13's personal
houseplant/muscle.

00:10:51.965 --> 00:10:54.685
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

00:10:54.885 --> 00:10:57.885
Raised from youth by a band of
mercenaries called the Ravagers,

00:10:58.205 --> 00:10:59.805
led by Yondu Udonta.

00:10:59.965 --> 00:11:01.525
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:11:01.645 --> 00:11:04.565
I didn't know how
this machine worked.

00:11:04.685 --> 00:11:06.765
What a bunch of a-holes.

00:11:08.564 --> 00:11:11.884
I guess most of Nova
Corps wanna uphold the laws,

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:15.484
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

00:11:15.764 --> 00:11:17.804
But, hey, that's not my problem.

00:11:17.924 --> 00:11:19.604
I ain't gonna be here long.

00:11:19.724 --> 00:11:23.244
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

00:11:23.404 --> 00:11:24.604
You're lucky the
broad showed up,

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:25.844
because otherwise, me and Groot

00:11:25.924 --> 00:11:27.764
would be collecting
that bounty right now,

00:11:27.844 --> 00:11:29.764
and you'd be getting
drawn and quartered

00:11:29.924 --> 00:11:30.844
by Yondu and those Ravagers.

00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:33.284
I've had a lot of folks try
to kill me over the years.

00:11:33.364 --> 00:11:36.204
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

00:11:36.284 --> 00:11:37.284
Hold.

00:11:37.404 --> 00:11:39.284
- What's a raccoon?
- "What's a raccoon?"

00:11:39.404 --> 00:11:40.604
It's what you are, stupid.

00:11:40.724 --> 00:11:43.524
Ain't no thing like
me, except me.

00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:46.484
So, this Orb has a
real shiny blue suitcase,

00:11:46.564 --> 00:11:49.604
Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

00:11:50.284 --> 00:11:51.524
- What is it?
- I am Groot.

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.364
So what? What's the Orb?

00:11:53.484 --> 00:11:55.644
I have no words for
an honorless thief.

00:11:55.764 --> 00:11:57.924
Pretty high and mighty
coming from the lackey

00:11:58.244 --> 00:11:59.324
of a genocidal maniac.

00:11:59.404 --> 00:12:01.324
Yeah, I know who you are.

00:12:01.404 --> 00:12:03.404
Anyone who's anyone
knows who you are.

00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:04.964
Yeah, we know who you are.

00:12:05.204 --> 00:12:07.604
- Who is she?
- I am Groot.

00:12:07.684 --> 00:12:09.644
Yeah, you said that.

00:12:10.444 --> 00:12:12.804
I wasn't retrieving
the Orb for Ronan.

00:12:12.964 --> 00:12:14.644
I was betraying him.

00:12:14.804 --> 00:12:16.804
I had an agreement
to sell it to a third party.

00:12:18.724 --> 00:12:20.244
I am Groot.

00:12:20.364 --> 00:12:24.564
Well, that's just as fascinating as
the first 89 times you told me that.

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:26.684
What is wrong with
Giving Tree, here?

00:12:26.804 --> 00:12:29.244
Well, he don't know talking
good like me and you.

00:12:29.324 --> 00:12:33.364
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

00:12:33.444 --> 00:12:34.964
Exclusively in that order.

00:12:35.284 --> 00:12:37.404
I tell you what, that's gonna
wear real thin, real fast.

00:12:38.764 --> 00:12:39.924
Hey.

00:12:40.244 --> 00:12:41.324
Put that away.

00:12:41.564 --> 00:12:43.644
Hey!

00:12:43.724 --> 00:12:45.924
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

00:12:46.244 --> 00:12:47.764
That's mine.
Those belong to impound.

00:12:47.884 --> 00:12:49.764
That tape and
that player is mine!

00:12:53.484 --> 00:12:56.404
<i>Hooked on a Feeling,</i>
Blue Swede, 1973.

00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:57.844
That song belongs to me!

00:14:17.684 --> 00:14:20.604
- You first! You first!
- Murderer!

00:14:20.964 --> 00:14:23.604
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

00:14:23.684 --> 00:14:27.884
You're scum! You're scum!

00:14:30.844 --> 00:14:31.964
It's like I said,

00:14:32.124 --> 00:14:34.004
she's got a rep.

00:14:34.084 --> 00:14:35.964
A lot of prisoners here
have lost their families

00:14:36.124 --> 00:14:38.364
to Ronan and his goons.

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:39.604
She'll last a day, tops.

00:14:39.724 --> 00:14:40.924
Murderer!

00:14:41.444 --> 00:14:42.564
The guards will
protect her, right?

00:14:42.964 --> 00:14:45.124
They're here to stop
us from getting out.

00:14:45.444 --> 00:14:47.404
They don't care what we
do to each other inside.

00:14:47.564 --> 00:14:50.924
Whatever nightmares
the future holds,

00:14:51.044 --> 00:14:54.764
are dreams compared
to what's behind me.

00:14:55.804 --> 00:14:58.644
Check out the new meat.

00:14:58.804 --> 00:15:02.524
I'm gonna slather you
up in Gunavian jelly,

00:15:02.644 --> 00:15:03.884
and go to town...

00:15:08.604 --> 00:15:10.444
Let's make something clear.

00:15:11.564 --> 00:15:14.604
This one here is our booty!

00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:17.004
You wanna get to him,

00:15:17.684 --> 00:15:19.484
you go through us!

00:15:20.164 --> 00:15:22.604
Or, more accurately,

00:15:23.004 --> 00:15:25.484
we go through you.

00:15:35.524 --> 00:15:37.164
I'm with them.

00:15:38.844 --> 00:15:40.524
I hate you.

00:15:41.164 --> 00:15:43.764
No cell's gonna
protect you for long.

00:15:56.084 --> 00:15:57.604
You're dead!

00:15:58.044 --> 00:15:59.044
Dead!

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.240
Secretary Ross has

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.680
a Congressional
Medal of Honor...

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.920
which is one more than you have.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.760
So let's say we
agree to this thing.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.760
How long is it gonna
be before they LoJack us

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.120
like a bunch of
common criminals?

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.320
117 countries want to sign this.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.040
117, Sam, and you're just like,

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.120
"No, that's cool. We got it."

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.320
How long are you
going to play both sides?

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.600
I have an equation.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.760
Oh, this will clear it up.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.760
In the eight years
since Mr. Stark

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.280
announced himself as Iron Man...

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.520
the number of known
enhanced persons

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.960
has grown exponentially.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.840
During the same period...

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.120
the number of potentially
world-ending events

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.840
has risen at a
commensurate rate.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.280
Are you saying it's our fault?

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.120
I'm saying there
may be a causality.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.880
Our very strength
invites challenge.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.520
Challenge incites conflict.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.520
And conflict...

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.280
breeds catastrophe.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.880
Oversight...

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.400
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.560
Boom.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.560
Tony.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.040
You are being
uncharacteristically

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.360
non-hyperverbal.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.720
It's because he's
already made up his mind.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.720
Boy, you know me so well.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.400
Actually, I'm nursing an
electromagnetic headache.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.920
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.600
It's discomfort.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.840
Who's putting coffee
grounds in the disposal?

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.160
Am I running a bed and
breakfast for a biker gang?

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.000
Oh, that's Charles
Spencer, by the way.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.560
He's a great kid.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.080
Computer engineering
degree, 3.6 GPA...

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.920
had a floor-level gig at
Intel planned for the fall.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.600
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.280
before he parked it behind a desk.
See the world.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.920
Maybe be of service.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.160
Charlie didn't want
to go to Vegas or

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.680
Fort Lauderdale,
which is what I would do.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.440
He didn't go to Paris or
Amsterdam, which sounds fun.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.560
He decided to spend his summer

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.200
building sustainable
housing for the poor.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.840
Guess where. Sokovia.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.960
He wanted to make a
difference, I suppose.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.400
We won't know because we dropped

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.760
a building on him while
we were kicking ass.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.560
There's no decision-making
process here.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.560
We need to be put in check!

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.080
Whatever form
that takes, I'm game.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.320
If we can't accept limitations,

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.400
if we're boundary-less...

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.640
we're no better
than the bad guys.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.240
Tony, someone dies on
your watch, you don't give up.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.320
Who said we're giving up?

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.800
We are if we're not taking
responsibility for our actions.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.800
This document
just shifts the blame.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.640
I'm sorry, Steve.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.480
That is dangerously arrogant.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.680
This is the United
Nations we're talking about.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.080
It's not the World
Security Council,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.400
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D.,
it's not HYDRA.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.840
No, but it's run by people

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.320
with agendas, and
agendas change.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.280
That's good.
That's why I'm here.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.600
When I realized what my weapons

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.960
were capable of in
the wrong hands...

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.720
I shut it down and
stopped manufacturing.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.120
Tony, you chose to do that.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.160
If we sign this, we
surrender our right to choose.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.240
What if this panel
sends us somewhere

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.520
we don't think we should go?

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.960
What if there is
somewhere we need to go

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.160
and they don't let us?

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.840
We may not be perfect,

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.640
but the safest hands
are still our own.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.200
If we don't do this now,

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.000
it's gonna be done to us later.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.040
That's the fact.
That won't be pretty.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.360
You're saying
they'll come for me.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.760
We would protect you.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.880
Maybe Tony's right.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.360
If we have one
hand on the wheel,

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.560
we can still steer.
If we take it off...

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.360
Aren't you the same woman
who told the government

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.960
to kiss her ass a few years ago?

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.480
I'm just reading the terrain.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.840
We have made some
very public mistakes.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.040
We need to win their trust back.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.320
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.480
or did you agree with me?
I want to take it back now.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.640
No, you can't retract it.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.680
Thank you. Unprecedented.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.040
Okay. Case closed. I win.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.720
I have to go.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.360
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.200
to come up and say a few words.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.360
Margaret Carter
was known to most

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.960
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.080
but I just knew
her as Aunt Peggy.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.280
She had a photograph
in her office.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.480
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.320
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.920
But it was a lot to live up to.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.480
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.880
I asked her once how she managed

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.880
to master diplomacy
and espionage...

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.520
in a time when no
one wanted to see

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.400
a woman succeed at either.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.800
She said, compromise
where you can.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.840
But where you can't, don't.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.040
Even if everyone is telling you

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.280
that something wrong
is something right.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.720
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.520
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.160
look them in the eye
and say "No, you move."

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.040
When I came out of the ice,

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.520
I thought everyone I
had known was gone.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.480
Then I found out she was alive.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.000
I was just lucky to have her.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.960
She had you back, too.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.880
Who else signed?

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.480
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.360
Clint?

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.800
Says he's retired.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.720
Wanda? TBD.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.200
I'm off to Vienna for the
signing of the Accords.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.000
There's plenty
of room on the jet.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.720
Just because it's the
path of least resistance...

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.080
doesn't mean it's
the wrong path.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.600
Staying together
is more important

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.200
than how we stay together.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.080
What are we giving up to do it?

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.560
I'm sorry, Nat.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.400
I can't sign it.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.880
I know.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.760
Then what are you doing here?

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.880
I didn't want you to be alone.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.760
Come here.

00:23:50.073 --> 00:23:51.393
Dr. Pym?

00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:53.873
Yes. I'm still alive.

00:24:00.953 --> 00:24:01.993
ID?

00:24:03.553 --> 00:24:05.513
Perhaps that will suffice.

00:24:07.673 --> 00:24:09.753
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

00:24:12.073 --> 00:24:14.033
Is that Hank Pym?

00:24:18.113 --> 00:24:19.393
Good morning, Hank.

00:24:20.673 --> 00:24:21.673
Hope.

00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:24.233
Would it kill you
to call me Dad?

00:24:25.073 --> 00:24:26.513
Dr.
Cross will be so pleased that

00:24:26.673 --> 00:24:28.073
you could find the
time to join us today.

00:24:28.593 --> 00:24:30.553
More like "thrilled."

00:24:31.353 --> 00:24:35.113
I was surprised to receive any
kind of invitation from you, Darren.

00:24:35.233 --> 00:24:36.593
What's the occasion?

00:24:36.673 --> 00:24:38.593
Oh, you'll see. Won't he, Hope?

00:24:43.113 --> 00:24:44.793
We're ready for you inside.

00:24:45.793 --> 00:24:46.993
Ouch.

00:24:48.073 --> 00:24:51.513
I guess some old
wounds never heal, huh?

00:24:51.593 --> 00:24:53.273
Don't worry, she's
in good hands.

00:24:55.033 --> 00:24:57.193
You're in for a treat.

00:24:59.753 --> 00:25:03.673
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

00:25:04.313 --> 00:25:05.953
How's your face?

00:25:08.953 --> 00:25:10.713
After you.

00:25:18.353 --> 00:25:21.553
Now, before we start, I'd like to
introduce a very special guest.

00:25:21.633 --> 00:25:23.993
This company's
founder and my mentor,

00:25:24.673 --> 00:25:25.673
Dr. Hank Pym.

00:25:41.313 --> 00:25:43.273
When I took over this
company for Dr. Pym,

00:25:43.353 --> 00:25:45.553
I immediately started
researching a particle

00:25:45.633 --> 00:25:48.393
that could change the
distance between atoms,

00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:51.273
while increasing
density and strength.

00:25:51.833 --> 00:25:54.873
Why this revolutionary
idea remained buried

00:25:54.953 --> 00:25:57.073
beneath the dust and cobwebs of

00:25:57.193 --> 00:25:59.273
Hank's research,
I couldn't tell you.

00:25:59.353 --> 00:26:01.273
But just imagine,

00:26:01.353 --> 00:26:05.593
a soldier the size of an insect.

00:26:09.113 --> 00:26:10.593
The ultimate secret weapon.

00:26:22.553 --> 00:26:24.553
An Ant-Man.

00:26:25.953 --> 00:26:27.913
That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

00:26:32.273 --> 00:26:33.713
Silly, I know.

00:26:33.793 --> 00:26:35.273
Propaganda.

00:26:35.713 --> 00:26:37.433
Tales to astonish!

00:26:38.913 --> 00:26:40.873
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

00:26:40.953 --> 00:26:44.793
Hank, will you tell our
guests what you told me

00:26:44.873 --> 00:26:48.353
every single time I asked you,

00:26:49.993 --> 00:26:52.473
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

00:26:52.553 --> 00:26:54.153
Just a tall tale.

00:26:54.273 --> 00:26:55.313
Right.

00:26:55.393 --> 00:26:58.473
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

00:27:08.873 --> 00:27:12.513
Well, I was inspired by
the legend of the Ant-Man.

00:27:12.593 --> 00:27:15.433
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

00:27:15.513 --> 00:27:18.513
I thought, could it be
possible to shrink a person?

00:27:19.433 --> 00:27:20.993
Could that be done?

00:27:21.953 --> 00:27:25.833
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

00:27:27.473 --> 00:27:28.793
Distinguished guests,

00:27:29.513 --> 00:27:33.353
I am proud to present the
end of warfare as we know it.

00:27:33.433 --> 00:27:35.193
The Yellowjacket!

00:27:41.193 --> 00:27:42.353
Oh, no.

00:27:42.433 --> 00:27:45.713
The Yellowjacket is an
all-purpose weapon of war

00:27:46.233 --> 00:27:48.793
capable of altering
the size of the wearer

00:27:48.873 --> 00:27:50.993
for the ultimate
combat advantage.

00:27:51.673 --> 00:27:53.073
<i>We live in an era</i>

00:27:53.153 --> 00:27:55.353
<i>in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves</i>

00:27:55.433 --> 00:27:58.513
<i>are undermined by
constant surveillance.</i>

00:27:58.593 --> 00:28:00.353
<i>It's time to return
to a simpler age.</i>

00:28:00.873 --> 00:28:04.273
<i>One where the powers of freedom
can once again operate openly</i>

00:28:04.353 --> 00:28:05.633
<i>to protect their interests.</i>

00:28:06.393 --> 00:28:08.553
<i>An all-purpose
peace-keeping vessel,</i>

00:28:08.633 --> 00:28:10.953
<i>the Yellowjacket can
manage any conflict</i>

00:28:11.073 --> 00:28:12.433
<i>on the geopolitical landscape</i>

00:28:12.513 --> 00:28:14.593
<i>completely unseen.</i>

00:28:14.673 --> 00:28:18.553
<i>Efficient in both preventative
measures and tactical assault.</i>

00:28:19.313 --> 00:28:21.913
<i>Practical applications
include surveillance,</i>

00:28:21.993 --> 00:28:23.673
<i>industrial sabotage,</i>

00:28:24.473 --> 00:28:28.833
<i>and the elimination of
obstructions on the road to peace.</i>

00:28:28.913 --> 00:28:30.153
<i>A single Yellowjacket</i>

00:28:30.233 --> 00:28:32.033
<i>offers the user
unlimited influence</i>

00:28:32.153 --> 00:28:33.953
<i>to carry out protective actions.</i>

00:28:34.873 --> 00:28:37.553
<i>And, one day soon, an
army of Yellowjackets</i>

00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:40.153
<i>will create a
sustainable environment</i>

00:28:40.313 --> 00:28:42.833
<i>of well-being around the world.</i>

00:28:42.913 --> 00:28:44.833
<i>The Yellowjacket.</i>

00:28:45.713 --> 00:28:47.233
So, it's a suit?

00:28:50.713 --> 00:28:52.433
Don't be crude, Frank.

00:28:52.513 --> 00:28:55.593
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

00:28:56.273 --> 00:28:57.593
What's the matter?
You're not impressed?

00:28:57.673 --> 00:29:00.513
No, I'm impressed.
I'm also concerned.

00:29:00.593 --> 00:29:03.593
Imagine what our enemies
could do with this tech.

00:29:03.673 --> 00:29:06.273
We should have a longer
conversation about that, Frank.

00:29:06.353 --> 00:29:08.113
I really value your opinion.

00:29:09.033 --> 00:29:10.633
Thank you for coming. Hope?

00:29:11.433 --> 00:29:14.033
Thank you very much, everybody.
I will escort you out now.

00:29:14.113 --> 00:29:15.273
Thank you.

00:29:18.593 --> 00:29:20.113
You seem a bit shocked.

00:29:20.193 --> 00:29:24.433
Darren, there's a reason
that I buried these secrets.

00:29:24.513 --> 00:29:26.513
So you finally admit it!

00:29:27.313 --> 00:29:30.793
We could have done this together, Hank.
But you ruined that.

00:29:31.633 --> 00:29:33.073
That's why you're the
past and I'm the future.

00:29:33.153 --> 00:29:35.633
Don't do this.

00:29:36.153 --> 00:29:37.793
Dr. Cross?

00:29:39.113 --> 00:29:41.873
You sell to me first, 20%
over your asking price,

00:29:41.953 --> 00:29:43.833
I can have the cash
here in two weeks.

00:29:43.913 --> 00:29:45.113
Deal.

00:29:53.793 --> 00:29:55.993
We have to make our move, Hank.

00:29:56.073 --> 00:29:57.073
How close is he?

00:29:57.153 --> 00:29:59.873
He still can't
shrink a live subject.

00:29:59.953 --> 00:30:02.513
Just give me the suit and let
me finish this once and for all.

00:30:02.593 --> 00:30:03.593
No.

00:30:03.913 --> 00:30:05.713
I have Cross' complete trust.

00:30:05.793 --> 00:30:06.793
It's too dangerous.

00:30:06.913 --> 00:30:07.953
We don't have a choice.

00:30:08.513 --> 00:30:10.593
Well, that's not entirely true.

00:30:12.553 --> 00:30:14.393
I think I found a guy.

00:30:15.913 --> 00:30:17.353
Who?

00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:25.879
Why would you lock this up?

00:30:47.639 --> 00:30:49.919
This is so weird.

00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:23.279
Scotty, what's up, man?

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:30.919
I wonder... What is this?

00:32:01.279 --> 00:32:02.999
<i>The world sure seems different</i>

00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:04.839
<i>from down here,
doesn't it, Scott?</i>

00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:07.319
What? Who said that?

00:32:12.759 --> 00:32:14.639
Luis, down here!

00:32:15.319 --> 00:32:19.079
<i>It's a trial by fire, Scott.
Or, in this case,</i>

00:32:19.159 --> 00:32:20.199
<i>water.</i>

00:32:44.679 --> 00:32:46.919
<i>Guess you're tougher
than you thought.</i>

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:51.079
Oh, I don't want to see this!

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:53.039
Luis!

00:32:57.959 --> 00:32:58.959
Son of a...

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:17.479
What the hell?

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:21.039
<i>Not bad for a test drive.</i>

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:23.239
<i>Keep the suit. I'll be in touch.</i>

00:34:23.319 --> 00:34:25.479
No! No! No, thank you!

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:39.679
Get down on the ground!

00:34:39.759 --> 00:34:41.159
You are under arrest!

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:43.999
No, I didn't steal anything!
I was returning something I stole.

00:34:44.119 --> 00:34:45.119
Oh...

00:34:47.439 --> 00:34:49.039
Don't move.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.160
I'm sorry you have such deep
concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.760
Yeah. Well, uh...

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.280
Unfortunately, we can't
just do whatever we want.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.560
It'd be nice though, right?

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.080
But there are laws.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.200
What laws? Of man?

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.680
The laws of nature
transcend the laws of man.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.960
And I've transcended
the laws of nature.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.280
Darren, I don't think
you understand...

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.280
Hmm.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.840
We still haven't
worked out all the bugs.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.440
Goodbye, Frank.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.600
Thank you.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.480
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about gratitude lately.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.920
And today, during my
morning meditation,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.360
an interesting thought
occurred to me,

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.920
and I think it might
apply to you, too.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.240
How's that?

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.160
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.120
I've spent years carrying
around my anger for Hank Pym.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.800
I devoted my genius to him.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.720
I could have worked anywhere.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.040
I chose my mentor poorly.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.680
You didn't even have a choice.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.680
He never believed in you.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.920
It's a shame what we had to do,

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.360
but he forced us
to do it, didn't he?

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.720
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.400
Because his
failures as a mentor,

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.600
as a father,

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.240
forced us to spread our wings.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.040
You're a success, Darren.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.200
You deserve everything
coming your way.

00:41:16.694 --> 00:41:17.854
If we're gonna get out of here,

00:41:17.974 --> 00:41:19.734
we're gonna need to
get into that watchtower.

00:41:19.894 --> 00:41:21.614
And to do that, I'm
gonna need a few things.

00:41:22.574 --> 00:41:24.134
The guards wear security bands

00:41:24.454 --> 00:41:26.774
to control their ins and outs.
I need one.

00:41:27.134 --> 00:41:28.614
Leave it to me.

00:41:28.774 --> 00:41:31.574
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

00:41:31.694 --> 00:41:33.414
- His leg?
- Yeah.

00:41:33.574 --> 00:41:35.614
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

00:41:35.854 --> 00:41:36.974
All right.

00:41:37.134 --> 00:41:41.494
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

00:41:41.654 --> 00:41:43.614
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

00:41:43.694 --> 00:41:47.774
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

00:41:47.854 --> 00:41:49.974
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

00:41:50.054 --> 00:41:51.574
How are we supposed to do that?

00:41:51.654 --> 00:41:53.894
Well, supposably, these
bald-bodies find you attractive.

00:41:53.974 --> 00:41:55.654
So, maybe you can work
out some sort of trade.

00:41:55.734 --> 00:41:56.854
You must be joking.

00:41:56.934 --> 00:41:58.734
No, I really heard
they find you attractive.

00:41:58.814 --> 00:42:00.534
Look, it's 20
feet up in the air,

00:42:00.614 --> 00:42:02.934
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

00:42:03.014 --> 00:42:05.814
It's impossible to get up
there without being seen.

00:42:05.894 --> 00:42:06.934
I got one plan,

00:42:07.014 --> 00:42:09.094
and that plan requires
a frickin' quarnyx battery,

00:42:09.174 --> 00:42:10.414
so figure it out!

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:11.574
Oh!

00:42:11.774 --> 00:42:13.694
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

00:42:13.774 --> 00:42:15.694
Now, this is important.

00:42:15.774 --> 00:42:17.414
Once the battery is removed,

00:42:17.494 --> 00:42:19.814
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

00:42:19.894 --> 00:42:22.654
Once we have it, we
gotta move quickly,

00:42:22.734 --> 00:42:25.654
so you definitely
need to get that last.

00:42:31.174 --> 00:42:33.494
Or we could just get
it first and improvise.

00:42:33.574 --> 00:42:35.654
- I'll get the armband.
- Leg.

00:42:47.694 --> 00:42:48.694
<i>Prisoner,</i>

00:42:48.894 --> 00:42:51.734
drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

00:42:51.854 --> 00:42:53.734
or we will open fire.

00:42:59.774 --> 00:43:01.814
I am

00:43:01.934 --> 00:43:04.734
Groot!

00:43:04.854 --> 00:43:06.134
Fire!

00:43:18.814 --> 00:43:21.094
All prisoners return
to your sleeping areas.

00:43:26.854 --> 00:43:28.094
You idiot!

00:43:28.174 --> 00:43:30.974
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

00:43:37.134 --> 00:43:38.774
The animal is in control.

00:43:38.934 --> 00:43:40.934
Fire on my command!

00:44:00.294 --> 00:44:01.774
Creepy little beast!

00:44:08.214 --> 00:44:11.294
Oh, yeah.

00:44:23.254 --> 00:44:25.094
You need my what?

00:44:41.214 --> 00:44:42.814
- I'll need this.
- Good luck.

00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:44.294
It's internally wired.

00:44:44.614 --> 00:44:46.094
I'll figure something out.

00:44:49.734 --> 00:44:51.214
Drop the leg!

00:44:51.294 --> 00:44:53.974
Drop the leg and
move back to your cell!

00:45:08.894 --> 00:45:10.174
Rocket!

00:45:13.014 --> 00:45:15.334
Move to the watchtower!

00:45:46.294 --> 00:45:47.334
You!

00:45:48.334 --> 00:45:50.014
Man who has lain
with an A'askavariian!

00:45:51.334 --> 00:45:53.414
It was one time, man.

00:45:55.214 --> 00:45:57.854
We need all available
guards in full combat gear...

00:46:13.174 --> 00:46:14.254
Whoa!

00:46:20.214 --> 00:46:21.774
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

00:46:22.894 --> 00:46:23.934
Why is this one here?

00:46:24.374 --> 00:46:26.934
We promised him he could stay
by your side until he kills your boss.

00:46:27.094 --> 00:46:28.254
I always keep my promises,

00:46:28.334 --> 00:46:30.014
when they're to
muscle-bound whack-jobs

00:46:30.094 --> 00:46:31.294
who will kill me if I don't.
Here you go.

00:46:32.134 --> 00:46:33.854
Oh, I was just
kidding about the leg.

00:46:33.934 --> 00:46:35.014
I just need these two things.

00:46:35.094 --> 00:46:36.854
- What?
- No, I thought it'd be funny.

00:46:36.934 --> 00:46:37.974
Was it funny?

00:46:38.094 --> 00:46:39.854
Oh, wait, what did he
look like hopping around?

00:46:39.934 --> 00:46:41.854
I had to transfer
him 30,000 units!

00:46:44.774 --> 00:46:45.894
How are we going to leave?

00:46:47.934 --> 00:46:49.374
Well, he's got a plan.

00:46:49.694 --> 00:46:51.214
Right?
Or is that another thing you made up?

00:46:51.294 --> 00:46:52.974
I have a plan! I have a plan!

00:46:53.094 --> 00:46:54.734
Cease your yammering

00:46:54.854 --> 00:46:56.294
and relieve us from this
irksome confinement.

00:46:56.454 --> 00:46:57.934
Yeah, I'll have to agree
with the walking thesaurus

00:46:58.054 --> 00:46:59.854
on that one.

00:46:59.934 --> 00:47:02.294
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

00:47:03.134 --> 00:47:04.174
It's just a metaphor, dude.

00:47:04.294 --> 00:47:07.214
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

00:47:07.294 --> 00:47:08.974
Nothing goes over my head.

00:47:09.134 --> 00:47:12.174
My reflexes are too fast.
I would catch it.

00:47:12.934 --> 00:47:16.814
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

00:47:22.974 --> 00:47:24.214
Those are some big guns.

00:47:25.494 --> 00:47:26.814
On my command!

00:47:27.734 --> 00:47:28.734
Number one!

00:47:30.494 --> 00:47:31.494
Rodent, we are
ready for your plan.

00:47:31.814 --> 00:47:33.454
Hold on!

00:47:34.494 --> 00:47:36.334
Number two!

00:47:37.214 --> 00:47:39.054
I recognize this animal.

00:47:39.134 --> 00:47:41.294
We'd roast them over
a flame pit as children.

00:47:41.374 --> 00:47:42.774
Their flesh was quite delicious.

00:47:42.894 --> 00:47:44.014
Not helping!

00:47:44.174 --> 00:47:45.174
Number three!

00:47:51.294 --> 00:47:54.054
All fire on my command!

00:47:54.374 --> 00:47:55.494
Three!

00:47:56.054 --> 00:47:57.214
Two!

00:47:57.774 --> 00:47:58.894
One!

00:48:13.214 --> 00:48:15.054
He turned off the
artificial gravity,

00:48:15.174 --> 00:48:17.134
everywhere but in here.

00:48:55.894 --> 00:48:57.814
I told you I had a plan.

00:49:20.374 --> 00:49:21.614
That was a pretty good plan.

00:49:22.094 --> 00:49:23.134
Huh?

00:49:33.094 --> 00:49:34.294
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

00:49:34.574 --> 00:49:37.294
It's the <i>Milano,</i> the orange
and blue one over in the corner.

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:39.174
They crumpled my
pants up into a ball.

00:49:39.294 --> 00:49:41.294
That's rude! They folded yours.

00:49:49.534 --> 00:49:51.454
The Orb's there. Let's go.

00:49:51.654 --> 00:49:54.254
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

00:49:54.334 --> 00:49:56.134
That bastard didn't put it back.

00:49:56.454 --> 00:49:59.134
- Put what back?
- Here.

00:49:59.254 --> 00:50:01.014
Get them to the ship.
I will be right back.

00:50:01.094 --> 00:50:03.574
- How are you gonna possibly...
- Just keep the <i>Milano</i> close by.

00:50:03.654 --> 00:50:05.054
Go.

00:50:05.174 --> 00:50:06.414
Go!

00:50:26.614 --> 00:50:28.494
Ah, my neck!

00:50:33.254 --> 00:50:34.494
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

00:50:35.054 --> 00:50:37.014
He declined to share
that information with me.

00:50:37.094 --> 00:50:38.094
Well, screw this, then!

00:50:38.934 --> 00:50:41.014
I ain't waiting around for
some humie with a death wish.

00:50:41.094 --> 00:50:42.374
You got the Orb, right?

00:50:42.494 --> 00:50:44.134
Yes.

00:51:06.654 --> 00:51:09.414
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

00:51:09.494 --> 00:51:10.454
No!

00:51:10.534 --> 00:51:12.534
We're not leaving
without the Orb.

00:51:21.254 --> 00:51:22.534
Behold.

00:51:30.094 --> 00:51:32.214
This one shows spirit.

00:51:32.294 --> 00:51:35.214
He shall make a keen ally
in the battle against Ronan.

00:51:35.334 --> 00:51:37.654
Companion, what
were you retrieving?

00:51:44.054 --> 00:51:45.494
You're an imbecile.

00:51:49.837 --> 00:51:52.757
<i>At a special United
Nations conference...</i>

00:51:52.837 --> 00:51:55.397
<i>117 countries have come together</i>

00:51:55.477 --> 00:51:58.157
<i>to ratify the Sokovia Accords.</i>

00:52:02.157 --> 00:52:03.637
Excuse me, Ms. Romanoff?

00:52:03.717 --> 00:52:05.317
Yes? These need your signature.

00:52:06.997 --> 00:52:08.357
Thank you. Thanks.

00:52:09.437 --> 00:52:10.997
I suppose neither of us

00:52:11.117 --> 00:52:12.837
is used to the spotlight.

00:52:14.237 --> 00:52:16.277
Oh, well, it's not
always so flattering.

00:52:16.437 --> 00:52:18.757
You seem to be
doing all right so far.

00:52:19.357 --> 00:52:21.277
Considering your
last trip to Capitol Hill...

00:52:21.797 --> 00:52:23.357
I wouldn't think
you'd be particularly

00:52:23.437 --> 00:52:25.277
comfortable in this company.

00:52:25.357 --> 00:52:26.477
Well, I'm not.

00:52:26.557 --> 00:52:29.397
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms. Romanoff.

00:52:29.557 --> 00:52:31.357
Why?
You don't approve of all this?

00:52:31.437 --> 00:52:34.877
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.

00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:38.797
Two people in a room can
get more done than a hundred.

00:52:38.957 --> 00:52:41.237
Unless you need to move a piano.

00:52:43.757 --> 00:52:44.797
Ms. Romanoff.

00:52:44.957 --> 00:52:45.957
King T'Chaka.

00:52:46.637 --> 00:52:48.877
Please, allow me to apologize
for what happened in Nigeria.

00:52:49.037 --> 00:52:50.597
Thank you.

00:52:50.757 --> 00:52:53.117
Thank you for
agreeing to all of this.

00:52:53.277 --> 00:52:54.877
I'm sad to hear
that Captain Rogers

00:52:54.997 --> 00:52:56.397
will not be joining us today.

00:52:56.637 --> 00:52:57.797
Yes, so am I.

00:52:57.997 --> 00:52:59.477
<i>If everyone could
please be seated.</i>

00:52:59.557 --> 00:53:01.317
<i>This assembly is now in session.</i>

00:53:02.317 --> 00:53:03.437
That is the future calling.

00:53:05.317 --> 00:53:06.437
Such a pleasure.

00:53:06.757 --> 00:53:07.917
Thank you.

00:53:25.997 --> 00:53:28.437
<i>When stolen Wakandan vibranium</i>

00:53:28.517 --> 00:53:31.437
<i>was used to make
a terrible weapon...</i>

00:53:31.517 --> 00:53:35.477
<i>we in Wakanda were
forced to question our legacy.</i>

00:53:36.157 --> 00:53:38.357
Those men and
women killed in Nigeria...

00:53:38.517 --> 00:53:40.437
were part of a goodwill mission

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:42.677
from a country too
long in the shadows.

00:53:43.877 --> 00:53:48.117
We will not, however, let
misfortune drive us back.

00:53:48.197 --> 00:53:51.877
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.

00:53:52.357 --> 00:53:54.637
I am grateful to the Avengers

00:53:54.717 --> 00:53:56.277
for supporting this initiative.

00:53:58.317 --> 00:54:00.357
Wakanda is proud

00:54:00.517 --> 00:54:02.357
to extend its hand in peace.

00:54:02.557 --> 00:54:03.557
Everybody get down!
