WEBVTT

00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:24.891
What is it?

00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:26.491
Stay here, please.

00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:34.611
Guess I shoulda knocked.

00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:38.211
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.931
Disappointing my kids.

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:45.971
I'm supposed to go
waterskiing.

00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:48.251
Cap needs our help. Come on.

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:49.611
Clint!

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.851
You should not be here.

00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:56.451
Really?

00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:58.691
I retire for, what,
like five minutes,

00:00:58.771 --> 00:00:59.811
and it all
goes to shit.

00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:02.371
Please consider
the consequences
of your actions.

00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:03.571
Okay, they're considered.

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:06.411
Okay, we gotta go.

00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:12.171
It's this way.

00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:14.531
I've caused
enough problems.

00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:20.571
You gotta help me, Wanda.

00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:22.451
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:24.771
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:26.851
Shit.

00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:35.011
I knew I should've stretched.

00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:51.131
Clint,
you can't overpower me.

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:53.131
I know I can't.

00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:55.291
But she can.

00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:59.891
Vision, that's enough.
Let him go.

00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:01.771
I'm leaving.

00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:03.091
I can't let you.

00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:09.451
I'm sorry.

00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:14.811
If you do this...

00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:18.251
they will never stop
being afraid of you.

00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:23.131
I can't control their fear,
only my own.

00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:36.531
Oh...

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.811
Come on. We got
one more stop.

00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:49.731
Strange!

00:03:52.251 --> 00:03:53.491
You're okay.

00:03:53.731 --> 00:03:55.851
A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.371
The Cloak of Levitation.

00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.891
It came to you.

00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:03.091
No minor feat.

00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:05.411
It's a fickle thing.

00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:07.651
- He's escaped.
- Kaecilius?

00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:08.931
Yeah.

00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:11.731
He can fold space and matter at will.

00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:15.371
He folds matter
outside the Mirror Dimension...

00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:16.611
in the real world?

00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:17.771
Yeah.

00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:19.771
-How many more?
-Two.

00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:22.851
I stranded one in the desert.

00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:24.051
And the other?

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.531
His body's in the hall.

00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:27.451
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:29.331
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:30.771
The London Sanctum has fallen.

00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.291
Only New York and Hong Kong
remain now...

00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:35.571
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:39.211
You defended the New York Sanctum
from attack.

00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:41.211
With its master gone, it needs another.

00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:42.891
Master Strange.

00:04:45.771 --> 00:04:46.771
No.

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:49.971
It is Doctor Strange.

00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:52.731
Not Master Strange. Not Mister Strange.

00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:53.971
Doctor Strange.

00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:58.891
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:00.331
And I have just killed a man!

00:05:00.411 --> 00:05:02.251
I'm not doing that again.

00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:04.771
I became a doctor
to save lives, not take them.

00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:08.211
You became a doctor
to save one life above all others.

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:09.291
Your own.

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.491
Still seeing through me, are you?

00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:16.331
I see what I've always seen:
your over-inflated ego.

00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:20.091
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything...

00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:21.571
even death...

00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:23.331
which no one can control.

00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:26.171
Not even the great
Doctor Stephen Strange.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.531
Not even Dormammu?

00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:32.011
He offers immortality.

00:05:32.211 --> 00:05:34.211
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:35.611
He feeds off it.

00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:38.011
Like you feed off him?

00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:39.931
You talk to me about controlling death?

00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:41.091
Oh, I know how you do it.

00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:43.971
I've seen the missing rituals
from <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.891
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:49.851
Because you might not like them?

00:05:50.211 --> 00:05:53.011
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

00:05:53.211 --> 00:05:54.731
What is he talking about?

00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:58.211
I'm talking about her long life,
the source of her immortality.

00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:01.611
She draws power
from the Dark Dimension

00:06:01.891 --> 00:06:03.251
to stay alive.

00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:06.331
That's not true.

00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.731
I've seen the rituals. Worked them out.

00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:11.011
I know how you do it.

00:06:12.731 --> 00:06:14.131
Once they regroup...

00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:15.891
the Zealots will be back.

00:06:16.571 --> 00:06:18.411
You'll need reinforcements.

00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:27.411
She's not who you think she is.

00:06:27.611 --> 00:06:29.411
You don't have the right to say that.

00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:32.291
You've no idea the responsibility
that rests upon her shoulders.

00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:34.251
No, and I don't want to know.

00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:35.731
You're a coward.

00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:37.171
Because I'm not a killer?

00:06:37.411 --> 00:06:38.931
These Zealots will snuff us all out...

00:06:39.011 --> 00:06:41.571
and you can't muster the strength
to snuff them first?

00:06:41.731 --> 00:06:43.091
What do you think I just did?

00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:44.491
You saved your own life!

00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:48.411
And then whined about it
like a wounded dog.

00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:49.891
Oh, you would have done it so easily?

00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:52.771
You've no idea the things I've done.

00:06:54.971 --> 00:06:56.851
And the answer is yes.

00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:58.651
Without hesitation.

00:06:58.891 --> 00:06:59.971
Even if there's another way?

00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:01.971
There is no other way.

00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:03.451
You lack imagination.

00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:04.611
No, Stephen.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:08.331
You lack a spine.

00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:14.611
They're back.

00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:22.771
We have to end this.

00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:24.051
Now!

00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:30.371
Strange!

00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:32.211
Get down here and fight!

00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:33.651
No!

00:07:38.051 --> 00:07:39.331
The Mirror Dimension.

00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:42.331
You can't affect the real world in here.

00:07:42.811 --> 00:07:44.131
Who's laughing now?

00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:45.491
Asshole.

00:07:47.371 --> 00:07:48.411
I am.

00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:03.651
I've got his sling ring.

00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:04.771
They can't escape, right?

00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:07.251
Run!

00:08:24.491 --> 00:08:26.051
Their connection
to the Dark Dimension

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.051
makes them more powerful
in the Mirror Dimension.

00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:30.451
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:33.371
This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!

00:08:50.011 --> 00:08:52.211
That is hilarious.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.171
This was a mistake.

00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:55.091
Whoa.

00:10:43.611 --> 00:10:44.611
Oh!

00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:13.771
It's true.

00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:18.011
She does draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:22.611
Kaecilius.

00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:28.251
I came to you broken...

00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:31.211
lost, in need.

00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:34.251
Trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

00:11:34.691 --> 00:11:36.211
I tried to protect you.

00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:38.731
-From the truth?
-From yourself.

00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:41.091
I have a new teacher now.

00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:42.611
Dormammu deceives you.

00:11:43.571 --> 00:11:45.891
You have no idea what he truly is.

00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:49.891
His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.

00:11:50.051 --> 00:11:51.331
Liar.

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:51.613
It's just
a matter of time.

00:12:51.773 --> 00:12:54.533
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,

00:12:54.613 --> 00:12:56.253
and behavioral pattern scans.

00:13:00.413 --> 00:13:02.973
Move or you will be moved.

00:13:04.253 --> 00:13:06.933
As entertaining
as that would be...

00:13:07.093 --> 00:13:09.253
You really think
you can find him?

00:13:09.773 --> 00:13:11.413
My resources are
considerable.

00:13:11.613 --> 00:13:13.973
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...

00:13:14.053 --> 00:13:16.573
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

00:13:17.773 --> 00:13:19.453
You know where they are.

00:13:19.613 --> 00:13:21.693
I know someone who does.

00:13:24.373 --> 00:13:26.893
Not sure you
understand the concept
of a getaway car.

00:13:27.053 --> 00:13:28.093
It's low profile.

00:13:28.693 --> 00:13:31.453
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

00:13:33.293 --> 00:13:34.773
Can you move
your seat up?

00:13:34.973 --> 00:13:36.013
No.

00:13:36.293 --> 00:13:37.413
I owe you again.

00:13:38.013 --> 00:13:39.573
Keeping a list.

00:13:42.693 --> 00:13:44.493
You know, he kinda
tried to kill me.

00:13:45.373 --> 00:13:48.093
Sorry. I'll put it
on the list, too.

00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:53.693
They're going to come
looking for you.

00:13:53.853 --> 00:13:54.893
I know.

00:13:57.533 --> 00:13:58.893
Thank you, Sharon.

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:15.453
That was...

00:14:15.613 --> 00:14:16.613
Late.

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:17.773
Damn right.

00:14:22.133 --> 00:14:23.133
I should go.

00:14:23.293 --> 00:14:24.293
Okay.

00:14:48.773 --> 00:14:50.013
Cap.

00:14:50.173 --> 00:14:51.253
You know I wouldn't
have called

00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:52.413
if I had any other choice.

00:14:52.493 --> 00:14:53.853
Hey, man,
you're doing me a favor.

00:14:54.013 --> 00:14:56.373
Besides, I owe a debt.

00:14:56.533 --> 00:14:58.093
Thanks for having
my back.

00:14:58.253 --> 00:14:59.773
It was time to
get off my ass.

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:01.973
How about our
other recruit?

00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:03.693
He's rarin' to go.

00:15:04.493 --> 00:15:05.693
Had to put a little
coffee in him...

00:15:07.053 --> 00:15:08.213
but he should be good.

00:15:11.533 --> 00:15:13.053
What time zone is this?

00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:15.053
Come on. Come on.

00:15:18.173 --> 00:15:20.093
Captain America!
Mr. Lang.

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:22.253
It's an honor.

00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:24.453
I'm shaking
your hand too long.

00:15:24.613 --> 00:15:25.853
Wow! This is awesome!

00:15:26.013 --> 00:15:28.653
Captain America.
I know you, too.
You're great!

00:15:32.413 --> 00:15:33.413
Jeez.

00:15:33.573 --> 00:15:35.373
Ah, look, I wanna say,

00:15:35.453 --> 00:15:37.533
I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

00:15:38.493 --> 00:15:40.333
thinks for thanking of me.

00:15:40.493 --> 00:15:42.373
Hey, man!
What's up, Tic Tac?

00:15:42.533 --> 00:15:43.533
Uh, good to see you.

00:15:43.613 --> 00:15:45.053
Look, what happened
last time when I...

00:15:45.213 --> 00:15:48.453
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.

00:15:48.813 --> 00:15:50.893
They tell you what
we're up against?

00:15:51.173 --> 00:15:54.253
Something about
some psycho-assassins?

00:15:54.573 --> 00:15:56.573
We're outside the law
on this one.

00:15:56.733 --> 00:15:58.693
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.

00:15:59.213 --> 00:16:00.653
Yeah, well, what else is new?

00:16:00.813 --> 00:16:01.853
We should get moving.

00:16:01.933 --> 00:16:03.733
We got a chopper lined up.

00:16:08.253 --> 00:16:10.053
They're evacuating
the airport.

00:16:10.253 --> 00:16:11.333
Stark.

00:16:11.493 --> 00:16:12.493
Stark?

00:16:13.853 --> 00:16:15.453
Suit up.

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:17.931
Christine!

00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:20.331
Are you kidding me?

00:16:21.491 --> 00:16:22.491
Oh, my God.

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:27.251
It's not fibrillation.
She has a stunned myocardium.

00:16:27.331 --> 00:16:28.451
- Neurogenic?
- Yes.

00:16:33.571 --> 00:16:34.771
Someone get the swabs.

00:16:37.291 --> 00:16:38.291
Nic?

00:16:41.611 --> 00:16:43.251
We need to relieve
the pressure on her brain.

00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:48.131
She's still dropping.

00:16:48.211 --> 00:16:49.251
We're losing her!

00:16:49.331 --> 00:16:50.571
We need to increase her oxygen!

00:16:50.731 --> 00:16:51.731
I need a crash cart!

00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:52.851
Her pupils have dilated!

00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:54.571
No reflexes.

00:16:54.691 --> 00:16:56.091
We're not reading any brain activity.

00:17:07.771 --> 00:17:09.251
What are you doing?

00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:11.931
Come on, you're dying!

00:17:20.611 --> 00:17:23.171
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:24.931
Time is relative.

00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:27.331
Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

00:17:29.251 --> 00:17:31.051
I've spent so many years...

00:17:31.131 --> 00:17:32.811
peering through time...

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:35.491
looking at this exact moment.

00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:37.211
But I can't see past it.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.371
I've prevented countless,
terrible futures.

00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:44.051
And after each one,
there's always another.

00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:46.531
And they all lead here...

00:17:46.651 --> 00:17:47.651
but never further.

00:17:47.891 --> 00:17:49.811
You think this is where you die.

00:17:50.771 --> 00:17:53.131
You wonder what I see in your future?

00:17:53.211 --> 00:17:54.371
No.

00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:57.731
Yes.

00:17:57.811 --> 00:17:59.331
I never saw your future.

00:17:59.651 --> 00:18:01.971
Only its possibilities.

00:18:02.051 --> 00:18:04.771
You have such a capacity for goodness.

00:18:04.971 --> 00:18:06.811
You always excelled...

00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:09.411
but not because you craved success...

00:18:09.491 --> 00:18:11.971
but because of your fear of failure.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.811
That's what made me a great doctor.

00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:16.611
It's precisely what kept you
from greatness.

00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:19.731
Arrogance and fear still keep you...

00:18:19.851 --> 00:18:21.251
from learning the simplest

00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:23.371
and most significant lesson of all.

00:18:23.451 --> 00:18:24.451
Which is?

00:18:26.691 --> 00:18:28.931
It's not about you.

00:18:32.691 --> 00:18:34.011
When you first came to me...

00:18:34.091 --> 00:18:37.251
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

00:18:38.291 --> 00:18:39.571
I didn't.

00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:45.691
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:47.651
He uses magic to walk?

00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:48.851
Constantly.

00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:51.331
He had a choice...

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:54.091
to return to his own life...

00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:56.971
or to serve something
greater than himself.

00:18:57.051 --> 00:18:59.691
So I could have my hands back again?

00:18:59.811 --> 00:19:01.211
My old life?

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.131
You could.

00:19:04.211 --> 00:19:07.011
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

00:19:08.531 --> 00:19:11.891
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:13.131
But as you well know...

00:19:13.211 --> 00:19:15.611
sometimes one must break the rules...

00:19:15.691 --> 00:19:17.491
in order to serve the greater good.

00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:19.651
Mordo won't see it that way.

00:19:19.731 --> 00:19:22.331
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...

00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:24.651
forged by the fires of his youth.

00:19:24.891 --> 00:19:26.651
He needs your flexibility...

00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:28.731
just as you need his strength.

00:19:29.891 --> 00:19:33.571
Only together do you stand a chance
of stopping Dormammu.

00:19:33.811 --> 00:19:35.251
I'm not ready.

00:19:37.371 --> 00:19:38.731
No one ever is.

00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:42.611
We don't get to choose our time.

00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:48.971
Death is what gives life meaning.

00:19:50.091 --> 00:19:52.691
To know your days are numbered.

00:19:52.771 --> 00:19:54.811
Your time is short.

00:19:56.771 --> 00:19:59.051
You'd think after
all this time, I'd be ready.

00:20:00.011 --> 00:20:01.731
But look at me.

00:20:01.811 --> 00:20:04.811
Stretching one moment out
into a thousand...

00:20:05.051 --> 00:20:07.411
just so that I can watch the snow.

00:20:46.131 --> 00:20:47.571
Are you okay?

00:20:55.371 --> 00:20:57.491
I don't understand what's happening.

00:20:57.651 --> 00:20:58.731
I know.

00:20:59.531 --> 00:21:02.411
But I have to go away now.

00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:10.211
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end.

00:21:10.291 --> 00:21:11.971
That it could be a beginning.

00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:13.211
Yeah.

00:21:14.731 --> 00:21:17.411
Because there are other ways
to save lives.

00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:22.051
A harder way.

00:21:24.291 --> 00:21:26.571
A weirder way.

00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:28.571
<i>Doctor Palmer</i>
<i>to the ER, please.</i>

00:21:28.651 --> 00:21:30.291
<i>Doctor Palmer to the ER.</i>

00:21:34.571 --> 00:21:36.411
I don't want you to go.

00:22:24.184 --> 00:22:25.344
Stop!

00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:50.106
<i>Wow, it's so weird</i>

00:22:50.186 --> 00:22:51.186
<i>how you run</i>
<i>into people at the airport.</i>

00:22:51.266 --> 00:22:52.906
- Don't you think that's weird?
<i>- Definitely weird.</i>

00:22:52.986 --> 00:22:54.266
Hear me out, Tony.

00:22:54.346 --> 00:22:57.306
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.

00:23:00.826 --> 00:23:01.866
<i>Captain.</i>

00:23:02.026 --> 00:23:03.066
Your Highness.

00:23:03.546 --> 00:23:04.546
Anyway...

00:23:04.986 --> 00:23:06.986
Ross gave me 36 hours
to bring you in.

00:23:07.186 --> 00:23:10.066
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?

00:23:10.266 --> 00:23:11.586
You're after
the wrong guy.

00:23:11.746 --> 00:23:13.826
Your judgment is askew.

00:23:14.506 --> 00:23:16.386
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.

00:23:16.546 --> 00:23:19.386
And there are five
more super soldiers
just like him.

00:23:19.546 --> 00:23:22.026
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony.
I can't.

00:23:22.186 --> 00:23:23.266
Steve...

00:23:24.346 --> 00:23:26.346
you know what's
about to happen.

00:23:26.506 --> 00:23:28.866
Do you really wanna punch
your way out of this one?

00:23:32.866 --> 00:23:34.866
All right, I've run out
of patience.

00:23:35.026 --> 00:23:36.026
Underoos!

00:23:41.866 --> 00:23:43.706
- Nice job, kid.
- Thanks.

00:23:43.866 --> 00:23:45.706
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...

00:23:45.866 --> 00:23:47.706
New suit.
It's nothing, Mr. Stark.

00:23:47.866 --> 00:23:49.026
It's perfect. Thank you.

00:23:49.186 --> 00:23:50.866
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.

00:23:51.026 --> 00:23:52.066
Okay. Cap. Captain.

00:23:53.226 --> 00:23:54.586
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.

00:23:54.746 --> 00:23:55.866
Yeah, we'll talk
about it later.

00:23:56.386 --> 00:23:57.626
- Hey, everyone.
- Good job.

00:23:58.106 --> 00:23:59.106
You've been busy.

00:23:59.226 --> 00:24:01.306
And you've been
a complete idiot.

00:24:01.386 --> 00:24:02.426
Dragging in Clint...

00:24:02.546 --> 00:24:03.986
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place

00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:06.226
she doesn't even want
to leave, a safe place.

00:24:06.386 --> 00:24:07.586
I'm trying to keep...

00:24:08.906 --> 00:24:11.986
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.

00:24:12.426 --> 00:24:14.746
You did that
when you signed.

00:24:15.746 --> 00:24:16.906
All right, we're done.

00:24:17.586 --> 00:24:19.066
You're gonna turn Barnes over,

00:24:19.146 --> 00:24:21.426
you're gonna come with us,
now, because it's us...

00:24:21.906 --> 00:24:23.226
or a squad of J-SOC guys...

00:24:23.426 --> 00:24:26.066
with no compunction
about being impolite.

00:24:28.066 --> 00:24:29.266
Come on.

00:24:30.346 --> 00:24:31.946
<i>We found it.</i>

00:24:33.266 --> 00:24:35.426
Their Quinjet's in
hangar five, north runway.

00:24:39.466 --> 00:24:40.586
All right, Lang.

00:24:41.826 --> 00:24:43.186
Hey, guys, something...

00:24:44.026 --> 00:24:45.066
Whoa.
What the hell was that?

00:24:45.146 --> 00:24:47.266
<i>I believe this is yours,</i>
<i>Captain America.</i>

00:24:47.426 --> 00:24:48.426
Oh, great.

00:24:48.586 --> 00:24:49.826
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.

00:24:49.946 --> 00:24:51.266
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.

00:24:51.426 --> 00:24:52.826
<i>Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?</i>

00:24:52.986 --> 00:24:55.026
<i>Got two in the terminal,</i>
<i>Wilson and Barnes.</i>

00:24:55.186 --> 00:24:56.186
<i>Barnes is mine.</i>

00:24:57.666 --> 00:24:58.986
Hey, Mr. Stark,
what should I do?

00:24:59.106 --> 00:25:00.066
What we discussed.

00:25:00.146 --> 00:25:01.146
Keep your distance,
web them up.

00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:02.466
Okay, copy that.

00:25:07.346 --> 00:25:08.826
<i>Move, Captain.</i>

00:25:08.986 --> 00:25:10.786
<i>I won't ask a second time.</i>

00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:14.546
<i>Look, I really don't</i>
<i>want to hurt you.</i>

00:25:15.106 --> 00:25:16.546
I wouldn't stress about it.

00:25:28.786 --> 00:25:30.146
What the hell
is that?

00:25:30.306 --> 00:25:32.346
Everyone's got
a gimmick now.

00:25:38.906 --> 00:25:40.306
You have a metal arm?

00:25:40.466 --> 00:25:41.986
That is awesome, dude.

00:25:43.746 --> 00:25:45.146
You have the right
to remain silent!

00:25:59.866 --> 00:26:01.186
<i>Sorry, Cap,</i>
<i>this won't kill you...</i>

00:26:01.346 --> 00:26:02.586
but it ain't gonna
tickle either.

00:26:08.026 --> 00:26:09.906
<i>Wanda, I think you hurt</i>
<i>Vision's feelings.</i>

00:26:10.066 --> 00:26:11.426
You locked me
in my room.

00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:13.026
<i>Okay, first,</i>
<i>that's an exaggeration.</i>

00:26:13.186 --> 00:26:15.506
<i>Second, I did it</i>
<i>to protect you.</i>

00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:17.026
<i>Hey, Clint.</i>
Hey, man.

00:26:17.186 --> 00:26:18.906
<i>Clearly,</i>
<i>retirement doesn't suit you.</i>

00:26:19.066 --> 00:26:20.546
<i>You got tired of</i>
<i>shooting golf?</i>

00:26:20.706 --> 00:26:23.066
Well, I played 18, shot 18.

00:26:24.026 --> 00:26:25.186
Just can't seem to miss.

00:26:27.866 --> 00:26:29.106
<i>First time for everything.</i>

00:26:29.266 --> 00:26:30.386
Made you look.

00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:42.546
<i>Multiple</i>
<i>contusions detected.</i>

00:26:42.706 --> 00:26:44.386
Yeah, I detected that, too.

00:26:52.226 --> 00:26:53.266
Oh, God!

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:56.226
Hey, buddy,
I think you lost this!

00:27:01.746 --> 00:27:02.906
Ahh!

00:27:08.266 --> 00:27:09.586
Those wings carbon fiber?

00:27:09.666 --> 00:27:11.066
Is this stuff
coming out of you?

00:27:11.226 --> 00:27:12.826
That would explain the
rigidity-flexibility ratio,

00:27:12.906 --> 00:27:14.346
which, gotta say,
that's awesome, man.

00:27:14.506 --> 00:27:16.066
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...

00:27:16.226 --> 00:27:17.746
but there's usually
not this much talking.

00:27:17.906 --> 00:27:18.906
All right, sorry.
My bad.

00:27:24.146 --> 00:27:25.746
Guys, look,
I'd love to
keep this up,

00:27:25.826 --> 00:27:27.466
but I've only got
one job here today...

00:27:27.626 --> 00:27:30.586
and I gotta impress Mr. Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.

00:27:34.106 --> 00:27:36.266
You couldn't have
done that earlier?

00:27:36.786 --> 00:27:38.026
I hate you.

00:27:44.546 --> 00:27:45.506
<i>Great.</i>

00:27:45.706 --> 00:27:47.266
<i>Hey, Cap, heads-up!</i>

00:27:48.826 --> 00:27:50.186
<i>Throw it at this.</i>

00:27:50.786 --> 00:27:51.826
<i>Now!</i>

00:27:55.346 --> 00:27:56.626
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

00:27:59.506 --> 00:28:02.386
<i>Oh, man,</i>
<i>I thought it was</i>
<i>a water truck.</i>

00:28:03.106 --> 00:28:04.466
<i>Uh, sorry.</i>

00:28:06.466 --> 00:28:07.866
<i>All right,</i>
<i>now I'm pissed.</i>

00:28:08.706 --> 00:28:10.066
Is this part
of the plan?

00:28:10.226 --> 00:28:11.746
<i>Well, my plan was</i>
<i>go easy on them.</i>

00:28:11.826 --> 00:28:13.066
<i>You wanna switch it up?</i>

00:28:15.546 --> 00:28:16.626
There's our ride.

00:28:18.866 --> 00:28:19.866
Come on!

00:28:28.826 --> 00:28:29.986
Captain Rogers...

00:28:30.986 --> 00:28:33.986
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.

00:28:34.746 --> 00:28:36.586
But for the collective good...

00:28:36.746 --> 00:28:39.066
you must surrender now.

00:28:56.186 --> 00:28:57.866
What do we do, Cap?

00:28:58.866 --> 00:29:00.066
We fight.

00:29:01.866 --> 00:29:03.506
This is gonna end well.

00:29:10.066 --> 00:29:11.586
They're not stopping.

00:29:11.746 --> 00:29:12.786
Neither are we.

00:29:43.826 --> 00:29:44.946
We're still friends, right?

00:29:45.106 --> 00:29:46.626
Depends on how hard
you hit me.

00:29:55.426 --> 00:29:57.426
You were pulling
your punches.

00:30:01.746 --> 00:30:03.066
I didn't kill
your father.

00:30:03.266 --> 00:30:04.546
<i>Then why did you run?</i>

00:30:23.106 --> 00:30:25.146
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.

00:30:25.266 --> 00:30:26.226
Look, kid, there's
a lot going on here

00:30:26.306 --> 00:30:27.306
that you don't understand.

00:30:27.426 --> 00:30:29.106
Mr. Stark said
you'd say that. Wow.

00:30:38.466 --> 00:30:40.506
He also said to go
for your legs.

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:48.946
Ahhh!

00:30:52.306 --> 00:30:53.626
Clint, can you get him off me?

00:30:53.786 --> 00:30:54.946
Buckled in?

00:30:55.146 --> 00:30:56.506
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

00:30:56.666 --> 00:30:58.706
<i>I'm good, Arrow Guy.</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

00:31:20.506 --> 00:31:21.826
Stark tell you
anything else?

00:31:21.986 --> 00:31:24.666
That you're wrong.
You think you're right.

00:31:25.346 --> 00:31:26.746
That makes you dangerous.

00:31:31.666 --> 00:31:33.226
Guess he had a point.

00:31:38.186 --> 00:31:40.346
You got heart, kid.
Where you from?

00:31:41.386 --> 00:31:42.386
Queens.

00:31:43.866 --> 00:31:44.866
Brooklyn.

00:31:50.786 --> 00:31:51.826
<i>Friday?</i>

00:31:51.906 --> 00:31:53.106
<i>We have some</i>
<i>weapon systems offline.</i>

00:31:53.186 --> 00:31:54.186
What?

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:56.906
<i>Oh, you're gonna have to</i>
<i>take this into the shop.</i>

00:31:57.066 --> 00:31:58.386
Who's speaking?

00:31:58.586 --> 00:32:02.266
<i>It's your conscience. We don't</i>
<i>talk a lot these days.</i>

00:32:02.466 --> 00:32:03.506
Friday?

00:32:03.586 --> 00:32:04.866
<i>Deploying fire</i>
<i>suppression system.</i>

00:32:06.026 --> 00:32:07.026
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

00:32:09.026 --> 00:32:10.026
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

00:32:12.706 --> 00:32:13.706
<i>Whoa!</i>

00:32:19.306 --> 00:32:21.426
We gotta go.
That guy's probably
in Siberia by now.

00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:22.986
We gotta draw out the flyers.

00:32:23.146 --> 00:32:24.906
I'll take Vision,
you get to the jet.

00:32:25.066 --> 00:32:26.706
No, you get to the jet!

00:32:26.906 --> 00:32:28.066
<i>Both of you!</i>

00:32:30.266 --> 00:32:31.546
The rest of us
aren't getting out of here.

00:32:31.746 --> 00:32:32.906
As much as I hate
to admit it...

00:32:33.066 --> 00:32:34.466
<i>if we're gonna win this one,</i>

00:32:34.546 --> 00:32:36.146
<i>some of us</i>
<i>might have to lose it.</i>

00:32:36.306 --> 00:32:38.386
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>the real fight, Steve.</i>

00:32:38.586 --> 00:32:40.066
All right, Sam.
What's the play?

00:32:40.226 --> 00:32:42.466
We need a diversion.
Something big.

00:32:44.106 --> 00:32:45.746
<i>I got something kinda big.</i>

00:32:45.906 --> 00:32:47.266
<i>But I can't hold it very long.</i>

00:32:47.626 --> 00:32:49.626
<i>On my signal,</i>
<i>run like hell.</i>

00:32:49.786 --> 00:32:51.106
<i>And if I tear myself</i>
<i>in half...</i>

00:32:51.306 --> 00:32:52.426
<i>don't come back for me.</i>

00:32:52.586 --> 00:32:53.546
He's gonna tear
himself in half?

00:32:53.626 --> 00:32:55.106
You sure about this, Scott?

00:32:55.266 --> 00:32:56.626
<i>I do it all the time.</i>

00:32:56.786 --> 00:32:58.626
<i>I mean, once. In a lab.</i>

00:32:58.786 --> 00:33:00.426
<i>Then I passed out.</i>

00:33:00.586 --> 00:33:02.506
<i>I'm the boss, I'm the boss,</i>
<i>I'm the boss.</i>

00:33:18.546 --> 00:33:20.146
Holy shit!

00:33:24.266 --> 00:33:26.306
Okay, tiny dude is big now.
He's big now.

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:29.466
I guess that's the signal.

00:33:29.626 --> 00:33:31.106
Way to go, Tic Tac!

00:33:32.946 --> 00:33:34.466
Give me back my Rhodey.

00:33:38.146 --> 00:33:39.306
I got him.

00:34:01.986 --> 00:34:04.506
Okay, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking

00:34:04.586 --> 00:34:06.306
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose...

00:34:06.506 --> 00:34:07.586
I'm open to suggestions.

00:34:15.706 --> 00:34:17.346
<i>You wanna get to them...</i>

00:34:17.506 --> 00:34:19.266
<i>you gotta go through me.</i>

00:34:29.586 --> 00:34:30.706
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

00:34:45.706 --> 00:34:47.106
We haven't met yet.

00:34:49.706 --> 00:34:51.426
I'm Clint.
<i>I don't care.</i>

00:35:05.546 --> 00:35:06.586
Whoa!

00:35:11.626 --> 00:35:12.626
Ahhh!

00:35:19.226 --> 00:35:20.226
Get off!

00:35:35.106 --> 00:35:36.906
<i>Something just flew in me!</i>

00:36:01.106 --> 00:36:02.186
You're not gonna stop.

00:36:02.786 --> 00:36:03.786
You know I can't.

00:36:04.706 --> 00:36:05.826
I'm gonna regret this.

00:36:09.786 --> 00:36:10.786
Go.

00:36:16.466 --> 00:36:18.506
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,

00:36:18.626 --> 00:36:20.626
<i>Empire Strikes Back?</i>

00:36:20.786 --> 00:36:22.146
<i>Jesus, Tony,</i>
<i>how old is this guy?</i>

00:36:22.306 --> 00:36:23.346
I don't know,
I didn't carbon-date him.

00:36:23.466 --> 00:36:24.546
He's on the young side.

00:36:26.506 --> 00:36:29.626
You know that part where
they're on the snow planet...

00:36:30.866 --> 00:36:32.386
with the walking thingies?

00:36:34.706 --> 00:36:35.826
Maybe the kid's
onto something.

00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:36.986
High now, Tony. Go high.

00:36:45.466 --> 00:36:46.466
Yes!

00:36:47.026 --> 00:36:48.666
That was awesome!

00:37:03.346 --> 00:37:06.386
Does anyone have
any orange slices?

00:37:11.906 --> 00:37:12.866
Kid, you all right?

00:37:13.106 --> 00:37:14.106
Whoa!

00:37:15.026 --> 00:37:18.106
Same side. Guess who.
Hi. It's me.

00:37:18.266 --> 00:37:19.346
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.

00:37:19.506 --> 00:37:20.706
- That was scary.
- Yeah.

00:37:20.906 --> 00:37:22.506
You're done, all right?

00:37:22.706 --> 00:37:23.666
What? I'm good, I'm fine.

00:37:23.746 --> 00:37:24.786
You did a good job.
Stay down.

00:37:24.866 --> 00:37:26.026
No, it's good.
I gotta get him back.

00:37:26.186 --> 00:37:27.186
You're going home
or I'll call Aunt May!

00:37:27.346 --> 00:37:28.546
You're done!

00:37:28.706 --> 00:37:29.746
Wait.

00:37:29.906 --> 00:37:32.906
Mr. Stark, wait.
I'm not done. I'm not...

00:37:35.066 --> 00:37:37.386
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.

00:37:53.546 --> 00:37:55.746
I said I'd help
you find him, not catch him.

00:37:56.306 --> 00:37:57.906
There's a difference.

00:38:04.626 --> 00:38:05.586
I'm sorry.

00:38:06.306 --> 00:38:07.386
Me, too.

00:38:08.306 --> 00:38:09.306
It's as I said.

00:38:09.826 --> 00:38:11.506
Catastrophe.

00:38:24.426 --> 00:38:26.266
Vision, I got a bandit
on my six.

00:38:31.026 --> 00:38:31.986
<i>Vision! You copy?</i>

00:38:32.186 --> 00:38:34.186
<i>Target his thruster,</i>
<i>turn him into a glider.</i>

00:38:49.346 --> 00:38:50.466
<i>Rhodey!</i>

00:38:52.266 --> 00:38:54.066
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:03.266
Rhodes!

00:39:16.026 --> 00:39:17.466
Read vitals.

00:39:17.626 --> 00:39:18.866
<i>Heartbeat detected.</i>

00:39:19.066 --> 00:39:21.066
<i>Emergency medical</i>
<i>is on its way.</i>

00:39:26.226 --> 00:39:27.226
I'm sorry.

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.630
She's dead.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:57.910
You were right.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:01.150
She wasn't who I thought she was.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.030
She was complicated.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.110
Complicated?

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.710
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.110
Dangerous.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:19.150
What if it overtook her?

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:23.390
She taught us it was forbidden...

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:28.150
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.110
She did what she thought was right.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:31.910
The bill comes due.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.230
Don't you see?

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:39.190
Her transgressions
led the Zealots to Dormammu.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:42.750
Kaecilius was her fault!

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:44.670
And here we are...

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.990
in the consequence of her deception.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:51.710
A world on fire.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:54.270
Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen.

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:56.230
The New York one
has been attacked twice.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:57.910
You know where they're going next.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:40:59.430
Hong Kong.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.830
You told me once to fight
like my life depended on it...

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:02.910
because one day, it might.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.670
Well, today is that day.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.870
I cannot defeat them alone.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:26.670
The Sanctum's already fallen.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.470
The Dark Dimension.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:39.710
Dormammu is coming.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.350
It's too late.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.150
Nothing can stop him.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:48.790
Not necessarily.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.150
No.

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:36.870
The spell's working.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.630
We've got a second chance.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.390
Whoa!

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:21.230
No!

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.830
Wong.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:42.910
Breaking the laws of nature. I know.

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.590
Well, don't stop now.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:49.630
When the Sanctum's restored,

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:50.870
they'll attack it again.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:52.110
We've got to defend it.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:53.630
Come on!

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:22.910
Get up, Strange.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:24.430
Get up and fight.

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.270
We can finish this.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:29.590
You can't fight the inevitable.

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:34.710
Isn't it beautiful?

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:38.670
A world beyond time.

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:42.590
Beyond death.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.270
-Beyond time...
-Strange.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:23.470
He's gone.

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:28.110
Even Strange has left you
and surrendered to his power.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:03.310
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.830
You've come to die.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:10.270
Your world is now my world...

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.990
like all worlds.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:46.310
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.310
You've come to die.

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.390
Your world is now my...

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:55.030
What is this?

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:57.070
Illusion?

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:58.510
No. This is real.

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:00.150
Good.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:13.470
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.950
You've... What is happening?

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:20.350
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension...

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.910
I brought a little power from mine.

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:25.430
This is time.

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:29.070
Endless looped time.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:31.510
You dare!

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.990
Oh...

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.550
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:40.910
You cannot do this forever.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.590
Actually, I can.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.230
This is how things are now.

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:48.430
You and me, trapped in this moment...

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.630
endlessly.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:53.390
Then you will spend eternity dying.

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:57.750
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:59.510
But you will suffer.

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:01.630
Pain's an old friend.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:05.590
Dormammu...

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:06.910
I've come to bargain.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:08.150
End this!

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.990
Dormammu... Dormammu...
Dormammu...

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:30.230
You will never win.

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:32.630
No...

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:34.790
but I can lose...

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:38.270
again and again...

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:40.030
and again...

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:42.790
and again, forever.

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:45.790
And that makes you my prisoner.

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.230
No!

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:48.310
Stop!

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:51.550
Make this stop!

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:53.830
Set me free!

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:55.830
No.

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.310
I've come to bargain.

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:02.350
What do you want?

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:06.190
Take your Zealots from the Earth.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.830
End your assault on my world.

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:10.910
Never come back.

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:12.510
Do it...

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:15.230
and I'll break the loop.

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:25.830
Get up, Strange!

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:27.310
Get up and fight.

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:29.510
We can finish this.

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.070
Isn't it beautiful?

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:35.830
A world beyond time.

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:40.030
Beyond death.

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:53.190
What have you done?

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:54.950
I made a bargain.

00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:58.910
What is this?

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.830
Well, it's everything you've ever wanted.

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:06.070
Eternal life as part of the One.

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:10.470
You're not gonna like it.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:31.710
Yeah, you know, you really should have

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:34.710
stolen the whole book
because the warnings...

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:37.030
The warnings come after the spells.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:48.070
Oh, that's funny.

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:16.950
We did it.

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:20.950
Yes.

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:23.470
Yes, we did it.

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:25.910
By also violating...

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:27.630
the natural law.

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:31.150
Look around you. It's over.

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:34.110
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:37.270
No price to pay?

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:40.790
We broke our rules, just like her.

00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:45.310
The bill comes due.

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:47.110
Always!

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:49.510
A reckoning.

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:55.430
I will follow this path no longer.

00:53:15.084 --> 00:53:16.764
What's gonna happen
to your friends?

00:53:25.284 --> 00:53:26.724
Whatever it is...

00:53:27.564 --> 00:53:29.204
I'll deal with it.

00:53:32.204 --> 00:53:34.124
I don't know if
I'm worth all this, Steve.

00:53:41.564 --> 00:53:43.244
What you did
all those years...

00:53:44.204 --> 00:53:45.724
It wasn't you.

00:53:46.564 --> 00:53:48.284
You didn't have a choice.

00:53:49.484 --> 00:53:51.124
I know.

00:53:53.724 --> 00:53:56.044
But I did it.

00:54:10.164 --> 00:54:12.284
How did this happen?

00:54:12.484 --> 00:54:14.484
I became distracted.

00:54:16.804 --> 00:54:18.924
I didn't think
that was possible.

00:54:20.324 --> 00:54:22.004
Neither did I.

00:54:38.524 --> 00:54:41.524
The doctors say
he shattered L4 through S1.

00:54:41.684 --> 00:54:44.484
Extreme laceration
to the spinal cord.

00:54:44.644 --> 00:54:47.284
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.

00:54:50.604 --> 00:54:52.164
Steve's not gonna stop.

00:54:52.964 --> 00:54:53.964
If you don't either,

00:54:54.044 --> 00:54:55.244
Rhodey's gonna be
the best case scenario.

00:54:55.484 --> 00:54:56.684
You let them go, Nat.

00:54:56.844 --> 00:54:57.884
We played this wrong.

00:54:58.044 --> 00:54:59.284
"We"?

00:54:59.724 --> 00:55:00.804
Boy, it must be hard to

00:55:00.884 --> 00:55:01.964
shake the whole
double agent thing, huh?

00:55:02.444 --> 00:55:04.164
It sticks
in the DNA.

00:55:05.564 --> 00:55:08.284
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...

00:55:08.484 --> 00:55:10.524
for one goddamn second?

00:55:14.724 --> 00:55:16.964
T'Challa told Ross
what you did, so...

00:55:18.324 --> 00:55:19.884
they're coming for you.

00:55:20.964 --> 00:55:23.364
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.

00:55:50.591 --> 00:55:52.071
Yeah, okay.

00:56:01.431 --> 00:56:02.711
Wise choice.

00:56:03.471 --> 00:56:05.511
You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto...

00:56:05.591 --> 00:56:07.871
once you've mastered its powers.

00:56:07.951 --> 00:56:09.111
Until then...

00:56:10.271 --> 00:56:12.871
best not to walk the streets
wearing an Infinity Stone.

00:56:12.951 --> 00:56:14.031
A what?

00:56:15.431 --> 00:56:17.471
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

00:56:17.591 --> 00:56:19.431
but you still have much to learn.

00:56:20.791 --> 00:56:24.551
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the Multiverse.

00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:27.111
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme
to defend it.

00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:28.671
We must be ready.

00:56:28.831 --> 00:56:29.831
We'll be ready.
