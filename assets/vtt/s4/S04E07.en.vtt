00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:41.466
 There's a girl
in this harbor town</i>

00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:44.586
<i>♪ And she works
layin' whiskey down</i>

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:49.026
<i>♪ They say, "Brandy,
fetch another round"</i>

00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:52.226
<i>♪ And she serves
them whiskey and wine</i>

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:56.346
<i>♪ The sailors say "Brandy,
you're a fine girl"</i>

00:00:56.546 --> 00:01:00.386
<i>♪ "What a good wife
you would be"</i>

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:13.306
- Come on!
- Slow down!

00:01:13.386 --> 00:01:15.386
This way, my river lily!
Come on!

00:01:18.186 --> 00:01:19.506
Where are you taking me?

00:01:19.586 --> 00:01:20.586
Come on, come on.

00:01:20.986 --> 00:01:22.866
Look. Look!

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.986
Oh, it's beautiful!

00:01:25.146 --> 00:01:27.226
I was afraid it wouldn't
take to the soil...

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:28.626
but it rooted quickly.

00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:31.466
And soon, it'll be everywhere.

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.666
All across the universe.

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.066
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:39.786
but I like the way you say it.

00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:41.706
My heart is yours...

00:01:42.746 --> 00:01:44.466
Meredith Quill.

00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:48.866
I can't believe I fell in
love with a spaceman.

00:02:50.563 --> 00:02:52.803
So I guess this could
all be mine someday.

00:02:54.043 --> 00:02:56.683
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:05.523
What are you doing, Peter?

00:03:07.843 --> 00:03:09.203
Dance with me.

00:03:09.363 --> 00:03:10.843
I'm not going to dance with you.

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:12.763
This is Sam Cooke...

00:03:13.243 --> 00:03:16.403
one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:47.603
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

00:03:48.763 --> 00:03:51.283
If you ever tell
anyone about this...

00:03:51.443 --> 00:03:52.883
I will kill you.

00:03:53.643 --> 00:03:57.443
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

00:03:58.123 --> 00:03:59.563
What unspoken thing?

00:04:00.963 --> 00:04:02.643
This...

00:04:02.803 --> 00:04:05.643
<i>Cheers,</i> Sam and Diane...

00:04:05.803 --> 00:04:08.483
a guy and a girl on a TV
show who dig each other...

00:04:08.563 --> 00:04:09.923
but never say it
because if they do,

00:04:09.963 --> 00:04:11.163
the ratings would go down...

00:04:11.243 --> 00:04:12.403
sort of thing.

00:04:12.483 --> 00:04:13.923
There's no unspoken thing.

00:04:15.803 --> 00:04:17.883
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,

00:04:17.963 --> 00:04:19.243
then it would be spoken...

00:04:19.323 --> 00:04:22.083
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

00:04:22.243 --> 00:04:26.323
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

00:04:26.483 --> 00:04:28.443
No, that's not what I...

00:04:30.763 --> 00:04:34.843
What we should be discussing right
now is something about this place.

00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:36.803
It doesn't feel right.

00:04:37.203 --> 00:04:39.363
What are you talking about?

00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:40.923
You're the one who
wanted me to come here!

00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:42.203
That girl Mantis...

00:04:42.363 --> 00:04:43.603
she's afraid of something.

00:04:43.923 --> 00:04:46.083
Why are you trying to
take this away from me?

00:04:46.243 --> 00:04:47.443
I'm not trying...

00:04:47.523 --> 00:04:49.403
He's my father. He's blood.

00:04:49.563 --> 00:04:51.523
You have blood on Earth and
you never wanted to return there.

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:53.603
Again, you made me come here!

00:04:53.683 --> 00:04:55.683
And Earth is the place where
my mother died in front of me.

00:04:55.723 --> 00:04:58.483
No, it's because that place
is real, and this is a fantasy.

00:04:58.643 --> 00:05:01.403
This is real! I'm only
half human, remember?

00:05:01.483 --> 00:05:02.883
That's the half
I'm worried about.

00:05:03.483 --> 00:05:05.163
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...

00:05:05.323 --> 00:05:07.723
because I'm part-god, and
you like when I'm the weak one.

00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:10.403
You were insufferable
to begin with.

00:05:10.563 --> 00:05:11.603
I haven't been able
to reach Rocket.

00:05:11.683 --> 00:05:13.243
I'm gonna go outside, and
I'm gonna try and get a signal.

00:05:13.403 --> 00:05:16.243
You know what?
This is not <i>Cheers</i> after all!

00:05:16.403 --> 00:05:19.243
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...

00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:21.163
to open themselves
up to new possibility,

00:05:21.203 --> 00:05:22.963
and the other
person is a jerk...

00:05:23.043 --> 00:05:24.883
who doesn't trust anybody!

00:05:24.963 --> 00:05:26.723
It's a show that doesn't exist.

00:05:26.883 --> 00:05:28.363
That's why it would
get zero ratings!

00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:30.803
I don't know what <i>Cheers</i> is!

00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:34.163
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

00:05:35.363 --> 00:05:36.923
I thought you already had.

00:05:44.784 --> 00:05:47.120
So, are we there yet?

00:05:47.287 --> 00:05:49.330
You'll know when we're there.

00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:53.042
Slight right.

00:05:54.377 --> 00:05:55.587
Straight on.

00:05:56.421 --> 00:05:57.422
Right.

00:06:00.008 --> 00:06:01.050
Slight right.

00:06:01.968 --> 00:06:04.387
Oh, very good, my darling.

00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:07.724
Yes, very good.

00:06:07.891 --> 00:06:10.977
Yes, very good, my darling.

00:06:23.323 --> 00:06:26.618
Back home where it's safe.
Come on. Go on.

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:18.460
Honey, we're home.

00:07:29.638 --> 00:07:31.391
Come on, girls.

00:07:41.484 --> 00:07:44.195
Welcome to my humble abode.

00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:46.614
Make yourself at home.

00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:50.826
Let's have a drink.

00:08:05.842 --> 00:08:07.343
Hey, no funny business.

00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:10.764
I am putting away my weapon.

00:08:34.496 --> 00:08:35.830
Are there any booby
traps around here?

00:08:35.914 --> 00:08:36.998
Anything we need to know about?

00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:38.792
I didn't raise my
girls to fall in traps.

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.710
You didn't raise us at all.

00:08:42.796 --> 00:08:44.339
Oh, maybe so.

00:08:44.714 --> 00:08:48.009
But if you got soft, it
wasn't on my watch.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.242
Let's drink.

00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:15.328
Okay.

00:09:26.548 --> 00:09:27.882
Still fits.

00:09:29.426 --> 00:09:31.094
Oh, my God.

00:09:34.264 --> 00:09:35.515
I never washed it once.

00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:37.267
Come and drink.

00:09:40.687 --> 00:09:43.231
Rise, you workers of salvation

00:09:46.317 --> 00:09:48.111
Family

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.739
back together again.

00:09:51.322 --> 00:09:53.533
- Mmm.
- Seeing as our

00:09:53.616 --> 00:09:54.784
family construct

00:09:54.951 --> 00:09:57.746
was just a calculated ruse
that only lasted three years,

00:09:57.954 --> 00:10:02.250
I don't think that we can use
this term anymore, can we?

00:10:02.417 --> 00:10:04.878
Agreed. So, here's
what's gonna happen...

00:10:05.044 --> 00:10:08.173
Okay. A reunion then, huh?

00:10:08.339 --> 00:10:09.424
And, uh...

00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:12.010
I want to say something
right off the bat.

00:10:12.385 --> 00:10:14.304
You haven't aged a day, huh?

00:10:14.471 --> 00:10:19.601
You're just as beautiful and as supple
as the day they staged our marriage.

00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:22.562
You got fat.

00:10:23.229 --> 00:10:25.857
But still good.

00:10:26.441 --> 00:10:28.777
I just got out of prison.
I, uh...

00:10:30.737 --> 00:10:32.238
- I have a lot of energy.
- Oh!

00:10:32.614 --> 00:10:34.240
Please don't do that.

00:10:36.242 --> 00:10:38.328
So, here's what's gonna happen.

00:10:38.495 --> 00:10:39.913
Natasha, don't slouch.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.791
- I'm not slouching.
- Yes, yes, you are.

00:10:42.874 --> 00:10:43.875
I don't slouch.

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.085
You're going to
get a back hunch.

00:10:45.251 --> 00:10:46.503
- Listen to your mother.
- Oh, my God, this...

00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:47.587
Up, up.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.089
All right, enough. All of you.

00:10:49.255 --> 00:10:51.007
I didn't say anything.
That's not fair.

00:10:51.174 --> 00:10:52.675
- Here's what's gonna happen...
- I don't want any food.

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:54.844
Eat a little something,
Yelena, for God's sake.

00:10:54.928 --> 00:10:56.679
You're gonna tell us the
location of the Red Room.

00:11:00.558 --> 00:11:03.395
You know, it's like
when you told them

00:11:03.478 --> 00:11:05.605
that they could stay up
late to catch Santa Claus.

00:11:05.772 --> 00:11:07.857
What? That was fun. You know,
"He come down the chimney, girls."

00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:09.275
"Look out. Where is he?"

00:11:09.359 --> 00:11:12.237
You wait for him, and then
when the cookies are gone,

00:11:12.404 --> 00:11:14.280
then you see he's there.

00:11:14.447 --> 00:11:16.324
No, no. What? I want them

00:11:16.408 --> 00:11:18.034
- to follow their dreams.
- No good.

00:11:18.201 --> 00:11:20.245
Reach for the stars, girls.

00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:22.914
Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy.
It's unfinished business.

00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:26.960
You can't defeat a man who
commands the very will of others.

00:11:27.127 --> 00:11:31.005
You never saw the culmination
of what we started in America.

00:11:31.172 --> 00:11:32.507
Nor did you.

00:11:35.135 --> 00:11:39.389
Natasha, always focus, focus.
Get what you want.

00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:47.522
Come in.

00:11:54.863 --> 00:11:56.406
Did that pig just open the door?

00:11:56.573 --> 00:11:58.658
Yes. It did.

00:11:58.825 --> 00:12:01.578
Good boy, Alexei. Good boy.

00:12:02.579 --> 00:12:04.372
You named a pig after me?

00:12:04.998 --> 00:12:06.750
You don't see the resemblance?

00:12:10.712 --> 00:12:12.172
See, he sits just like dog.

00:12:13.173 --> 00:12:14.591
Amazing. Now, watch.

00:12:14.758 --> 00:12:16.050
It's a little weird, to me.

00:12:16.217 --> 00:12:17.719
Stop breathing.

00:12:23.099 --> 00:12:26.436
We infiltrated the
North Institute in Ohio.

00:12:26.603 --> 00:12:28.146
It was a front for
S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists.

00:12:28.229 --> 00:12:31.483
Actually, it was Hydra
scientists at that time.

00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:33.193
In conjunction with the
Winter Soldier project,

00:12:33.359 --> 00:12:36.237
they had dissected and
deconstructed the human brain

00:12:36.404 --> 00:12:41.076
to create the first and only cellular
blueprint of the basal ganglia.

00:12:41.242 --> 00:12:42.660
Was the hub for cognition.

00:12:42.827 --> 00:12:46.122
Voluntary motor movement,
procedural learning.

00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:51.419
We didn't steal weaponry
or technology.

00:12:51.586 --> 00:12:54.422
We stole the key to
unlocking free will.

00:13:00.261 --> 00:13:01.262
What are you doing?

00:13:01.387 --> 00:13:05.058
Oh, I am explaining that
the science is now so exact,

00:13:05.225 --> 00:13:07.435
the subject can be
instructed to stop breathing

00:13:07.602 --> 00:13:09.479
and has no choice but to obey.

00:13:09.646 --> 00:13:11.147
Okay, you made your
point. That's enough.

00:13:11.314 --> 00:13:14.192
Yes, all right. Well, don't worry,
Alexei could've survived

00:13:14.359 --> 00:13:16.945
11 more seconds without oxygen.

00:13:17.112 --> 00:13:19.906
Good boy. Now, you go back,
back home where it's safe.

00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:23.535
You go. You go back home,
back home where it's safe.

00:13:24.285 --> 00:13:25.954
Good boy, Alexei.

00:13:26.121 --> 00:13:29.749
The world functions on a
higher level when it is controlled.

00:13:29.916 --> 00:13:34.295
Dreykov has chemically subjugated
agents planted around the globe.

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:36.589
And do you know
who they test it on?

00:13:36.673 --> 00:13:38.007
Hmm...

00:13:38.091 --> 00:13:39.843
No. That's not my department.

00:13:39.926 --> 00:13:41.803
Ah, come on, come on.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.847
- Don't lie to them. Hmm?
- I'm not lying.

00:13:44.013 --> 00:13:45.473
You're Dreykov's architect, huh?

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.641
What were you?

00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:48.393
If I was his architect,
you were his partner.

00:13:48.476 --> 00:13:49.519
You were his business partner.

00:13:49.602 --> 00:13:50.895
No, no, no. I was patsy!

00:13:50.979 --> 00:13:53.273
- Don't give me that...
- He sell me ideology.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.607
- Stop with the politics.
- All the while, bigger...

00:13:54.774 --> 00:13:57.569
Shut up! You are an idiot.

00:14:02.157 --> 00:14:03.658
And you're a coward.

00:14:06.077 --> 00:14:07.620
You're a coward.

00:14:07.787 --> 00:14:11.916
And our family was never real,
so there's nothing to hold on to.

00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:14.711
We're moving on.

00:14:14.878 --> 00:14:17.213
Never family, huh?

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.049
In my heart, I am simple man.

00:14:20.967 --> 00:14:24.220
And I think that for a couple
deep undercover Russian agents

00:14:24.387 --> 00:14:26.431
I think we did pretty
great as parents, huh?

00:14:26.723 --> 00:14:30.060
Yes, we had our orders, and
we played our roles to perfection.

00:14:30.602 --> 00:14:32.896
Who cares? That wasn't real.

00:14:33.188 --> 00:14:35.607
- What?
- That wasn't real. Who cares?

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:37.525
Don't say that.

00:14:38.068 --> 00:14:40.612
Please don't say that.
It was real.

00:14:41.362 --> 00:14:44.324
It was real to me.
You are my mother.

00:14:45.533 --> 00:14:47.243
You were my real mother.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.038
The closest thing
I ever had to one.

00:14:51.164 --> 00:14:54.000
The best part of
my life was fake.

00:14:55.502 --> 00:14:57.837
And none of you told me.

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:02.926
And those agents

00:15:03.009 --> 00:15:05.720
you chemically subjugated
around the globe?

00:15:07.305 --> 00:15:09.349
That was me.

00:15:11.643 --> 00:15:12.644
Mmm.

00:15:15.605 --> 00:15:17.524
And you, you got out.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.068
Dreykov made sure
no one could escape.

00:15:20.902 --> 00:15:22.946
Are you gonna say anything?

00:15:26.491 --> 00:15:27.492
No.

00:15:28.952 --> 00:15:29.953
Don't touch me.

00:15:33.289 --> 00:15:34.290
Yelena.

00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:35.875
No.

00:15:39.712 --> 00:15:42.215
- I had no idea.
- It's okay, it's okay.

00:15:42.382 --> 00:15:44.259
I'll go talk to her.

00:16:16.432 --> 00:16:17.712
Damn it.

00:16:50.872 --> 00:16:51.952
Psychopath!

00:19:02.272 --> 00:19:04.112
Are you kidding me?

00:19:30.392 --> 00:19:31.392
I win.

00:19:32.032 --> 00:19:34.232
I win. I bested you in combat.

00:19:34.392 --> 00:19:36.272
No. I saved your life.

00:19:36.432 --> 00:19:38.392
Well, you were stupid
enough to let me live.

00:19:38.432 --> 00:19:39.472
You let me live!

00:19:39.632 --> 00:19:41.392
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

00:19:41.552 --> 00:19:42.912
I'm not the one that just
flew across the universe

00:19:42.952 --> 00:19:44.272
just because I wanted to win.

00:19:44.352 --> 00:19:45.992
Do not tell me what I want.

00:19:46.072 --> 00:19:47.552
I don't need to tell
you what you want!

00:19:47.632 --> 00:19:48.752
It's obvious!

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:51.912
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:01.192
You were all I had.

00:20:02.552 --> 00:20:05.392
But you were the one
who needed to win.

00:20:06.552 --> 00:20:08.752
Thanos pulled my
eye from my head...

00:20:09.512 --> 00:20:11.512
and my brain from my skull...

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.592
and my arm from my body...

00:20:16.392 --> 00:20:18.472
because of you.

00:20:30.016 --> 00:20:32.560
- Mom.
- Oh, kids. All right.

00:20:32.727 --> 00:20:35.229
Peter.
Come here, come here, come here.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.652
<i>This past weekend, Midtown's
Academic Decathlon team...</i>

00:20:41.819 --> 00:20:44.781
<i>...defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.</i>

00:20:44.947 --> 00:20:46.616
<i>Later that day, they
also defeated death.</i>

00:20:46.783 --> 00:20:49.202
<i>Explosion. Sally scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.</i>

00:20:49.368 --> 00:20:50.949
<i>There were purple
lasers and smoke.</i>

00:20:50.973 --> 00:20:53.164
<i>It was [bleep] tight,
like a Bon Jovi concert.</i>

00:20:53.331 --> 00:20:56.709
<i>As you know, we made it out
alive, and that's the important thing.</i>

00:20:56.876 --> 00:20:59.962
<i>I couldn't bear to lose a
student on a school trip.</i>

00:21:01.214 --> 00:21:02.256
<i>Not again.</i>

00:21:02.423 --> 00:21:06.552
<i>Thankfully, no one was seriously
injured thanks to the Spider-Man.</i>

00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:08.554
<i>- Thank you, Spider-Man.</i>
<i>- Thank you, Spider-Man.</i>

00:21:08.721 --> 00:21:11.641
<i>Up next: the Spider-Man
mania is sweeping the school.</i>

00:21:11.808 --> 00:21:14.435
<i>How can you show
your spider spirit?</i>

00:21:18.356 --> 00:21:20.274
Dude, dude, dude.

00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:23.152
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?

00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:24.779
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.

00:21:24.946 --> 00:21:26.781
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.

00:21:26.948 --> 00:21:29.742
- Should I tell everyone?
- No, dude. That's not a good idea.

00:21:30.159 --> 00:21:33.246
- Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
- I'm not going to class.

00:21:33.412 --> 00:21:35.164
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.

00:21:35.331 --> 00:21:36.874
Dude, listen, I figured it out.

00:21:37.041 --> 00:21:38.960
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.

00:21:39.127 --> 00:21:42.130
What he takes from Damage Control,
that's how he builds the weapons.

00:21:42.296 --> 00:21:45.216
- So all I gotta do is catch him.
- But we have a Spanish quiz.

00:21:45.383 --> 00:21:47.593
Ned, I'm probably never
gonna come back here.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.805
Mr.
Stark is moving the Avengers upstate...

00:21:50.972 --> 00:21:52.932
- ...so when I bring this guy in--
- Dude.

00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:55.017
You want to be a
high school dropout?

00:21:55.184 --> 00:21:57.854
I am so far beyond
high school right now.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.731
Parker, my office.

00:22:03.401 --> 00:22:05.027
<i>So...</i>

00:22:05.194 --> 00:22:06.696
<i>...you got detention.</i>

00:22:06.863 --> 00:22:09.031
<i>You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.</i>

00:22:09.198 --> 00:22:11.576
<i>The question is, how are
you gonna make things right?</i>

00:22:11.742 --> 00:22:12.910
<i>Maybe you were
trying to be cool.</i>

00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:16.289
<i>But take it from a guy who's
been frozen for 65 years...</i>

00:22:16.456 --> 00:22:19.584
<i>...the only way to really
be cool is to follow the rules.</i>

00:22:20.585 --> 00:22:23.212
<i>We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.</i>

00:22:23.379 --> 00:22:25.923
<i>Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something...</i>

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.342
- <i>...you know is wrong...</i>
- Where you going? Get back here.

00:22:28.509 --> 00:22:30.887
<i>...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?</i>

00:22:31.053 --> 00:22:32.847
Why are you here?
You don't have detention.

00:22:33.014 --> 00:22:36.601
Oh, I know. I just like coming
here to sketch people in crisis.

00:22:39.812 --> 00:22:41.355
It's you.

00:22:41.856 --> 00:22:45.610
<i>So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.</i>

00:22:57.205 --> 00:22:58.873
May?

00:23:02.376 --> 00:23:03.419
Hey, Karen. What's up?

00:23:03.586 --> 00:23:05.379
<i>Hey, Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?</i>

00:23:05.546 --> 00:23:06.631
I was wondering if
you could help me.

00:23:06.798 --> 00:23:09.300
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night...

00:23:09.467 --> 00:23:11.928
...but I can only remember
part of a license plate.

00:23:12.095 --> 00:23:14.889
<i>I can run facial recognition on
the footage of that encounter.</i>

00:23:15.056 --> 00:23:16.557
- Footage?
<i>- Yes, Peter.</i>

00:23:16.724 --> 00:23:18.601
<i>I record everything you see.</i>

00:23:18.768 --> 00:23:19.894
- Everything?
<i>- Everything.</i>

00:23:20.061 --> 00:23:22.396
- All the time?
<i>- It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.</i>

00:23:23.189 --> 00:23:26.109
Yeah, of course it is. Um....

00:23:26.317 --> 00:23:29.153
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
<i>- With pleasure.</i>

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.197
<i>Hey, everyone.
Yeah, kick-ass party.</i>

00:23:31.364 --> 00:23:33.950
<i>Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.</i>

00:23:34.117 --> 00:23:36.077
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.

00:23:36.244 --> 00:23:37.954
Go later in the
day, later in the day.

00:23:38.121 --> 00:23:40.289
<i>It is I, Thor, son of Odin.</i>

00:23:40.456 --> 00:23:41.916
No, no, no. That's definitely--

00:23:42.083 --> 00:23:43.668
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.

00:23:43.835 --> 00:23:47.338
<i>- Your impressions are funny.</i>
- Fast-forward to the arms deal.

00:23:47.505 --> 00:23:48.798
Okay.

00:23:48.965 --> 00:23:50.591
The two on the
right, who are they?

00:23:50.758 --> 00:23:52.468
<i>Searching
law-enforcement databases.</i>

00:23:53.344 --> 00:23:55.346
<i>No records found for
two of the individuals.</i>

00:23:55.513 --> 00:23:57.598
- Nothing?
<i>- One individual identified.</i>

00:23:57.765 --> 00:23:59.892
<i>Aaron Davis, age 33.</i>

00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:02.895
<i>He has a criminal record and
an address here in Queens.</i>

00:24:03.062 --> 00:24:04.313
Let's pay him a visit.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.817
<i>Would you like me to activate the
Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?</i>

00:24:07.984 --> 00:24:09.068
Uh, yeah.

00:24:24.292 --> 00:24:26.043
<i>- Remember me?</i>
- Hey--

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.045
<i>I need information.
You'll give it to me now.</i>

00:24:28.212 --> 00:24:29.922
- All right, chill.
<i>- Come on!</i>

00:24:30.673 --> 00:24:33.301
- What happened to your voice?
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

00:24:33.468 --> 00:24:35.553
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.681
<i>I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a-- I'm a man.</i>

00:24:38.848 --> 00:24:40.683
I don't care what
you are, a boy, a girl--

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:42.518
<i>I'm not a girl. I'm a man.</i>

00:24:42.685 --> 00:24:45.021
<i>Come on, man. Look,
who is selling these weapons?</i>

00:24:45.396 --> 00:24:47.482
<i>I need to know.
Give me names or else.</i>

00:24:51.152 --> 00:24:55.448
- You ain't ever done this before, huh?
<i>- Deactivate Interrogation Mode.</i>

00:24:56.824 --> 00:24:57.867
Look, man.

00:24:58.534 --> 00:25:01.245
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.

00:25:01.412 --> 00:25:02.830
They can't be
out on the streets.

00:25:02.997 --> 00:25:05.166
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half--

00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:07.919
- You know Delmar's?
- Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.

00:25:08.086 --> 00:25:10.296
- Sub Haven's pretty good.
- Eh, it's too much bread.

00:25:10.463 --> 00:25:12.590
- I like bread.
- Come on, man, please.

00:25:14.926 --> 00:25:17.637
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.

00:25:17.804 --> 00:25:21.265
The other night, you told that dude,
"If you shoot somebody, shoot me."

00:25:21.432 --> 00:25:22.892
It's pretty ballsy.

00:25:23.059 --> 00:25:25.103
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.

00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:26.646
I got a nephew who live here.

00:25:27.855 --> 00:25:29.107
Who are these guys?

00:25:29.273 --> 00:25:31.192
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?

00:25:31.359 --> 00:25:33.611
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.

00:25:33.778 --> 00:25:35.738
I don't know who
he is or where he is.

00:25:38.658 --> 00:25:42.203
- I do know where he's gonna be.
- Really?

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.622
Yeah, this crazy dude
I used to work with...

00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:47.208
...he's supposed to be
doing a deal with him.

00:25:47.375 --> 00:25:49.001
Yes! Yes.

00:25:49.168 --> 00:25:50.753
- Thank--
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.214
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.

00:25:53.381 --> 00:25:55.883
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just--

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:57.301
Yeah.

00:25:57.468 --> 00:25:59.637
- Where is it?
- Can I give you some advice?

00:26:00.522 --> 00:26:02.849
You gotta get better
at this part of the job.

00:26:03.015 --> 00:26:04.475
I don't understand.

00:26:04.642 --> 00:26:06.018
I'm intimidating.

00:26:06.185 --> 00:26:09.063
- Staten Island Ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.940
That's gonna
dissolve in two hours.

00:26:11.107 --> 00:26:13.693
No, no, no. Come fix this.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.528
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.

00:26:15.695 --> 00:26:15.695
You deserve that. You're
a criminal. Bye, Mr. Criminal.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.213
Nice.

00:26:37.508 --> 00:26:40.136
Okay, Karen, activate
Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

00:26:40.303 --> 00:26:41.345
<i>Sure thing.</i>

00:26:41.721 --> 00:26:43.848
He's up front, main deck.

00:26:44.015 --> 00:26:45.433
I hate this guy.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.935
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?

00:26:48.102 --> 00:26:49.729
Just keep me posted.

00:26:49.896 --> 00:26:51.773
<i>There's no record of him
in my criminal database.</i>

00:26:51.939 --> 00:26:54.609
<i>Incoming call from May Parker.
Should I reroute to your heads-up display?</i>

00:26:54.776 --> 00:26:57.195
I can't talk right now.
I'll call her back.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:02.450
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.

00:27:10.708 --> 00:27:12.794
- Who's the guy on the left?
<i>- Mac Gargan.</i>

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.379
<i>Extensive criminal
record, including homicide.</i>

00:27:15.546 --> 00:27:17.381
<i>Would you like me
to activate Instant Kill?</i>

00:27:17.548 --> 00:27:20.968
No, Karen, stop it with
the Instant Kill already.

00:27:22.178 --> 00:27:24.472
White pickup truck.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:31.104
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.

00:27:51.999 --> 00:27:53.251
Oh, this is too perfect.

00:27:53.418 --> 00:27:55.753
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.881
<i>- Incoming call from Tony Stark.</i>
- No, no, no.

00:27:59.048 --> 00:28:01.217
- Don't answer.
<i>- Mr. Parker. Got a sec?</i>

00:28:01.384 --> 00:28:03.803
- Uh, I'm actually at school.
<i>- No, you're not.</i>

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.847
<i>- Nice work in D.C.</i>
- Okay.

00:28:06.013 --> 00:28:08.724
<i>My dad never really
gave me a lot of support...</i>

00:28:08.891 --> 00:28:11.060
<i>...and I'm trying to
break the cycle of shame.</i>

00:28:11.227 --> 00:28:12.395
Uh, I'm in the
middle of something.

00:28:12.562 --> 00:28:13.938
<i>Don't cut me off when
I'm complimenting you.</i>

00:28:14.105 --> 00:28:15.731
<i>Anyway, great
things are about to--</i>

00:28:17.442 --> 00:28:19.861
<i>- What is that?</i>
- Uh, I'm at band practice.

00:28:20.027 --> 00:28:24.699
<i>That's odd. Happy told me you
quit band six weeks ago. What's up?</i>

00:28:24.866 --> 00:28:27.076
- I gotta go. Uh, end call.
<i>- Hey.</i>

00:28:27.243 --> 00:28:28.369
I'll take those!

00:28:29.245 --> 00:28:30.413
Yoink.

00:28:31.998 --> 00:28:35.334
Hey, guys. The illegal-weapons-deal
ferry was at 10:30. You missed it.

00:28:44.343 --> 00:28:45.970
<i>Spider guy's here.</i>

00:28:48.639 --> 00:28:51.142
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast.

00:28:51.976 --> 00:28:55.271
Are you guys okay? My bad.
That was a little hard.

00:28:55.813 --> 00:28:58.983
I got to say, the other guy
was way better with that thing.

00:28:59.442 --> 00:29:00.651
I'm honestly--

00:29:00.818 --> 00:29:02.779
I'm-- I'm shocked.

00:29:14.832 --> 00:29:16.793
- Freeze! FBI.
- Don't move.

00:29:16.959 --> 00:29:18.753
- Get on the ground.
- FBI.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:19.962
What do you mean, FBI?

00:29:20.129 --> 00:29:23.549
<i>- Federal Bureau of Investigation.</i>
- I know, but what are they doing here?

00:29:31.516 --> 00:29:33.601
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:35.895
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No.

00:29:37.814 --> 00:29:40.608
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!

00:29:46.239 --> 00:29:47.615
- Move.
- Get to the top deck.

00:29:47.782 --> 00:29:49.325
We're getting out of here.

00:30:28.406 --> 00:30:30.491
Activate Taser web!

00:30:41.919 --> 00:30:44.964
You're messing with
things you don't understand.

00:31:24.337 --> 00:31:26.130
Oh, my God.
What do I do? Karen...

00:31:26.297 --> 00:31:29.550
...give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.

00:31:32.386 --> 00:31:34.430
Web grenade. Web grenade.

00:31:36.265 --> 00:31:38.476
Splitter web, go.

00:32:06.546 --> 00:32:09.674
<i>Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.</i>

00:32:09.841 --> 00:32:13.094
- Ninety-eight?
- Yeah, Spider-Man!

00:32:14.262 --> 00:32:16.848
No, no, no.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:36.409
No!

00:32:51.466 --> 00:32:53.092
What the hell?

00:32:56.512 --> 00:32:58.389
What the hell?

00:33:00.183 --> 00:33:01.893
<i>Hi, Spider-Man.</i>

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:04.437
<i>Band practice, was it?</i>

00:33:26.084 --> 00:33:28.294
Yeah, Iron Man!

00:33:35.885 --> 00:33:37.470
Uh, Mr. Stark.

00:33:39.013 --> 00:33:42.475
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?

00:33:43.267 --> 00:33:45.520
<i>I think you've done enough.</i>

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.235
<i>Previously on Peter
Screws the Pooch...</i>

00:34:08.402 --> 00:34:10.112
<i>...I tell you to stay
away from this.</i>

00:34:10.279 --> 00:34:12.907
<i>Instead, you hacked a
multimillion-dollar suit...</i>

00:34:13.074 --> 00:34:15.326
<i>...so you could sneak
around behind my back...</i>

00:34:15.493 --> 00:34:19.497
<i>- ...doing the one thing I told you not to do.</i>
- Is everyone okay?

00:34:20.373 --> 00:34:22.875
<i>No thanks to you.</i>

00:34:23.668 --> 00:34:25.670
No thanks to me?

00:34:27.213 --> 00:34:29.840
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it...

00:34:30.007 --> 00:34:31.384
...but you didn't listen.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.971
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.

00:34:35.137 --> 00:34:37.181
If you even cared,
you'd actually be here.

00:34:41.727 --> 00:34:44.814
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?

00:34:45.189 --> 00:34:47.566
Do you know I was the only
one who believed in you?

00:34:47.733 --> 00:34:51.529
Everyone else said I was
crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid.

00:34:51.696 --> 00:34:53.990
- I'm 15.
- No, this is where you zip it, all right?

00:34:54.156 --> 00:34:56.742
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:59.996
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.

00:35:00.162 --> 00:35:01.497
And if you died...

00:35:01.664 --> 00:35:03.874
...I feel like that's on me.

00:35:04.208 --> 00:35:06.085
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir.

00:35:06.252 --> 00:35:08.879
- I'm sorry. I understand.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

00:35:09.505 --> 00:35:11.424
I just wanted to be like you.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.134
And I wanted you to be better.

00:35:14.885 --> 00:35:17.263
It's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.640
- For how long?
- Forever.

00:35:19.807 --> 00:35:21.851
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no. Please.

00:35:22.018 --> 00:35:23.936
- Let's have it.
- Please, this is all I have.

00:35:24.103 --> 00:35:25.479
I'm nothing without this suit.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.649
If you're nothing without this
suit, then you shouldn't have it.

00:35:28.816 --> 00:35:29.984
Okay?

00:35:30.151 --> 00:35:32.361
God, I sound like my dad.

00:35:34.405 --> 00:35:36.282
I don't have any other clothes.

00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:38.951
Okay, we'll sort that out.

00:35:49.128 --> 00:35:50.504
Hey.

00:35:55.301 --> 00:35:58.638
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.

00:35:58.804 --> 00:36:00.264
You can't do that.

00:36:00.431 --> 00:36:03.059
Then this ferry thing happens.

00:36:03.225 --> 00:36:05.895
I've called five
police stations.

00:36:06.062 --> 00:36:07.271
Five.

00:36:07.438 --> 00:36:09.231
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.

00:36:09.398 --> 00:36:13.027
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

00:36:13.944 --> 00:36:14.987
Cut the bullshit.

00:36:15.154 --> 00:36:16.822
I know you left detention.

00:36:16.989 --> 00:36:19.492
I know you left the hotel
room in Washington.

00:36:19.659 --> 00:36:21.577
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.

00:36:21.744 --> 00:36:23.037
That's not fine.

00:36:23.204 --> 00:36:26.832
Peter, you have to tell me
what's going on. Just lay it out.

00:36:26.999 --> 00:36:28.042
It's just me and you.

00:36:29.919 --> 00:36:31.545
I lost the Stark internship.

00:36:32.129 --> 00:36:33.714
- What?
- Yeah.

00:36:34.173 --> 00:36:35.299
What happened?

00:36:35.841 --> 00:36:39.929
I just thought that I could work really
hard and he could-- He would-- You know.

00:36:41.263 --> 00:36:43.224
But I screwed it up.

00:36:43.391 --> 00:36:45.184
It's okay, it's okay.

00:36:46.894 --> 00:36:48.521
It's okay.

00:36:49.397 --> 00:36:51.816
I'm sorry I made you worry.

00:36:51.983 --> 00:36:53.818
I'm not trying
to ruin your life.

00:36:53.985 --> 00:36:55.277
Yeah, I know.

00:36:55.444 --> 00:36:56.737
Just--

00:36:56.904 --> 00:36:59.282
- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.

00:37:02.285 --> 00:37:04.453
And take a shower. You smell.

00:37:05.121 --> 00:37:07.498
You smell like garbage.

00:37:07.665 --> 00:37:09.292
I know.

00:37:25.246 --> 00:37:26.326
You all right, son?

00:37:29.606 --> 00:37:32.406
I saw your girl stomp off a
little earlier in quite a huff.

00:37:32.886 --> 00:37:34.246
Yeah.

00:37:34.406 --> 00:37:36.166
It's fortuitous...

00:37:36.326 --> 00:37:37.566
you listening to this song.

00:37:37.766 --> 00:37:39.366
You know... <i>Brandy?</i>

00:37:39.886 --> 00:37:40.926
By Looking Glass?

00:37:42.726 --> 00:37:44.086
A favorite of your mom's.

00:37:44.926 --> 00:37:46.446
Yeah, it was.

00:37:46.926 --> 00:37:48.606
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:50.806
Perhaps its very greatest.

00:37:50.966 --> 00:37:51.966
Yes!

00:37:52.126 --> 00:37:55.286
Peter, you and I, we're
the sailor in that song.

00:37:57.566 --> 00:37:59.446
<i>♪ He came on a summer's day</i>

00:37:59.766 --> 00:38:02.286
<i>♪ Bringing gifts from far away</i>

00:38:04.326 --> 00:38:06.766
Like the child I put
in your mother...

00:38:06.926 --> 00:38:08.966
or the freedom you
brought Gamora.

00:38:11.126 --> 00:38:14.126
<i>♪ Brandy, you're a fine girl</i>

00:38:14.286 --> 00:38:16.966
<i>♪ What a good wife you would be</i>

00:38:18.006 --> 00:38:20.606
<i>♪ My life, my love</i>

00:38:20.806 --> 00:38:24.126
<i>♪ My lady is the sea ♪</i>

00:38:24.286 --> 00:38:26.126
The sea calls the sailor back.

00:38:26.286 --> 00:38:28.846
He loves the girl, but
that's not his place.

00:38:29.646 --> 00:38:33.646
The sea calls upon him as
history calls upon great men.

00:38:34.806 --> 00:38:38.326
And sometimes we are
deprived the pleasures of mortals.

00:38:38.846 --> 00:38:40.966
Well, you may not
be mortal, but me...

00:38:41.126 --> 00:38:42.406
No, Peter...

00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:44.486
death will remain a
stranger to both of us...

00:38:44.846 --> 00:38:47.006
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

00:38:47.966 --> 00:38:49.126
I'm immortal?

00:38:49.686 --> 00:38:50.686
Mmm-hmm.

00:38:51.326 --> 00:38:52.326
Really?

00:38:52.486 --> 00:38:55.326
Yes! As long as
the light exists.

00:38:56.366 --> 00:38:59.646
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

00:38:59.846 --> 00:39:02.126
like how you made
this whole planet?

00:39:02.286 --> 00:39:04.646
It might take you a few
million years of practice...

00:39:04.846 --> 00:39:07.006
before you get really
good at it. But, yes!

00:39:07.166 --> 00:39:08.206
What!

00:39:08.486 --> 00:39:12.006
Get ready for an 800-foot
statue of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

00:39:12.166 --> 00:39:13.286
and Heather Locklear.

00:39:13.326 --> 00:39:14.526
You can do anything you want.

00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:16.086
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

00:39:16.166 --> 00:39:19.366
But you know, Peter, it is a
tremendous responsibility.

00:39:19.526 --> 00:39:22.006
Only we can remake the universe.

00:39:22.166 --> 00:39:24.726
Only we can take the
bridle of the cosmos...

00:39:24.806 --> 00:39:27.646
and lead it to where
it needs to go.

00:39:28.806 --> 00:39:29.846
How?

00:39:40.326 --> 00:39:41.846
Come with me.

00:39:53.699 --> 00:39:56.202
I came in here because
I didn't want to talk.

00:39:57.912 --> 00:39:59.038
Okay.

00:40:00.081 --> 00:40:02.208
We, uh... We just sit.

00:40:07.046 --> 00:40:08.548
We just sit.

00:40:18.099 --> 00:40:19.267
Where are you going?

00:40:19.433 --> 00:40:21.769
- To do this myself.
- Don't. You won't survive.

00:40:21.936 --> 00:40:24.272
I wish I could believe
that you cared.

00:40:25.106 --> 00:40:27.275
But you're not even the first
mother that abandoned me.

00:40:27.442 --> 00:40:29.569
No, you weren't abandoned.

00:40:29.735 --> 00:40:31.696
You were selected by a program

00:40:31.779 --> 00:40:33.781
that assessed the
genetic potential in infants.

00:40:43.916 --> 00:40:45.418
I was taken?

00:40:45.877 --> 00:40:49.338
I believe a bargain was
struck, your family paid off.

00:40:49.964 --> 00:40:52.383
But your mother, she never
stopped looking for you.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.470
She was like you in
that way. She was

00:40:55.636 --> 00:40:57.180
relentless.

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:59.557
What happened to her?

00:41:01.267 --> 00:41:03.019
Dreykov had her killed.

00:41:04.312 --> 00:41:07.148
Her existence threatened
to uncover the Red Room.

00:41:08.191 --> 00:41:10.610
Normally, the actions
of one curious civilian

00:41:10.693 --> 00:41:11.778
wouldn't warrant an execution,

00:41:11.944 --> 00:41:14.655
but, as I said,
she was relentless.

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:20.244
I thought about her
every day of my life.

00:41:24.832 --> 00:41:27.668
Whether or not I
admitted it to myself, I did.

00:41:30.129 --> 00:41:32.507
I've always found it best
not to look into the past.

00:41:43.643 --> 00:41:45.144
Then why did you save this?

00:42:03.079 --> 00:42:04.997
I remember this day.

00:42:05.164 --> 00:42:09.127
We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving,
Easter and summer vacation all in one day.

00:42:09.752 --> 00:42:11.754
- Different backdrops.
- Mmm.

00:42:13.214 --> 00:42:17.760
I knew all the presents under the tree
were just empty boxes, but I didn't care.

00:42:17.927 --> 00:42:19.595
I wanted to open
every single one...

00:42:23.015 --> 00:42:25.810
so just for a second
it would feel real.

00:42:26.394 --> 00:42:27.770
Let's stop this.

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:36.821
Why you doing this?

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:41.909
Why does a mouse born in a
cage run on that little wheel?

00:42:42.076 --> 00:42:44.704
Do you know I was cycled
through the Red Room

00:42:44.787 --> 00:42:47.373
four times before
you were even born?

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.958
Those walls are all I know.

00:42:49.709 --> 00:42:51.961
I was never given a choice.

00:42:52.378 --> 00:42:54.672
But you're not a mouse, Melina.

00:42:57.175 --> 00:43:00.303
You were just born in a
cage, but that's not your fault.

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:07.226
Tell me, how did
you keep your heart?

00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:15.359
Pain only makes us stronger.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.279
Didn't you tell us that?

00:43:20.281 --> 00:43:22.700
What you taught
me kept me alive.

00:43:26.412 --> 00:43:28.414
I'm sorry, I already
alerted the Red Room.

00:43:28.581 --> 00:43:30.541
They'll be here any minute.

00:43:33.669 --> 00:43:38.007
So, there I am ice
fishing with my father.

00:43:39.008 --> 00:43:41.219
It's very cold day
in this little ice shed.

00:43:41.302 --> 00:43:42.678
Cold even for Russia, you know?

00:43:42.845 --> 00:43:45.598
"Keep the vodka by the fire,"
my father would say to me.

00:43:45.765 --> 00:43:46.891
Please stop talking.

00:43:46.974 --> 00:43:48.017
- Please wait. Please wait.
- Please, no.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.101
Please, I don't want to talk.

00:43:49.185 --> 00:43:50.728
Please. Please.

00:43:51.354 --> 00:43:54.065
There is a reason why I'm telling
you this, okay? Trust me.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.734
I am reaching for fish.

00:43:58.236 --> 00:44:01.197
Oh! I lose balance. Ah!

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.281
Splash!

00:44:02.365 --> 00:44:04.283
My hands go in the river.

00:44:04.367 --> 00:44:08.454
In this weather,
frostbite sets in quick.

00:44:08.913 --> 00:44:12.625
My father, he go
toilet on my hands.

00:44:12.792 --> 00:44:13.918
Oh, my God.

00:44:14.085 --> 00:44:18.881
Urine is 35 degrees Celsius,
staves off the frostbite.

00:44:19.048 --> 00:44:20.550
How is this relevant?

00:44:21.342 --> 00:44:22.635
You know,

00:44:23.136 --> 00:44:24.428
fathers.

00:44:26.973 --> 00:44:29.559
No. No.

00:44:30.226 --> 00:44:33.729
You have done nothing but
tell me how bored you were.

00:44:34.105 --> 00:44:38.109
I was the chore, the job
you didn't want to do.

00:44:38.484 --> 00:44:39.777
To me?

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.030
To me, you were everything.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:49.078
Exactly. You don't care.
You don't care.

00:44:49.579 --> 00:44:51.998
The only thing you care
about are your stupid glory days

00:44:52.165 --> 00:44:55.418
as the Crimson Dynamo, and
no one wants to hear about it.

00:45:02.049 --> 00:45:03.926
It's the Red Guardian.

00:45:04.093 --> 00:45:05.178
Get out.

00:45:05.553 --> 00:45:07.138
Get out!

00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:19.150
I can't remember

00:45:22.236 --> 00:45:24.155
If I cried

00:45:26.365 --> 00:45:29.952
<i>♪ When I read about
his widowed bride</i>

00:45:30.953 --> 00:45:35.208

<i>♪ "This'll be the day"</i>

00:46:33.641 --> 00:46:34.642
Get down.

00:46:41.524 --> 00:46:43.484
They think...

00:47:43.252 --> 00:47:44.712
I'm sorry.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:02.814
Let's not keep him waiting.

00:48:13.153 --> 00:48:14.753
Drax, Drax. Drax!

00:48:15.153 --> 00:48:16.793
Drax! We need to talk.

00:48:18.873 --> 00:48:20.673
I'm sorry.

00:48:20.873 --> 00:48:23.153
But I like a woman with
some meat on her bones.

00:48:23.193 --> 00:48:24.313
What?

00:48:24.473 --> 00:48:27.713
I tried to let you down easily by
telling you I found you disgusting.

00:48:27.873 --> 00:48:29.313
No, that's not what I...

00:48:32.833 --> 00:48:34.273
What are you doing?

00:48:34.833 --> 00:48:37.353
I'm imagining being
with you physically.

00:48:37.353 --> 00:48:38.673
Drax...

00:48:39.193 --> 00:48:40.513
I don't like you like that.

00:48:40.553 --> 00:48:42.513
I don't even like the
type of thing you are.

00:48:42.993 --> 00:48:45.513
Hey! There's no need
to get personal.

00:48:45.673 --> 00:48:48.193
Listen! Ego's gotten
exactly what he wanted.

00:48:48.353 --> 00:48:50.193
I should have told you earlier.

00:48:50.353 --> 00:48:53.473
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

00:48:59.193 --> 00:49:00.193
What is that?

00:49:03.673 --> 00:49:07.193
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

00:49:07.353 --> 00:49:10.473
Everything around
us, including the girl...

00:49:10.673 --> 00:49:14.073
Everything is temporary.

00:49:14.233 --> 00:49:17.193
We are forever.

00:49:17.353 --> 00:49:18.793
Doesn't eternity get boring?

00:49:18.873 --> 00:49:21.233
Not if you have a
purpose, Peter...

00:49:21.433 --> 00:49:23.393
which is why you're here.

00:49:23.553 --> 00:49:25.793
I told you how all
those years ago...

00:49:25.873 --> 00:49:29.993
I had an unceasing
impulse to find life.

00:49:30.193 --> 00:49:34.233
But what I did not tell you was
how, when I finally did find it...

00:49:34.913 --> 00:49:36.233
it was all so...

00:49:38.713 --> 00:49:40.553
disappointing.

00:49:40.873 --> 00:49:44.393
<i>And that is when I came...</i>

00:49:44.553 --> 00:49:48.233
to a profound realization.

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:53.713
My innate desire to
seek out other life...

00:49:54.233 --> 00:49:58.393
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

00:50:00.713 --> 00:50:01.873
Peter...

00:50:02.793 --> 00:50:06.033
I have found meaning.

00:50:25.953 --> 00:50:27.273
I see it.

00:50:29.753 --> 00:50:31.553
Eternity!

00:50:31.913 --> 00:50:33.393
Oh, my God.

00:50:43.953 --> 00:50:46.073
We need to get off this planet.

00:50:59.753 --> 00:51:01.033
Oh, man.

00:51:01.193 --> 00:51:03.633
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

00:51:03.833 --> 00:51:06.633
At that time, I was a
Federal Express man.

00:51:17.633 --> 00:51:19.753
What the hell you doing, boy?

00:51:19.833 --> 00:51:21.873
I could tell by how
you talked about him...

00:51:22.033 --> 00:51:23.353
this Ego is bad news.

00:51:23.553 --> 00:51:25.153
We're here to save Quill.

00:51:25.353 --> 00:51:29.513
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?

00:51:29.633 --> 00:51:32.513
No. I don't care
about those things.

00:51:32.673 --> 00:51:35.033
I wanna save Quill so I can
prove I'm better than him!

00:51:35.113 --> 00:51:37.953
I can lord this
over him forever.

00:51:39.673 --> 00:51:41.513
What are you laughing at me for?

00:51:42.153 --> 00:51:46.873
You can fool yourself and
everyone else, but you can't fool me.

00:51:47.033 --> 00:51:48.313
I know who you are.

00:51:48.353 --> 00:51:50.713
You don't know anything
about me, loser.

00:51:50.873 --> 00:51:53.073
I know everything about you.

00:51:53.553 --> 00:51:56.073
I know you play like you're
the meanest and the hardest...

00:51:56.153 --> 00:51:57.593
but, actually, you're
the most scared of all.

00:51:57.713 --> 00:51:58.713
Shut up!

00:51:58.753 --> 00:52:01.033
I know you steal
batteries you don't need...

00:52:01.193 --> 00:52:03.873
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

00:52:03.993 --> 00:52:05.353
because just a
little bit of love...

00:52:05.433 --> 00:52:08.753
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

00:52:09.073 --> 00:52:10.393
I said shut up!

00:52:10.833 --> 00:52:12.233
I know them scientists
what made you,

00:52:12.233 --> 00:52:13.993
never gave a
rat's ass about you.

00:52:14.033 --> 00:52:15.473
I'm serious, dude!

00:52:15.553 --> 00:52:18.073
Just like my own damn
parents who sold me...

00:52:18.273 --> 00:52:20.353
their own little
baby, into slavery.

00:52:20.753 --> 00:52:23.153
I know who you are, boy.

00:52:23.233 --> 00:52:25.233
Because you're me.

00:52:31.753 --> 00:52:33.873
What kind of a pair are we?

00:52:35.113 --> 00:52:38.193
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.

00:52:38.353 --> 00:52:41.513
All right, okay! Good. Wait.

00:52:41.913 --> 00:52:43.353
Fight a what?

00:52:47.753 --> 00:52:48.793
Who are you people?

00:52:48.873 --> 00:52:49.873
What is this place?

00:52:49.953 --> 00:52:50.953
Gamora, let her go!

00:52:51.113 --> 00:52:53.313
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?

00:52:53.473 --> 00:52:55.753
You are scared.

00:52:59.233 --> 00:53:02.113
I call it the Expansion.

00:53:03.233 --> 00:53:06.473
It is my purpose...

00:53:06.633 --> 00:53:10.153
and now it is yours as well.

00:53:11.073 --> 00:53:12.593
It's beautiful.

00:53:13.753 --> 00:53:15.073
Over thousands of years...

00:53:15.233 --> 00:53:19.313
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...

00:53:19.473 --> 00:53:22.233
on thousands of worlds.

00:53:22.393 --> 00:53:26.153
I need to fulfill life's
one true purpose...

00:53:26.313 --> 00:53:28.313
To grow and spread...

00:53:28.393 --> 00:53:31.513
covering all that exists...

00:53:31.673 --> 00:53:35.833
until everything is...

00:53:37.113 --> 00:53:38.153
Me!

00:53:38.953 --> 00:53:41.193
What did she do to me?

00:53:41.353 --> 00:53:43.113
She already told me everything.

00:53:43.273 --> 00:53:45.673
I only had one problem.

00:53:46.433 --> 00:53:49.433
A single Celestial doesn't
have enough power

00:53:49.473 --> 00:53:51.473
for such an enterprise.

00:53:51.633 --> 00:53:53.753
But two Celestials...

00:53:53.953 --> 00:53:57.193
Well, now, that just might do.

00:53:59.993 --> 00:54:01.313
The bodies...

00:54:02.113 --> 00:54:04.473
are his children.

00:54:04.953 --> 00:54:06.193
<i>Out of all my labors...</i>

00:54:06.353 --> 00:54:08.513
the most beguiling was...

00:54:08.673 --> 00:54:12.113
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

00:54:12.313 --> 00:54:15.273
I hoped the result of such a
coupling would be enough...

00:54:15.353 --> 00:54:17.313
to power the Expansion.

00:54:18.313 --> 00:54:20.873
<i>I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.</i>

00:54:20.953 --> 00:54:24.513
<i>It broke the Ravager code, but I
compensated him generously...</i>

00:54:24.633 --> 00:54:28.313
<i>and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.</i>

00:54:28.353 --> 00:54:31.113
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

00:54:31.193 --> 00:54:34.473
But one after the other,
they failed me.

00:54:34.633 --> 00:54:38.473
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.

00:54:38.633 --> 00:54:39.873
Until you, Peter.

00:54:41.113 --> 00:54:43.713
Out of all my spawn...

00:54:43.873 --> 00:54:47.953
only you carried the
connection to the light.

00:54:48.113 --> 00:54:51.193
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

00:54:51.273 --> 00:54:53.873
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.

00:54:54.953 --> 00:54:56.353
Then we just go. No!

00:54:56.513 --> 00:54:57.553
He's our friend.

00:54:57.713 --> 00:54:58.713
All any of you do...

00:54:58.873 --> 00:55:01.033
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

00:55:01.233 --> 00:55:02.633
You're right.

00:55:03.193 --> 00:55:04.313
We're family.

00:55:06.153 --> 00:55:07.713
We leave no one behind.

00:55:11.153 --> 00:55:12.513
Except maybe you.

00:55:13.033 --> 00:55:14.513
Oh, my God.

00:55:15.193 --> 00:55:17.233
For the first time
in my existence...

00:55:17.393 --> 00:55:20.473
I am truly not alone!

00:55:25.913 --> 00:55:27.193
What is it, son?

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:31.713
My friends.

00:55:32.913 --> 00:55:36.993
You see, that's the
mortal in you, Peter.

00:55:37.433 --> 00:55:38.433
Yes.

00:55:38.593 --> 00:55:41.673
We are beyond such things.

00:55:41.833 --> 00:55:42.833
Yes.

00:55:45.179 --> 00:55:46.379
- Now...
- But my mother...

00:55:49.353 --> 00:55:51.673
You said you loved my mother.

00:55:51.833 --> 00:55:53.353
And that I did.

00:55:54.593 --> 00:55:56.953
My river lily who
knew all the words

00:55:57.113 --> 00:55:59.433
to every song that
came over the radio.

00:56:01.273 --> 00:56:03.953
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.

00:56:04.113 --> 00:56:06.633
And I knew if I
returned a fourth...

00:56:06.793 --> 00:56:08.353
I'd never leave.

00:56:09.433 --> 00:56:11.033
The Expansion...

00:56:12.473 --> 00:56:14.873
the reason for my very
existence, would be over.

00:56:14.953 --> 00:56:16.953
So, I did what I had to do.

00:56:19.793 --> 00:56:23.313
But it broke my heart to
put that tumor in her head.

00:56:27.633 --> 00:56:28.713
What?

00:56:28.793 --> 00:56:30.313
Now, all right...

00:56:30.473 --> 00:56:32.273
I know that sounds bad.

00:56:44.153 --> 00:56:47.673
Who in the hell do
you think you are?

00:56:47.833 --> 00:56:49.513
You killed my mother!

00:56:49.633 --> 00:56:50.673
I tried...

00:56:50.833 --> 00:56:52.593
so hard...

00:56:52.753 --> 00:56:54.193
to find the form...

00:56:54.273 --> 00:56:56.753
that best suited you...

00:56:56.833 --> 00:56:59.233
and this is the thanks I get?

00:57:00.953 --> 00:57:03.513
You really need to grow up.

00:57:07.593 --> 00:57:09.833
I wanted to do this together...

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:11.953
but I suppose
you'll have to learn

00:57:11.993 --> 00:57:15.513
by spending the next
thousand years as a battery!

00:57:17.113 --> 00:57:18.873
Finally! Rocket?

00:57:19.033 --> 00:57:21.753
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

00:57:21.953 --> 00:57:25.193
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...

00:57:25.273 --> 00:57:26.553
<i>to slice open the
Bank of A'askavaria.</i>

00:57:26.633 --> 00:57:27.673
Ego's unhinged.

00:57:27.793 --> 00:57:29.273
<i>I know.
Get ready.</i>

00:57:29.353 --> 00:57:30.793
Drop her, Kraglin.

00:57:49.393 --> 00:57:50.513
No.

00:58:01.553 --> 00:58:04.473
<i>♪ My life, my love</i>

00:58:04.633 --> 00:58:06.873
<i>♪ My lady is the sea ♪</i>

00:58:08.913 --> 00:58:10.073
Peter...

00:58:10.873 --> 00:58:13.193
this is the sea.

00:58:15.353 --> 00:58:16.353
Oh...

00:59:50.342 --> 00:59:52.136
I can't re--

00:59:52.302 --> 00:59:54.096
Motherf--

00:59:55.347 --> 00:59:57.433
That's what I get for helping.

01:00:02.062 --> 01:00:03.981
Excuse me.

01:00:05.774 --> 01:00:08.235
A-- A human being needs help.

01:00:12.489 --> 01:00:13.991
Hate this dude, man.

01:00:14.158 --> 01:00:16.702
Yeah, sorry, Miles.
I'm not gonna make it.

01:00:16.869 --> 01:00:18.996
Yeah, I'm just stuck.

01:00:21.592 --> 01:00:23.272
Wait, where are you going?

01:00:23.432 --> 01:00:25.832
You were supposed
to be my lift home.

01:00:26.032 --> 01:00:27.632
How will I get out of here?

01:00:27.832 --> 01:00:29.152
Hey! Aw, gee...

01:00:29.232 --> 01:00:31.952
I've got so many
more stories to tell.

01:00:32.112 --> 01:00:33.352
Aw, guys.

01:00:33.512 --> 01:00:35.912
Oh, gee...
