WEBVTT

00:00:15.444 --> 00:00:18.072
Things are never
gonna be the same now.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.283
I mean, look at this.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.493
- You got aliens.
- Mm.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.913
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.958
When I was a kid, I used to
draw cowboys and Indians.

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:33.087
Um, actually, it's Native
American, but whatever.

00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:35.857
Yeah. Tell you what, though.

00:00:36.483 --> 00:00:38.443
It ain't bad, is it?

00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:40.362
No. Yeah.

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:42.406
Kid's got a future.

00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:44.366
Yeah, well...

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.660
...we'll see, I guess.

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:12.976
No, hey! Uh-uh!

00:01:13.143 --> 00:01:14.728
You can't saw
through that stuff.

00:01:15.687 --> 00:01:17.731
These alien bastards are tough.

00:01:17.897 --> 00:01:19.858
You gotta use
the stuff they use.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.863
- See? All right.
- All right.

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:28.366
Oh, hey!

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:30.827
Glad you could join us.
Afternoon.

00:01:30.994 --> 00:01:33.246
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.

00:01:33.413 --> 00:01:36.124
Look, just go stack that
armor plating like I asked you.

00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:38.084
This is a huge deal for us.

00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:39.711
Attention, please!

00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:42.714
In accordance with
Executive Order 396B...

00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:46.426
...all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.

00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:48.678
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:50.138
Who the hell are you?

00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:51.765
Qualified personnel.

00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:56.269
Look, I have a city contract to
salvage all this, okay, with the city, so--

00:01:56.436 --> 00:02:01.024
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under our jurisdiction.

00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:04.486
Please turn over any and all exotic
materials that you've collected...

00:02:04.653 --> 00:02:05.987
...or you will be prosecuted.

00:02:06.363 --> 00:02:08.114
Ma'am, what am--?

00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:11.159
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.

00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:12.911
Look...

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.580
...I bought trucks for this job.

00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:17.123
I brought in a whole new crew.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.793
These guys have a family.
I have a family.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.087
I'm all in on this.
I could lose my house.

00:02:22.253 --> 00:02:25.590
I'm sorry, sir.
There's nothing I can do.

00:02:25.757 --> 00:02:27.884
Maybe next time, don't
overextend yourself.

00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:31.096
What'd you say?

00:02:33.348 --> 00:02:34.641
Yeah.

00:02:34.808 --> 00:02:37.435
He's right.
I overextended myself.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.064
- Don't do it.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:42.983
Put them down.

00:02:44.943 --> 00:02:48.071
If you have a grievance, you
may take it up with my superiors.

00:02:48.446 --> 00:02:51.032
Your superiors.
Who the hell are they?

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.826
<i>A joint venture between
Stark Industries...</i>

00:02:52.993 --> 00:02:53.994
<i>...and the federal government...</i>

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.579
<i>...the Department of Damage
Control, will oversee the collection...</i>

00:02:56.746 --> 00:02:59.791
<i>...and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.</i>

00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.752
Now the assholes who made
this mess are paid to clean it up.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.170
Yeah, it's all rigged.

00:03:04.337 --> 00:03:07.924
<i>Experts estimate there are
over 1500 tons of exotic material...</i>

00:03:08.091 --> 00:03:10.093
<i>...scattered throughout
the tri-state area.</i>

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.596
Hey, chief!
We have another load from yesterday.

00:03:14.264 --> 00:03:15.598
We're supposed
to turn this in, right?

00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:16.808
I ain't hauling it.

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:18.184
It's too bad.

00:03:18.351 --> 00:03:21.271
We could have made some
cool stuff from all that alien junk.

00:03:23.857 --> 00:03:25.567
I tell you what.

00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:27.819
Let's keep it.

00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:30.989
The world's changing.

00:03:34.993 --> 00:03:37.537
It's time we change, too.

00:04:00.602 --> 00:04:04.522

Showtime, a-holes!

00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:25.761
It will be here any minute.

00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:27.721
Which will be its loss.

00:05:27.921 --> 00:05:29.441
I thought your thing
was a sword?

00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:31.761
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...

00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:33.081
from feeding on those batteries,

00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:34.401
and I'm gonna
stop it with a sword?

00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:36.681
It's just, swords were your
thing and guns were mine.

00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:39.561
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:43.081
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:44.561
It hurts.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:45.761
It hurts?

00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:48.961
I have sensitive nipples.

00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:52.881
"My nipples hurt!
Oh, goodness me!"

00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:54.761
What about him? What's he doing?

00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:57.241
I'm finishing this so we can
listen to tunes while we work.

00:05:57.281 --> 00:05:58.721
How is that a priority?

00:05:58.801 --> 00:06:01.281
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:02.961
No, I actually agree
with Drax on this.

00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:04.521
That's hardly
important right now.

00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:06.961
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.001
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.481
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:15.961
I can clearly see you winking.

00:06:16.121 --> 00:06:18.401
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

00:06:24.241 --> 00:06:25.561
I am Groot.

00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.001
They were not
looking at you funny.

00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:34.321
Well, that's intense.

00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.561
Groot!

00:07:52.921 --> 00:07:55.241
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:56.401
Hi.

00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:41.121
No! Spit it out!

00:08:41.281 --> 00:08:42.481
Come on!

00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:46.881
Disgusting!

00:09:48.561 --> 00:09:51.441
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

00:09:51.881 --> 00:09:53.721
I must cut through
it from the inside.

00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:54.921
Huh?

00:09:55.001 --> 00:09:57.441
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

00:09:57.521 --> 00:09:58.561
Drax!

00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:09.561
What is he doing?

00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:12.601
He said the skin is too thick to be
pierced from the outside, so he...

00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:14.561
That doesn't make any sense!
I tried telling him that!

00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:15.881
Skin is the same
level of thickness

00:10:16.001 --> 00:10:17.241
from the inside as
from the outside!

00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:18.961
I realize that.

00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:24.721
There is a cut on its neck.

00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:27.121
Rocket, get it to look up.

00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:32.201
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey!
Up here!

00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:42.401
Watch it, Quill!

00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:31.361
Yes! I have single-handedly...

00:11:32.321 --> 00:11:33.641
vanquished the beast!

00:11:36.641 --> 00:11:37.801
What?

00:11:41.923 --> 00:11:43.508
<i>You got bit by a spider?</i>

00:11:43.674 --> 00:11:45.134
Can it bite me?

00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:47.136
Well, it probably
would've hurt, right?

00:11:47.303 --> 00:11:49.597
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.

00:11:49.764 --> 00:11:51.349
Maybe. How much did it hurt?

00:11:51.516 --> 00:11:53.726
The spider's dead, Ned.

00:11:56.938 --> 00:11:58.439
Whoa.

00:12:02.193 --> 00:12:04.070
You were here?

00:12:04.695 --> 00:12:06.197
Yeah.

00:12:06.989 --> 00:12:08.991
You could've died.

00:12:11.827 --> 00:12:14.080
- Do you lay eggs?
- What?

00:12:14.247 --> 00:12:15.248
No. Ha-ha.

00:12:17.667 --> 00:12:20.461
- Can you spit venom?
- No.

00:12:20.628 --> 00:12:22.922
Can you summon
an army of spiders?

00:12:23.089 --> 00:12:24.173
No, Ned.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.260
The Sokovia Accords
were put into place....

00:12:27.426 --> 00:12:29.720
How far can you shoot your webs?

00:12:29.887 --> 00:12:31.097
It's unknown. Shut up.

00:12:31.264 --> 00:12:32.515
to begin regulating....

00:12:32.682 --> 00:12:35.017
If I was you, I would
stand on a building...

00:12:35.184 --> 00:12:38.563
- ...and just shoot it as far as I could--
- Shut up, Ned.

00:12:38.729 --> 00:12:42.608
<i>Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're
in the classroom or on the battlefield...</i>

00:12:42.775 --> 00:12:44.443
- Do you know him too?
- Yeah, we met.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.070
<i>...fitness can be the difference
between success or failure.</i>

00:12:46.237 --> 00:12:48.322
- I stole his shield.
- What?

00:12:48.489 --> 00:12:50.533
<i>Today, my good friend,
your gym teacher...</i>

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.327
<i>...will conduct the Captain
America Fitness Challenge.</i>

00:12:53.494 --> 00:12:54.579
Thank you, Captain.

00:12:54.745 --> 00:12:57.790
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.

00:12:57.957 --> 00:13:00.167
It's required by the state.
Let's do it.

00:13:00.334 --> 00:13:01.836
- Do Avengers have to pay taxes?
- Shh!

00:13:02.003 --> 00:13:03.629
- What does Hulk smell like?
- Shh!

00:13:03.796 --> 00:13:05.798
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.

00:13:05.965 --> 00:13:08.676
Is Captain America cool, or is
he like a mean, old grandpa?

00:13:08.843 --> 00:13:10.761
Ned, just, shh, okay?

00:13:10.928 --> 00:13:14.432
- Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
- What?

00:13:14.599 --> 00:13:17.143
Yeah. You know how
there's a guy with a headset...

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.145
...telling the other
guy where to go?

00:13:19.312 --> 00:13:22.148
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.

00:13:22.315 --> 00:13:24.901
There'd be screens around
me, and I could swivel around.

00:13:25.067 --> 00:13:28.154
- I could be your guy in the chair.
- I don't need a guy in the chair.

00:13:28.321 --> 00:13:29.989
Looking good, Parker.

00:13:31.908 --> 00:13:35.661
Now, see, for me,
it would be F Thor...

00:13:35.828 --> 00:13:37.705
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.

00:13:37.872 --> 00:13:39.707
Well, what about the Spider-Man?

00:13:39.874 --> 00:13:41.083
It's just "Spider-Man."

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.462
Did you see the bank security cam
on YouTube? He fought off four guys.

00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:46.464
Oh, my God, she's
crushing on Spider-Man.

00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:47.715
No way.

00:13:47.882 --> 00:13:49.926
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.

00:13:51.177 --> 00:13:53.012
- He's probably 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.

00:13:53.179 --> 00:13:55.139
Like, what if he's
seriously burned?

00:13:55.306 --> 00:13:58.017
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.

00:13:58.184 --> 00:14:00.061
Peter knows Spider-Man.

00:14:02.855 --> 00:14:05.024
No, I don't. No. I-- I mean--

00:14:06.359 --> 00:14:07.527
They're friends.

00:14:07.693 --> 00:14:10.655
Yeah, like Coach Wilson and
Captain America are friends. Heh.

00:14:11.197 --> 00:14:13.533
I've met him, yeah.
A couple times.

00:14:14.033 --> 00:14:15.076
But it's, um...

00:14:15.952 --> 00:14:19.121
...through the Stark internship.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.749
Yeah, well, I'm not really
supposed to talk about it.

00:14:21.916 --> 00:14:23.793
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.629
Maybe you should invite him to Liz's party.
Right?

00:14:26.796 --> 00:14:30.091
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.

00:14:30.258 --> 00:14:32.677
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

00:14:32.844 --> 00:14:34.929
You should totally invite your
personal friend Spider-Man.

00:14:35.096 --> 00:14:37.348
- Um....
- It's okay.

00:14:37.515 --> 00:14:40.226
I know Peter's way too
busy for parties anyway, so....

00:14:40.393 --> 00:14:42.228
Come on. He'll be there.
Right, Parker?

00:14:48.901 --> 00:14:50.069
What are you doing?

00:14:50.236 --> 00:14:51.737
Helping you out.

00:14:51.904 --> 00:14:53.489
Did you not hear her?

00:14:53.656 --> 00:14:56.117
Liz has a crush on you.

00:14:58.995 --> 00:15:00.621
Dude, you're an Avenger.

00:15:00.788 --> 00:15:04.667
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.

00:15:13.602 --> 00:15:16.122
Our mission was
to bring back Klaue.

00:15:17.242 --> 00:15:18.562
We failed.

00:15:18.842 --> 00:15:21.962
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

00:15:22.122 --> 00:15:24.642
How do we justify bringing
him into our borders?

00:15:24.842 --> 00:15:26.082
He took a bullet for me.

00:15:26.242 --> 00:15:27.962
That was his choice.

00:15:28.682 --> 00:15:30.682
So now we are just
supposed to let him die?

00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:32.682
Let us consider
that we heal him.

00:15:33.282 --> 00:15:36.082
It is his duty to report
back to his country.

00:15:36.922 --> 00:15:38.922
And as king, it is your
duty to protect ours.

00:15:39.082 --> 00:15:41.522
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.

00:15:42.122 --> 00:15:45.322
I cannot just let him die...

00:15:46.122 --> 00:15:48.522
knowing we can save him.

00:15:48.722 --> 00:15:51.162
Where exactly are we taking him?

00:15:59.657 --> 00:16:00.897
He will live.

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:06.537
W'Kabi is here.

00:16:15.817 --> 00:16:18.137
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?

00:16:18.697 --> 00:16:20.257
He's not here.

00:16:24.137 --> 00:16:26.297
He slipped through our hands.

00:16:27.897 --> 00:16:29.097
"Slipped"?

00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:34.857
For 30 years, your father
was in power and did nothing.

00:16:35.017 --> 00:16:37.217
With you, I thought
it'd be different.

00:16:38.257 --> 00:16:40.097
But it's more of the same.

00:16:55.712 --> 00:16:56.992
Leave us!

00:17:07.912 --> 00:17:11.432
So your mission did
not go as planned.

00:17:12.512 --> 00:17:16.152
What happened to
my uncle N'Jobu?

00:17:16.912 --> 00:17:19.672
My father told me
he disappeared.

00:17:20.592 --> 00:17:22.232
There was a man today...

00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:27.112
wearing a ring
identical to this one.

00:17:28.672 --> 00:17:30.672
That is not possible.

00:17:31.152 --> 00:17:34.552
He helped Klaue escape from
us and he was wearing this ring!

00:17:34.712 --> 00:17:36.952
My grandfather's ring!

00:17:37.112 --> 00:17:38.672
Do not tell me what is possible.

00:17:38.752 --> 00:17:39.792
Tell me the truth!

00:17:44.592 --> 00:17:46.072
Some truths...

00:17:49.032 --> 00:17:52.552
are too much to bear, T'Challa.

00:17:53.552 --> 00:17:56.032
That is not your choice to make.

00:17:56.912 --> 00:17:57.872
What happened to him?

00:17:57.992 --> 00:17:59.552
I promised the king
to say nothing.

00:17:59.712 --> 00:18:01.552
I am your king now!

00:18:16.952 --> 00:18:19.512
Your uncle took...

00:18:20.752 --> 00:18:24.672
a War Dog assignment in America.

00:18:36.962 --> 00:18:38.322
- Lucky shot!
- That ain't lucky!

00:18:38.482 --> 00:18:39.842
Whatever! Get outta here!

00:18:39.962 --> 00:18:40.962
Check up.

00:18:41.042 --> 00:18:43.202
Pick your man up! He open.

00:18:44.362 --> 00:18:45.402
Where you at?

00:18:45.562 --> 00:18:47.362
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:18:47.562 --> 00:18:48.722
Pass! Pass!

00:18:48.882 --> 00:18:50.002
- Got you, E.
- E, hurry up!

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:51.682
Watch me get this.

00:18:52.162 --> 00:18:54.642
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.

00:18:54.722 --> 00:18:55.722
Come on.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:56.802
What you got?

00:18:56.882 --> 00:18:57.882
You ain't got nothing.

00:18:58.002 --> 00:18:59.922
Hey, look, if we
get in and out quick,

00:19:00.002 --> 00:19:01.002
won't be no worries.

00:19:01.162 --> 00:19:03.162
You in the van, come
in through from the west.

00:19:03.322 --> 00:19:04.482
Come around the corner.

00:19:04.562 --> 00:19:05.722
Land right here. Mmm-hmm.

00:19:05.882 --> 00:19:07.522
Me and the twins are
pulling up right here.

00:19:07.682 --> 00:19:09.802
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...

00:19:14.202 --> 00:19:15.202
Hide the straps.

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:25.562
Yo, is it the Feds?

00:19:28.442 --> 00:19:29.562
No.

00:19:41.522 --> 00:19:44.522
It's these two Grace
Jones-looking chicks.

00:19:45.082 --> 00:19:46.242
They're holding spears.

00:19:46.802 --> 00:19:47.762
Open it.

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:49.642
You serious?

00:19:50.242 --> 00:19:52.362
They won't knock again.

00:20:11.402 --> 00:20:13.552
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.

00:20:29.162 --> 00:20:30.482
Leave us.

00:20:30.602 --> 00:20:33.602
This is James.
I trust him with my life. He stays...

00:20:33.762 --> 00:20:35.882
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.

00:20:37.322 --> 00:20:38.482
As you wish.

00:20:38.642 --> 00:20:39.762
At ease.

00:20:52.522 --> 00:20:54.242
Let me see how
you are holding up.

00:21:03.242 --> 00:21:04.442
You look strong.

00:21:04.602 --> 00:21:06.522
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.

00:21:06.602 --> 00:21:07.602
How is home?

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:11.842
Not so good.

00:21:13.962 --> 00:21:15.362
There has been an attack.

00:21:15.762 --> 00:21:17.002
This man...

00:21:19.042 --> 00:21:20.082
Ulysses Klaue...

00:21:21.442 --> 00:21:23.482
stole a quarter ton
of vibranium from us...

00:21:23.642 --> 00:21:25.922
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.

00:21:28.242 --> 00:21:29.762
Many lives were lost.

00:21:31.122 --> 00:21:33.122
He knew where we
hid the vibranium...

00:21:33.282 --> 00:21:34.842
and how to strike.

00:21:35.442 --> 00:21:37.922
He had someone on the inside.

00:21:38.802 --> 00:21:40.082
Why are you here?

00:21:40.602 --> 00:21:43.562
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...

00:21:43.722 --> 00:21:46.642
and tell me why you
betrayed Wakanda.

00:21:46.802 --> 00:21:49.442
I did no such thing.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.842
Zuri, son of Badu...

00:21:56.042 --> 00:21:57.002
What?

00:22:02.682 --> 00:22:05.242
James. James, you lied to me?

00:22:05.322 --> 00:22:06.322
Leave him.

00:22:06.402 --> 00:22:07.402
You were Wakandan
this whole time?

00:22:07.482 --> 00:22:08.482
You betrayed Wakanda!

00:22:08.562 --> 00:22:09.602
How could you lie to me like...

00:22:09.722 --> 00:22:11.642
Stand down.

00:22:14.513 --> 00:22:15.713
<i>Your father...</i>

00:22:16.513 --> 00:22:18.233
placed me there...

00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:20.113
<i>to observe...</i>

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:23.713
unbeknownst to him.

00:22:23.913 --> 00:22:26.793
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

00:22:27.393 --> 00:22:28.633
They had a child.

00:22:30.073 --> 00:22:32.393
The hardships he saw there...

00:22:33.793 --> 00:22:35.873
radicalized your uncle.

00:22:36.033 --> 00:22:38.233
<i>I observed for
as long as I could.</i>

00:22:39.433 --> 00:22:41.073
Their leaders have
been assassinated.

00:22:41.233 --> 00:22:43.673
Communities flooded
with drugs and weapons.

00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:46.193
They are overly
policed and incarcerated.

00:22:46.673 --> 00:22:48.433
All over the planet...

00:22:48.593 --> 00:22:49.873
our people suffer because

00:22:49.953 --> 00:22:51.953
they don't have the
tools to fight back.

00:22:52.953 --> 00:22:54.273
With vibranium weapons,

00:22:54.353 --> 00:22:55.913
they could overthrow
every country...

00:22:56.073 --> 00:22:57.873
and Wakanda could rule them all

00:22:57.953 --> 00:22:59.273
the right way.

00:22:59.433 --> 00:23:02.953
He knew your father
would not support this.

00:23:03.833 --> 00:23:06.913
So, your uncle betrayed us.

00:23:07.073 --> 00:23:08.273
No!

00:23:08.433 --> 00:23:11.713
<i>He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.</i>

00:23:13.273 --> 00:23:14.673
No, no, no.

00:23:14.873 --> 00:23:16.433
You will return home at once...

00:23:16.593 --> 00:23:18.433
where you will
face the Council...

00:23:18.593 --> 00:23:21.553
and inform them of your crimes.

00:23:21.753 --> 00:23:23.433
<i>He drew his weapon on me.</i>

00:23:23.633 --> 00:23:25.873
No!

00:23:40.953 --> 00:23:44.713
<i>Your father killed
his own brother...</i>

00:23:44.873 --> 00:23:48.713
to save my life.

00:23:52.593 --> 00:23:55.793
Speak nothing of this.

00:24:00.073 --> 00:24:01.433
And the child?

00:24:05.273 --> 00:24:06.833
We left him.

00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:08.951
Check up!

00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:12.631
Guard your man, guard your man!

00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:15.625
Yo.

00:24:24.039 --> 00:24:25.239
We had to...

00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:27.519
maintain...

00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:30.279
the lie.

00:24:55.992 --> 00:24:57.392
What is this?

00:24:57.952 --> 00:24:59.432
Just a little gift.

00:25:37.168 --> 00:25:38.528
What are they called again?

00:25:39.008 --> 00:25:40.448
Anulax batteries.

00:25:40.608 --> 00:25:42.808
Harbulary batteries.

00:25:42.968 --> 00:25:45.288
That's nothing
like what I just said.

00:25:45.448 --> 00:25:47.248
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

00:25:47.328 --> 00:25:49.408
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.

00:25:49.488 --> 00:25:52.688
Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.

00:25:52.728 --> 00:25:54.728
The cost of
transgression is death.

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:58.208
We thank you, Guardians,

00:25:58.368 --> 00:26:00.248
for putting your
lives on the line.

00:26:00.408 --> 00:26:04.408
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

00:26:05.248 --> 00:26:09.128
Every citizen is born exactly
as designed by the community.

00:26:09.288 --> 00:26:12.408
Impeccable, both
physically and mentally.

00:26:12.608 --> 00:26:14.888
We control the DNA
of our progeny...

00:26:14.928 --> 00:26:17.288
germinating them
in birthing pods.

00:26:17.448 --> 00:26:20.928
I guess I prefer to make
people the old-fashioned way.

00:26:22.448 --> 00:26:24.648
Perhaps someday, you could
give me a history lesson...

00:26:25.128 --> 00:26:28.288
in the archaic ways
of our ancestors.

00:26:28.448 --> 00:26:30.568
For academic purposes.

00:26:30.728 --> 00:26:32.568
I would be honored, yes.

00:26:32.728 --> 00:26:34.728
In the name of research...

00:26:34.888 --> 00:26:37.408
I think that could
be pretty, uh...

00:26:37.568 --> 00:26:38.808
repulsive.

00:26:39.608 --> 00:26:41.088
I'm not into that
kind of casual...

00:26:41.248 --> 00:26:42.288
Oh, please.

00:26:42.448 --> 00:26:45.768
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

00:26:45.928 --> 00:26:47.248
Bring it...

00:26:47.408 --> 00:26:49.008
and we shall gladly
be on our way.

00:27:02.928 --> 00:27:05.368
Family reunion. Yay.

00:27:05.528 --> 00:27:07.968
I understand she is your sister.

00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:12.448
She's worth no more to me than
the bounty due for her on Xandar.

00:27:12.808 --> 00:27:17.008
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

00:27:18.008 --> 00:27:19.968
Do with her as you please.

00:27:23.448 --> 00:27:25.248
We thank you,
High Priestess Ayesha.

00:27:25.608 --> 00:27:28.168
What is your heritage,
Mr. Quill?

00:27:31.448 --> 00:27:32.968
My mother is from Earth.

00:27:33.248 --> 00:27:35.048
And your father?

00:27:36.568 --> 00:27:39.568
He ain't from Missouri.
That's all I know.

00:27:39.728 --> 00:27:41.168
I see it within you.

00:27:41.688 --> 00:27:44.888
An unorthodox genealogy.

00:27:45.048 --> 00:27:49.288
A hybrid that
seems particularly...

00:27:50.248 --> 00:27:51.808
reckless.

00:27:52.808 --> 00:27:55.928
You know, they told me you
people were conceited douchebags...

00:27:57.168 --> 00:27:58.648
but that isn't true at all.

00:28:03.528 --> 00:28:04.528
Oh, shit.

00:28:04.728 --> 00:28:06.768
I'm using my wrong
eye again, aren't I?

00:28:06.928 --> 00:28:09.288
I'm sorry. That was meant
to be behind your back.

00:28:11.288 --> 00:28:12.968
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

00:28:13.128 --> 00:28:14.848
You're telling me.

00:28:15.008 --> 00:28:17.088
You wanna buy some batteries?

00:28:28.888 --> 00:28:31.368
<i>All right, let's get
baldy to Xandar</i>

00:28:31.448 --> 00:28:32.888
<i>and collect that bounty.</i>

00:29:25.128 --> 00:29:27.288
That stuff about my father...

00:29:27.448 --> 00:29:29.448
Who does she think she is?

00:29:29.608 --> 00:29:31.928
I know you're
sensitive about that.

00:29:32.088 --> 00:29:34.248
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

00:29:35.968 --> 00:29:38.968
Sorry if it seemed like I was
flirting with the High Priestess.

00:29:39.328 --> 00:29:40.728
I wasn't.

00:29:40.888 --> 00:29:42.968
I don't care if you were.

00:29:43.128 --> 00:29:44.928
Well, I feel like you do care.

00:29:45.088 --> 00:29:47.488
That's why I'm apologizing.
So, sorry!

00:29:47.648 --> 00:29:49.848
Gamora is not the
one for you, Quill.

00:29:50.648 --> 00:29:51.768
Damn shadow.

00:29:52.048 --> 00:29:54.088
There are two types of
beings in the universe...

00:29:54.168 --> 00:29:55.928
those who dance,
and those who do not.

00:29:56.288 --> 00:29:58.008
Mmm-hmm.

00:29:58.248 --> 00:30:00.208
I first met my
beloved at a war rally.

00:30:00.368 --> 00:30:01.408
Oh, God.

00:30:01.448 --> 00:30:04.408
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.

00:30:04.448 --> 00:30:06.128
Except one woman.

00:30:06.408 --> 00:30:07.848
My Ovette.

00:30:08.608 --> 00:30:10.808
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

00:30:10.968 --> 00:30:13.608
The most melodic song in
the world could be playing.

00:30:14.088 --> 00:30:16.328
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

00:30:17.168 --> 00:30:19.288
Wouldn't move a muscle.

00:30:19.448 --> 00:30:22.168
One might assume she was dead.

00:30:22.328 --> 00:30:23.808
That does sound pretty hot.

00:30:24.328 --> 00:30:26.968
It would make my
nether regions engorge.

00:30:27.128 --> 00:30:29.008
Okay. I get it, yes.

00:30:29.168 --> 00:30:31.088
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

00:30:31.128 --> 00:30:34.808
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

00:30:36.168 --> 00:30:37.168
Mmm.

00:30:40.248 --> 00:30:43.088
I'm hungry. Hand me
some of that yaro root.

00:30:43.248 --> 00:30:44.688
No. It's not ripe yet...

00:30:44.888 --> 00:30:45.928
and I hate you.

00:30:46.088 --> 00:30:47.288
You hate me?

00:30:47.448 --> 00:30:50.128
You left me there while you
stole that stone for yourself.

00:30:50.288 --> 00:30:52.448
And yet here you stand, a hero.

00:30:52.608 --> 00:30:54.008
I will be free of these shackles

00:30:54.128 --> 00:30:55.448
soon enough,
and I will kill you.

00:30:55.888 --> 00:30:57.128
I swear.

00:30:57.288 --> 00:30:58.368
No.

00:30:58.568 --> 00:31:00.368
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days

00:31:00.488 --> 00:31:01.968
in a prison on Xandar...

00:31:02.128 --> 00:31:03.568
wishing you could.

00:31:06.109 --> 00:31:08.069
House party in the suburbs.

00:31:08.236 --> 00:31:11.615
Oh, I remember these.
Kind of jealous.

00:31:11.782 --> 00:31:14.409
It'll be a night to remember.

00:31:14.576 --> 00:31:17.287
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.

00:31:17.454 --> 00:31:19.414
Yeah, it gives me confidence.

00:31:19.581 --> 00:31:20.791
This is a mistake.

00:31:20.957 --> 00:31:22.209
Hey, let's just go home.

00:31:22.375 --> 00:31:23.835
Oh, Peter.

00:31:24.002 --> 00:31:26.755
I know.
I know it's really hard...

00:31:26.922 --> 00:31:30.175
...trying to fit in with all the
changes your body's going through.

00:31:30.342 --> 00:31:31.384
It's flowering now.

00:31:31.593 --> 00:31:32.969
Uh-huh. Heh, heh.

00:31:33.637 --> 00:31:35.639
He's so stressed out lately.

00:31:35.806 --> 00:31:37.390
What helps with
stress is a party.

00:31:37.557 --> 00:31:40.435
- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.480
Peter.

00:31:44.189 --> 00:31:46.399
- Have fun, okay?
- I will.

00:31:46.566 --> 00:31:47.567
Bye, May.

00:31:49.528 --> 00:31:50.529
Come dance with me!

00:31:50.695 --> 00:31:52.531
Dude, you have the suit, right?

00:31:52.697 --> 00:31:54.950
- Yeah.
- This is gonna change our lives.

00:31:59.871 --> 00:32:01.790
- Annie, over here!
- Hey.

00:32:01.957 --> 00:32:03.125
Hey.

00:32:06.753 --> 00:32:08.880
<i>DJ Flash.</i>

00:32:09.047 --> 00:32:11.258
Okay.
We're gonna have Spider-Man swing in...

00:32:11.424 --> 00:32:15.387
...say you guys are tight, and I get a
fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.

00:32:15.554 --> 00:32:17.681
Can't believe you're
at this lame party.

00:32:17.848 --> 00:32:19.057
But you're here too.

00:32:20.225 --> 00:32:21.768
Am I?

00:32:24.271 --> 00:32:27.524
Oh, my gosh. Hey, guys.
Cool hat, Ned.

00:32:27.691 --> 00:32:29.443
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.

00:32:29.609 --> 00:32:31.486
I'm so happy you guys came.

00:32:31.653 --> 00:32:34.156
There's pizza and drinks.
Help yourself.

00:32:35.157 --> 00:32:37.617
- What a great party.
- Thanks.

00:32:40.287 --> 00:32:41.538
Oh, I--

00:32:41.705 --> 00:32:44.374
My parents will kill me if
anything's broken. I gotta--

00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:46.001
- Yeah.
- Have fun.

00:32:46.168 --> 00:32:48.128
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:32:48.295 --> 00:32:50.297
Dude, what are you doing?

00:32:50.464 --> 00:32:52.549
She's here. Spider it up.

00:32:52.716 --> 00:32:55.343
No, no, no.
I can't-- I cannot do this.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.762
Spider-Man is not
a party trick, okay?

00:32:57.929 --> 00:33:00.599
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.

00:33:01.349 --> 00:33:03.059
Peter, no one wants that.

00:33:03.435 --> 00:33:05.020
Dude.

00:33:05.437 --> 00:33:08.315
Penis Parker, what's up?

00:33:08.815 --> 00:33:10.317
So where's your pal Spider-Man?

00:33:10.484 --> 00:33:13.028
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?

00:33:14.738 --> 00:33:17.741
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.

00:33:26.458 --> 00:33:28.376
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man."

00:33:28.543 --> 00:33:31.588
"Just thought I'd swing by and
say hello to my buddy Peter."

00:33:31.755 --> 00:33:33.924
"Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?"

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.383
"He must be around...."

00:33:40.472 --> 00:33:43.350
God, this is stupid.
What am I doing?

00:33:52.442 --> 00:33:53.568
What the hell?

00:34:00.617 --> 00:34:02.828
Whoo! Unh!

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.133
This sucks.

00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:21.429
Whoo! Ha-ha-ha.

00:34:21.596 --> 00:34:25.684
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.

00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:27.144
Here. You try.

00:34:28.937 --> 00:34:32.107
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?

00:34:32.274 --> 00:34:34.359
Okay, okay.
I got what you need, all right?

00:34:34.526 --> 00:34:37.320
I got tons of great stuff here.
One sec.

00:34:38.071 --> 00:34:42.534
Okay, I got, uh, black-hole
grenades, Chitauri railguns....

00:34:42.701 --> 00:34:44.786
You letting off shots in public now?
Hurry up.

00:34:44.953 --> 00:34:48.582
Look, times are changing. We're the
only ones selling these high-tech weapons.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:52.002
Oh, this must be where the
ATM robbers got their stuff.

00:34:52.169 --> 00:34:56.548
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.

00:34:56.715 --> 00:34:58.925
I got antigrav climbers.

00:34:59.092 --> 00:35:00.218
Yo, climbers?

00:35:02.679 --> 00:35:03.972
Okay, what the hell is that?

00:35:06.433 --> 00:35:08.143
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.

00:35:11.271 --> 00:35:14.483
Hey! Hey, come on.
You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me.

00:35:14.649 --> 00:35:15.776
All right.

00:35:16.985 --> 00:35:17.986
Unh!

00:35:18.153 --> 00:35:19.696
Aah! Aah!

00:35:28.288 --> 00:35:30.415
What was that?

00:35:31.374 --> 00:35:32.959
Oh, no, no! Unh!

00:35:37.088 --> 00:35:38.924
What--? Aah!

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.721
- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.640
Aah! Unh!

00:35:50.519 --> 00:35:51.686
Did you just do it again?

00:35:51.853 --> 00:35:54.022
- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.

00:36:02.989 --> 00:36:03.990
Toomes' phone.

00:36:06.118 --> 00:36:07.661
Boss.

00:36:07.828 --> 00:36:10.038
Oh, my butt! Unh!

00:36:28.974 --> 00:36:31.810
Great.
Guess I'm gonna have to take a shortcut.

00:36:34.563 --> 00:36:36.606
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.

00:36:36.773 --> 00:36:38.525
Hey, hey, buddy.

00:36:38.692 --> 00:36:41.194
Sorry, no time to play.
Here, go fetch.

00:36:41.403 --> 00:36:44.865
Whoo! Now, this is more like it.

00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:46.324
Whoa!

00:36:54.416 --> 00:36:57.669
Whoa! Whoo! Whoo!

00:36:57.836 --> 00:36:59.337
Smells really good.

00:36:59.546 --> 00:37:02.048
<i>♪ Oh, yeah ♪♪</i>

00:37:03.008 --> 00:37:04.509
Great movie!

00:37:09.764 --> 00:37:12.017
Ugh.... Oh, hey, guys.

00:37:12.184 --> 00:37:15.145
- Aah!
- No! No!

00:37:15.312 --> 00:37:16.980
<i>Hey, it's Peter.
Leave a message.</i>

00:37:18.356 --> 00:37:19.691
Peter, where are you?

00:37:19.858 --> 00:37:21.735
The hat's not working.
This is not cool.

00:37:22.778 --> 00:37:24.154
Almost got you.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.252
Thought you got away
from me, didn't you?

00:37:39.961 --> 00:37:42.380
I got you right
where I want you.

00:37:42.756 --> 00:37:44.633
Surprise!

00:37:47.928 --> 00:37:49.721
What the hell?

00:38:34.975 --> 00:38:36.268
Huh?

00:38:36.434 --> 00:38:38.728
Oh, hey.

00:39:27.572 --> 00:39:29.052
All right, where am I?

00:39:29.612 --> 00:39:31.852
Don't scare me
like that, colonizer!

00:39:32.452 --> 00:39:34.172
What? My name is Everett.

00:39:34.612 --> 00:39:37.492
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

00:39:37.652 --> 00:39:40.452
former air force
pilot and now CIA.

00:39:40.932 --> 00:39:41.972
Right.

00:39:46.692 --> 00:39:48.132
Okay, is this Wakanda?

00:39:48.292 --> 00:39:49.892
No, it's Kansas.

00:39:53.092 --> 00:39:54.772
How long ago was Korea?

00:39:54.932 --> 00:39:56.052
Yesterday.

00:39:56.212 --> 00:39:57.212
I don't think so.

00:39:57.292 --> 00:39:59.532
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

00:39:59.652 --> 00:40:01.852
They do here.

00:40:02.012 --> 00:40:05.252
But not by magic, by technology.

00:40:09.532 --> 00:40:12.932
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

00:40:36.652 --> 00:40:39.132
These train things...

00:40:39.252 --> 00:40:41.492
that's magnetic
levitation, right?

00:40:41.652 --> 00:40:42.732
Obviously.

00:40:42.892 --> 00:40:47.132
Obviously, but I've
never seen it this efficient.

00:40:49.772 --> 00:40:50.932
The light panels, what are they?

00:40:51.412 --> 00:40:53.612
<i>Sonic stabilizers. Sonic what?</i>

00:40:53.972 --> 00:40:55.252
In its raw form...

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:57.052
vibranium is too dangerous

00:40:57.132 --> 00:40:58.892
to be transported
at that speed...

00:40:59.052 --> 00:41:02.132
so I developed a way to
temporarily deactivate it.

00:41:03.292 --> 00:41:04.772
<i>There's vibranium
on those trains?</i>

00:41:04.932 --> 00:41:07.172
There's vibranium all around us.

00:41:08.892 --> 00:41:10.492
That's how I healed you.

00:41:18.612 --> 00:41:20.012
<i>Where is T'Challa?</i>

00:41:20.212 --> 00:41:22.172
<i>His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.</i>

00:41:22.332 --> 00:41:24.612
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.

00:41:24.772 --> 00:41:26.052
<i>A man showed up at the border</i>

00:41:26.132 --> 00:41:27.412
<i>who claims to have killed Klaue.</i>

00:41:27.572 --> 00:41:28.612
What?

00:41:28.692 --> 00:41:31.212
<i>W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.</i>

00:41:31.372 --> 00:41:33.252
<i>We need to find your brother!</i>

00:41:33.412 --> 00:41:34.452
An outsider?

00:41:34.612 --> 00:41:36.212
<i>No, a Wakandan.</i>

00:41:36.412 --> 00:41:37.812
He's not a Wakandan.

00:41:40.452 --> 00:41:41.652
He's one of ours.

00:41:54.652 --> 00:41:56.692
He killed his own brother...

00:41:56.852 --> 00:41:59.052
and left a child behind...

00:41:59.212 --> 00:42:00.452
with nothing.

00:42:02.412 --> 00:42:04.012
What kind of king...

00:42:05.932 --> 00:42:08.092
What kind of man does that?

00:42:08.252 --> 00:42:10.452
No man is perfect.

00:42:11.332 --> 00:42:12.692
Not even your father.

00:42:12.852 --> 00:42:15.612
He didn't even give
him a proper burial.

00:42:17.492 --> 00:42:20.572
My uncle N'Jobu
betrayed us, but my father...

00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:24.012
he may have created
something even worse.

00:42:24.452 --> 00:42:25.452
Hey.

00:42:27.292 --> 00:42:28.452
Look at me.

00:42:31.572 --> 00:42:35.572
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

00:42:37.212 --> 00:42:41.852
You get to decide what kind
of king you are going to be.

00:42:47.892 --> 00:42:50.452
<i>Brother, you need
to get here now!</i>

00:42:50.892 --> 00:42:52.172
Erik Stevens.

00:42:52.892 --> 00:42:54.852
Graduated Annapolis age 19...

00:42:55.012 --> 00:42:56.972
MIT for grad school.

00:42:57.132 --> 00:42:59.332
Joined the SEALs and
went straight to Afghanistan...

00:42:59.492 --> 00:43:00.892
where he wrapped
up confirmed kills,

00:43:00.972 --> 00:43:02.052
like it was a video game.

00:43:02.532 --> 00:43:04.292
Started calling him Killmonger.

00:43:04.452 --> 00:43:07.092
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.

00:43:07.292 --> 00:43:08.692
They will drop off the grid...

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:10.132
so they can commit
assassinations

00:43:10.212 --> 00:43:11.332
and take down governments.

00:43:12.172 --> 00:43:15.532
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

00:43:15.852 --> 00:43:17.372
He has a War Dog tattoo...

00:43:18.052 --> 00:43:20.612
but we have no record of him.

00:43:26.851 --> 00:43:28.960
Is this man Wakandan or not?

00:43:52.983 --> 00:43:53.882
Speak.

00:43:55.953 --> 00:43:58.193
I'm standing in your house...

00:43:58.353 --> 00:43:59.753
serving justice to a man

00:43:59.833 --> 00:44:02.113
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.

00:44:02.953 --> 00:44:04.233
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:12.273
I don't care that
you brought Klaue.

00:44:12.473 --> 00:44:14.793
Only reason I don't
kill you where you stand

00:44:14.873 --> 00:44:16.913
is because I know who you are.

00:44:18.193 --> 00:44:19.873
Now, what do you want?

00:44:21.433 --> 00:44:23.193
I want the throne.

00:44:28.473 --> 00:44:30.673
Y'all sittin' up
here comfortable.

00:44:31.313 --> 00:44:32.793
Must feel good.

00:44:33.513 --> 00:44:35.033
It's about two billion people

00:44:35.113 --> 00:44:36.713
all over the world
that looks like us.

00:44:37.313 --> 00:44:39.273
But their lives
are a lot harder.

00:44:39.433 --> 00:44:41.753
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.

00:44:41.913 --> 00:44:44.113
And what tools are those?

00:44:44.713 --> 00:44:47.353
Vibranium. Your weapons.

00:44:47.513 --> 00:44:51.113
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

00:44:51.393 --> 00:44:55.033
It is not our way to be judge,
jury, and executioner...

00:44:55.193 --> 00:44:57.033
for people who are not our own.

00:44:57.633 --> 00:44:59.073
Not your own?

00:44:59.233 --> 00:45:01.713
But didn't life start right
here on this continent?

00:45:01.873 --> 00:45:03.313
So ain't all people your people?

00:45:03.473 --> 00:45:07.113
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.

00:45:07.993 --> 00:45:09.873
And it is my responsibility

00:45:09.953 --> 00:45:11.833
to make sure our
people are safe...

00:45:11.993 --> 00:45:14.233
and that vibranium does not fall

00:45:14.313 --> 00:45:16.113
into the hands of
a person like you.

00:45:16.273 --> 00:45:17.273
- Mmm...
- Son.

00:45:17.793 --> 00:45:20.153
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.

00:45:20.233 --> 00:45:22.073
Reject his request.

00:45:22.233 --> 00:45:24.713
Oh, I ain't requesting nothing.

00:45:24.913 --> 00:45:27.553
Ask who I am.
You're Erik Stevens.

00:45:29.033 --> 00:45:30.393
An American black operative.

00:45:30.553 --> 00:45:32.233
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.

00:45:32.313 --> 00:45:33.313
That's who you are.

00:45:33.513 --> 00:45:35.033
That's not my name, Princess.

00:45:35.553 --> 00:45:36.793
Ask me, King.

00:45:36.953 --> 00:45:38.113
No.

00:45:39.233 --> 00:45:40.393
Ask me.

00:45:42.713 --> 00:45:44.113
Take him away.

00:45:53.433 --> 00:45:54.393
I found my daddy

00:45:54.473 --> 00:45:55.513
with Panther claws in his chest!

00:45:55.593 --> 00:45:57.673
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.

00:45:59.153 --> 00:46:01.113
- Lies!
- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:04.673
What?

00:46:08.593 --> 00:46:10.033
Hey, Auntie.

00:46:13.513 --> 00:46:15.393
I'm exercising my blood right

00:46:15.513 --> 00:46:17.153
to challenge for
the mantles of king...

00:46:17.313 --> 00:46:18.913
and Black Panther.

00:46:23.633 --> 00:46:24.993
Do not do this, T'Challa.

00:46:25.153 --> 00:46:27.353
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,

00:46:27.433 --> 00:46:29.033
he is within his rights.

00:46:29.193 --> 00:46:30.553
He has no rights here!

00:46:30.713 --> 00:46:32.793
The challenge will
take weeks to prepare.

00:46:32.953 --> 00:46:36.193
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

00:46:36.353 --> 00:46:38.593
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.

00:46:38.753 --> 00:46:40.953
And somebody to get
me outta these chains.

00:46:44.993 --> 00:46:47.873
T'Challa, what do
you know of this?

00:46:49.153 --> 00:46:51.593
I accept your challenge.

00:46:58.986 --> 00:47:00.106
This is weird.

00:47:00.186 --> 00:47:01.986
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

00:47:02.066 --> 00:47:03.066
Why would they do that?

00:47:03.106 --> 00:47:04.826
Probably because Rocket
stole some of their batteries.

00:47:04.906 --> 00:47:05.906
Dude!

00:47:06.306 --> 00:47:07.306
Right.

00:47:07.466 --> 00:47:08.666
He didn't steal some of those.

00:47:08.746 --> 00:47:10.586
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

00:47:21.706 --> 00:47:23.506
What were you thinking?

00:47:23.666 --> 00:47:25.066
Dude, they were
really easy to steal!

00:47:25.106 --> 00:47:26.626
That's your defense? Come on!

00:47:26.706 --> 00:47:29.146
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:30.866
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

00:47:31.666 --> 00:47:34.266
Oh, I didn't realize your
motivation was altruism.

00:47:34.426 --> 00:47:35.626
It's really a shame

00:47:35.706 --> 00:47:36.866
the Sovereign have
mistaken your intentions...

00:47:36.986 --> 00:47:38.706
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

00:47:38.786 --> 00:47:40.586
I was being sarcastic!

00:47:40.626 --> 00:47:41.786
Oh, no!

00:47:41.866 --> 00:47:43.186
You're supposed to
use a sarcastic voice!

00:47:43.266 --> 00:47:44.266
Now I look foolish!

00:47:44.586 --> 00:47:45.866
Can we put the
bickering on hold...

00:47:46.026 --> 00:47:48.066
until after we survive
this massive space battle?

00:47:48.226 --> 00:47:49.986
- More incoming!
- Good!

00:47:50.026 --> 00:47:51.506
I wanna kill some guys!

00:47:59.386 --> 00:48:00.826
You're not killing anyone.

00:48:00.866 --> 00:48:02.626
All those ships are
remotely piloted.

00:48:05.906 --> 00:48:06.906
Damn it!

00:48:17.626 --> 00:48:19.506
What is the delay, Admiral?

00:48:19.666 --> 00:48:23.786
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...

00:48:23.946 --> 00:48:25.186
and could destroy
the entire fleet.

00:48:25.226 --> 00:48:27.986
Our concern is their
slight against our people.

00:48:28.666 --> 00:48:31.826
We hired them and
they steal from us.

00:48:32.906 --> 00:48:34.426
It is heresy of
the highest order.

00:48:36.266 --> 00:48:38.306
<i>All command modules...</i>

00:48:38.506 --> 00:48:41.026
<i>fire with the intent to kill.</i>

00:48:50.426 --> 00:48:52.306
What's the nearest
habitable planet?

00:48:53.266 --> 00:48:54.586
It's called Berhert.

00:48:54.746 --> 00:48:56.506
How many jumps? Only one.

00:48:56.546 --> 00:48:59.666
But the access point
is 47 clicks away.

00:48:59.826 --> 00:49:02.666
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

00:49:12.066 --> 00:49:13.386
Quill, to make
it through that...

00:49:13.466 --> 00:49:15.146
you'd have to be the
greatest pilot in the universe.

00:49:15.306 --> 00:49:16.306
Lucky for us, I...

00:49:16.466 --> 00:49:17.946
I am.

00:49:30.466 --> 00:49:31.466
What are you doing?

00:49:31.626 --> 00:49:33.746
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

00:49:33.826 --> 00:49:36.866
I was cybernetically
engineered to pilot a spacecraft.

00:49:37.066 --> 00:49:39.666
You were cybernetically
engineered to be a douchebag!

00:49:40.186 --> 00:49:41.186
Stop it.

00:49:41.306 --> 00:49:43.106
Later on tonight, you're gonna
be laying down in your bed...

00:49:43.186 --> 00:49:45.266
and there's gonna be something
squishy in your pillow case.

00:49:45.346 --> 00:49:46.706
And you're gonna
be like, "What's this?"

00:49:46.906 --> 00:49:48.666
And it's gonna be
because I put a turd in there!

00:49:50.346 --> 00:49:52.546
You put your turd in
my bed, I shave you.

00:49:52.746 --> 00:49:54.106
Oh, it won't be my turd.

00:49:54.266 --> 00:49:55.706
It will be Drax's.

00:49:58.146 --> 00:50:00.106
I have famously huge turds.

00:50:00.266 --> 00:50:02.666
We're about to die, and
this is what we're discussing?

00:50:05.386 --> 00:50:06.346
Son of a...

00:50:06.546 --> 00:50:08.106
Dude! Seriously!

00:50:08.666 --> 00:50:09.666
Hey! Let me...

00:50:24.026 --> 00:50:25.346
Idiots!

00:50:25.506 --> 00:50:26.826
Well, that's what you get

00:50:26.946 --> 00:50:28.186
when Quill flies.

00:50:28.266 --> 00:50:29.626
Ow!

00:50:29.906 --> 00:50:32.146
We still have a
Sovereign craft behind us.

00:50:34.986 --> 00:50:36.826
Our weapons are down.

00:50:36.986 --> 00:50:39.066
20 clicks to the jump!

00:50:42.026 --> 00:50:43.026
Hold on.

00:50:53.466 --> 00:50:55.586
It's not ripe.

00:51:03.386 --> 00:51:05.546
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

00:51:09.066 --> 00:51:10.826
Yes!

00:51:11.986 --> 00:51:14.026
15 clicks to the jump!

00:51:14.466 --> 00:51:15.546
Come on!

00:51:16.346 --> 00:51:17.946
Keep going!

00:51:32.146 --> 00:51:33.386
10 clicks!

00:51:36.946 --> 00:51:38.706
Die, spaceship!

00:51:43.506 --> 00:51:44.746
You suck, Zylak.

00:51:44.906 --> 00:51:45.946
Typical.

00:51:48.706 --> 00:51:49.706
Five clicks!

00:51:55.466 --> 00:51:57.026
Son of a...

00:51:57.426 --> 00:51:59.346
They went around the field!

00:52:13.626 --> 00:52:15.946
Someone destroyed all our ships!

00:52:16.106 --> 00:52:17.386
What?

00:52:20.106 --> 00:52:22.026
Who?

00:52:22.946 --> 00:52:24.426
One click!

00:52:25.586 --> 00:52:27.306
What is that? Who cares?

00:52:27.466 --> 00:52:28.906
That's the jump point! Go!

00:52:32.546 --> 00:52:34.306
It's a guy.

00:52:41.306 --> 00:52:42.306
Oh, my God.

00:52:42.466 --> 00:52:43.906
He's still out there?

00:53:11.026 --> 00:53:13.146
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

00:53:13.986 --> 00:53:16.306
Prepare for a
really bad landing!

00:53:56.986 --> 00:53:58.906
That was awesome!

00:54:00.386 --> 00:54:01.386
Yes!

00:54:02.143 --> 00:54:05.188
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...

00:54:05.355 --> 00:54:08.900
...and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.

00:54:09.401 --> 00:54:11.903
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:13.905
<i>I put everything in your suit.</i>

00:54:14.072 --> 00:54:15.407
<i>Including this heater.</i>

00:54:15.865 --> 00:54:17.951
Whoa!

00:54:18.118 --> 00:54:19.953
Whew, that's better. Thanks.

00:54:21.287 --> 00:54:22.414
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:25.875
The guy with wings is the source of
the weapons. I gotta take him down.

00:54:26.042 --> 00:54:27.710
<i>Take him down now, huh?</i>

00:54:27.877 --> 00:54:30.672
<i>Steady, Crockett, there are people
who handle this sort of thing.</i>

00:54:30.839 --> 00:54:33.675
- The Avengers?
<i>- No. This is a little below their pay grade.</i>

00:54:33.842 --> 00:54:35.844
Mr.
Stark, you didn't have to come out here.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:37.429
I had that. I was fine.

00:54:38.054 --> 00:54:41.015
<i>Oh, I'm not here.</i>

00:54:41.891 --> 00:54:43.685
Thank God this
place has Wi-Fi...

00:54:43.852 --> 00:54:45.687
...or you would
be toast right now.

00:54:45.854 --> 00:54:48.815
Thank Ganesh while you're at it.
Cheers.

00:54:48.982 --> 00:54:51.151
<i>Look, forget the flying
vulture guy, please.</i>

00:54:51.317 --> 00:54:52.360
- Why?
<i>- Why?</i>

00:54:52.527 --> 00:54:54.571
Because I said so!

00:54:54.738 --> 00:54:57.592
Sorry, I'm talking
to a teenager.

00:54:57.709 --> 00:55:01.545
<i>Stay close to the ground.
Build up your game helping little people</i>

00:55:01.569 --> 00:55:03.580
like that lady that
bought you the churro.

00:55:04.205 --> 00:55:07.125
Can't you just be a friendly...

00:55:07.751 --> 00:55:09.127
...neighborhood Spider-Man?

00:55:09.294 --> 00:55:11.004
But I'm ready for
more than that now.

00:55:11.504 --> 00:55:12.547
<i>No, you're not.</i>

00:55:12.714 --> 00:55:15.008
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.

00:55:15.175 --> 00:55:17.802
<i>Trust me, kid.
If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would've.</i>

00:55:18.219 --> 00:55:21.431
<i>Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.</i>

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:24.163
Are you driving?

00:55:24.376 --> 00:55:27.379
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.

00:55:27.608 --> 00:55:29.360
I got some pull at MIT.
End call.

00:55:31.024 --> 00:55:32.317
No, I don't need to go to--

00:55:32.484 --> 00:55:34.527
<i>Mr. Stark is no longer connected.</i>

00:55:37.238 --> 00:55:39.074
That's awesome.

00:55:41.701 --> 00:55:45.163
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?

00:55:55.882 --> 00:55:57.467
Whoa.

00:56:04.265 --> 00:56:05.892
Hey, what's up?
I'm on my way back.

00:56:06.059 --> 00:56:09.270
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.

00:56:09.437 --> 00:56:11.648
When I say "penis,"
you say "Parker."

00:56:11.815 --> 00:56:12.816
- Penis!
- Parker!

00:56:12.982 --> 00:56:14.192
- Penis!
- Parker!

00:56:14.692 --> 00:56:16.903
<i>Sorry, Peter.
I guess we're still losers.</i>

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:20.031
<i>- I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.

00:56:46.683 --> 00:56:48.268
Whoa.

00:56:48.435 --> 00:56:49.436
Whoa, whoa.

00:57:00.071 --> 00:57:01.781
Idiots.

00:57:02.615 --> 00:57:03.742
Idiots.

00:57:03.908 --> 00:57:05.452
Idiots!

00:57:06.286 --> 00:57:07.328
Boss?

00:57:07.662 --> 00:57:10.957
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.

00:57:11.374 --> 00:57:13.543
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?

00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:14.961
Oh. Sorry. You left it out.

00:57:15.128 --> 00:57:16.963
You know I'm a curious
person by nature.

00:57:19.007 --> 00:57:22.010
I finished designing that
high-altitude vacuum seal.

00:57:22.218 --> 00:57:23.219
Huh?

00:57:23.386 --> 00:57:26.264
In case you want to, you
know, go for the big one?

00:57:26.431 --> 00:57:28.475
You're still on that?
I told you, no.

00:57:28.641 --> 00:57:30.185
The answer's no. Forget it.

00:57:34.439 --> 00:57:36.900
Ha-ha-ha! Whoo!

00:57:39.736 --> 00:57:41.321
Ha-ha.

00:57:41.863 --> 00:57:44.324
I mean, that was badass. Ha.

00:57:46.951 --> 00:57:50.830
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?

00:57:50.997 --> 00:57:53.541
- You said, move the merchandise.
- Under the radar.

00:57:53.708 --> 00:57:54.918
Under the radar!

00:57:55.085 --> 00:57:56.836
That's how we survive.

00:57:57.003 --> 00:58:00.340
If you bring Damage Control or the
Avengers down here, we're through.

00:58:00.965 --> 00:58:03.927
You're out there wearing that
goofy thing, lighting up cars...

00:58:04.094 --> 00:58:05.595
...calling yourself the Shocker.

00:58:05.762 --> 00:58:08.890
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?

00:58:09.057 --> 00:58:10.850
Ah, whatever, old man. Come on.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:13.728
Look.

00:58:13.895 --> 00:58:15.313
Look.

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.149
I know you don't give
a crap about anything.

00:58:18.316 --> 00:58:19.943
But I do.

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:23.238
I built this whole place because
I got people I have to look after.

00:58:23.405 --> 00:58:26.616
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:28.868 --> 00:58:30.286
You know what?

00:58:30.453 --> 00:58:33.123
I can't afford your bullshit.

00:58:33.289 --> 00:58:34.749
- Get out of here.
- What?

00:58:34.916 --> 00:58:38.211
- You're done. You're off the crew.
- Yeah, all right.

00:58:39.087 --> 00:58:40.130
All right. Heh.

00:58:40.296 --> 00:58:42.715
Wonder if you can afford
me out there, though, right?

00:58:42.882 --> 00:58:44.717
With everything I know.

00:58:45.677 --> 00:58:48.513
- Excuse me?
- Uh, I'm just saying...

00:58:48.847 --> 00:58:52.517
...maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.

00:58:53.309 --> 00:58:54.936
- You know what?
- What?

00:58:55.311 --> 00:58:56.479
You're right.

00:58:56.646 --> 00:58:58.106
- That work?
- I don't know.

00:58:59.399 --> 00:59:00.942
I can't afford that.

00:59:01.151 --> 00:59:03.653
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

00:59:10.285 --> 00:59:11.786
Damn.

00:59:14.372 --> 00:59:16.750
- I thought this was the antigravity gun.
- What?

00:59:16.916 --> 00:59:18.001
No, that's that one.

00:59:31.473 --> 00:59:32.515
Here.

00:59:33.808 --> 00:59:37.687
Now you're the Shocker.
Go out there and find that weapon he lost.

00:59:37.854 --> 00:59:38.897
All right.

00:59:40.961 --> 00:59:42.241
Look at this!

00:59:43.001 --> 00:59:44.561
Where is the other
half of our ship?

00:59:44.721 --> 00:59:45.721
My ship.

00:59:45.881 --> 00:59:47.681
Either one of you
could have gotten us

00:59:47.761 --> 00:59:49.521
through that field...

00:59:49.681 --> 00:59:51.001
had you flown with
what's between your ears

00:59:51.041 --> 00:59:52.561
instead of what's
between your legs!

00:59:53.201 --> 00:59:56.041
If what's between my
legs had a hand on it...

00:59:56.201 --> 00:59:58.401
I guarantee I could have
landed this ship with it.

00:59:59.361 --> 01:00:01.201
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

01:00:01.241 --> 01:00:02.881
More like because he stole...

01:00:03.041 --> 01:00:04.241
the Anulax batteries!

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:06.561
They're called
Harbulary batteries.

01:00:06.761 --> 01:00:08.241
No, they're not!

01:00:08.601 --> 01:00:10.361
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch?
Hmm?

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.401
I'm not gonna answer
to "Star-Munch."

01:00:12.601 --> 01:00:14.441
I did it because I wanted to!

01:00:14.561 --> 01:00:15.561
Dick.

01:00:15.601 --> 01:00:17.401
What are we even
talking about this for?

01:00:17.561 --> 01:00:20.241
We just had a little man save
us by blowing up 50 ships!

01:00:20.281 --> 01:00:21.281
How little?

01:00:21.401 --> 01:00:23.481
Well, I don't know, like this?

01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:25.281
A little one-inch man saved us?

01:00:25.441 --> 01:00:27.761
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.

01:00:27.841 --> 01:00:30.121
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

01:00:30.281 --> 01:00:31.721
Don't call me a raccoon!

01:00:32.081 --> 01:00:34.521
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

01:00:35.361 --> 01:00:36.681
I meant trash panda.

01:00:38.961 --> 01:00:40.241
Is that better?

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.401
I don't know.

01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:44.761
It's worse. It's so much worse.

01:00:44.921 --> 01:00:45.961
You son of a...

01:00:46.081 --> 01:00:47.081
Hey!

01:00:47.201 --> 01:00:48.681
- I've had it with you!
- No! Back up!

01:00:48.761 --> 01:00:50.561
Someone followed you
through the jump point.

01:00:52.601 --> 01:00:54.761
Set me free, you'll
need my help.

01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:56.081
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

01:00:56.161 --> 01:00:58.161
You are a fool if you deprive
yourself a hand in combat.

01:00:58.241 --> 01:00:59.521
You'll attack me the
moment I let you go.

01:00:59.601 --> 01:01:00.681
No, I won't.

01:01:00.761 --> 01:01:02.281
You'd think an evil supervillain

01:01:02.441 --> 01:01:03.921
would learn how to properly lie.

01:01:04.081 --> 01:01:06.241
I bet it's the one-inch man.

01:01:38.081 --> 01:01:41.881
After all these years,
I've found you.

01:01:42.601 --> 01:01:44.321
And who the hell are you?

01:01:45.121 --> 01:01:48.321
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

01:01:49.641 --> 01:01:51.721
My name is Ego...

01:01:53.161 --> 01:01:54.641
and I'm your dad, Peter.

01:02:20.208 --> 01:02:21.568
He'll never beat T'Challa.

01:02:21.768 --> 01:02:23.888
He should've just come
to the first challenge

01:02:23.968 --> 01:02:25.728
and gotten it over with.

01:02:31.728 --> 01:02:34.088
The king will now
have the strength

01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:36.928
of the Black Panther
stripped away.

01:03:08.928 --> 01:03:10.208
Where is Agent Ross?

01:03:10.368 --> 01:03:13.128
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

01:03:17.608 --> 01:03:19.528
This is your last chance.

01:03:21.528 --> 01:03:23.368
Throw down your weapons,

01:03:23.448 --> 01:03:26.088
and we can handle
this another way.

01:03:33.408 --> 01:03:37.368
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.

01:03:37.528 --> 01:03:41.248
I trained, I lied, I killed...

01:03:41.408 --> 01:03:43.128
just to get here.

01:03:43.928 --> 01:03:47.528
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...

01:03:49.408 --> 01:03:50.448
Iraq.

01:03:52.048 --> 01:03:53.928
I took life from my
own brothers and sisters

01:03:54.008 --> 01:03:55.168
right here on this continent.

01:03:57.888 --> 01:03:59.288
And all this death...

01:04:00.528 --> 01:04:02.888
just so I could kill you.

01:04:10.488 --> 01:04:13.688
Let the challenge begin.

01:04:52.328 --> 01:04:53.328
Yield!

01:05:15.088 --> 01:05:16.408
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

01:05:36.768 --> 01:05:37.768
Come on, get up.

01:05:39.128 --> 01:05:40.128
Come here.

01:05:43.848 --> 01:05:45.128
This is for my father.

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:47.888
Erik!

01:05:48.568 --> 01:05:50.288
Zuri, no. Stop!

01:05:50.648 --> 01:05:51.888
Zuri! Zuri, don't!

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:54.048
I am the cause of
your father's death.

01:05:54.208 --> 01:05:55.448
Not him.

01:05:56.008 --> 01:05:57.168
Take me.

01:05:58.528 --> 01:06:00.088
I'll take you both, Uncle James.

01:06:01.008 --> 01:06:02.608
No!

01:06:02.688 --> 01:06:05.128
No! No!

01:06:06.808 --> 01:06:07.848
Zuri, no!

01:06:09.208 --> 01:06:10.168
No!

01:06:10.568 --> 01:06:14.008
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!

01:06:14.528 --> 01:06:16.328
No! No!

01:06:19.528 --> 01:06:21.808
Is this your king? Huh?

01:06:24.088 --> 01:06:25.368
Is this your king?

01:06:31.728 --> 01:06:33.208
The Black Panther,

01:06:33.288 --> 01:06:35.088
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?

01:06:35.248 --> 01:06:36.768
Come on, Brother!

01:06:36.928 --> 01:06:38.248
Is there nothing
that can be done?

01:06:39.768 --> 01:06:41.768
Him?

01:06:42.848 --> 01:06:43.888
He's supposed to protect you?

01:06:56.448 --> 01:06:57.848
No. No!

01:07:05.368 --> 01:07:07.288
No!

01:07:10.448 --> 01:07:12.888
Nah. I'm your king.

01:07:13.048 --> 01:07:14.728
- No! No!
- We have to go now!

01:07:14.888 --> 01:07:16.968
Queen Mother, let's go!
