00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:22.399
<i>♪ My life, my love</i>

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:24.799
<i>♪ My lady is the sea ♪</i>

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:27.999
Peter...

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:31.119
this is the sea.

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:34.279
Oh...

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.959
Finally! Rocket?

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:40.839
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.279
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:45.639
<i>to slice open the
Bank of A'askavaria.</i>

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.759
Ego's unhinged.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.359
<i>I know. Get ready.</i>

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:49.879
Drop her, Kraglin.

00:01:38.508 --> 00:01:40.188
Hey, there, jackass!

00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:51.874
What is that thing?

00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:01.354
Out of the way,
dumber, smaller Groot!

00:02:06.074 --> 00:02:08.714
I told you something
didn't feel right.

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:11.314
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.

00:02:11.394 --> 00:02:13.074
Well, I came back, didn't I?

00:02:13.754 --> 00:02:15.114
Because there's
an unspoken thing.

00:02:15.194 --> 00:02:17.234
There is no unspoken thing.

00:02:17.394 --> 00:02:19.074
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

00:02:19.754 --> 00:02:21.274
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?

00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:22.634
We had it under control.

00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:25.234
We did not.
That is only an extension...

00:02:25.274 --> 00:02:27.434
of his true self.
He will be back soon.

00:02:27.594 --> 00:02:28.954
What's Smurfette doing here?

00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:30.954
Whatever I need to do
to get a damn ride home.

00:02:31.034 --> 00:02:32.394
She tried to murder me!

00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:34.234
I saved you, you stupid fox!

00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:35.874
He's not a fox.

00:02:36.034 --> 00:02:37.034
I am Groot.

00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:38.154
I'm not a raboon, either.

00:02:38.274 --> 00:02:39.274
I am Groot.

00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:40.914
"Raccoon." Whatever.

00:02:44.394 --> 00:02:45.794
How do we kill a Celestial?

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.274
There's a center to him.

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:49.594
His brain, his soul,
whatever it is...

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:50.954
Some sort of protective shell.

00:02:51.274 --> 00:02:52.314
It's in the caverns...

00:02:52.474 --> 00:02:53.594
below the surface.

00:02:56.154 --> 00:02:57.914
Yondu?

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:07.634
Thrusters are out.

00:03:08.114 --> 00:03:09.994
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.

00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:11.994
Otherwise, you'd have
delivered me to this maniac.

00:03:12.074 --> 00:03:13.274
You still reckon
that's the reason

00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:14.594
I kept you around, you idiot?

00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:16.114
That's what you told me,
you old doofus.

00:03:16.794 --> 00:03:18.954
Once I figured out what
happened to them other kids...

00:03:18.994 --> 00:03:20.714
I wasn't just gonna
hand you over.

00:03:20.794 --> 00:03:22.434
You said you were gonna eat me.

00:03:22.474 --> 00:03:23.994
That was being funny!

00:03:24.794 --> 00:03:25.994
Not to me!

00:03:26.154 --> 00:03:27.434
You people have issues.

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:29.354
Of course I have issues.

00:03:30.194 --> 00:03:33.034
That's my freakin' father!

00:03:33.194 --> 00:03:34.794
Thrusters are back up.

00:03:48.354 --> 00:03:50.554
- We should be going up!
- We can't!

00:03:50.714 --> 00:03:53.354
Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:54.634
We have to kill him.

00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:55.674
Rocket!

00:03:55.794 --> 00:03:56.794
Got it!

00:04:02.954 --> 00:04:05.554
Whoo-hoo!

00:04:10.674 --> 00:04:12.514
So, we're saving
the galaxy again?

00:04:12.674 --> 00:04:13.714
I guess.

00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:15.034
Awesome!

00:04:17.034 --> 00:04:19.314
We're really gonna be
able to jack up our prices...

00:04:19.354 --> 00:04:21.074
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

00:04:21.154 --> 00:04:23.714
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

00:04:23.874 --> 00:04:26.754
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:29.194
Of course, I care about the
planets, and the buildings...

00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:31.074
and all the animals
on the planets.

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:32.514
And the people.

00:04:32.674 --> 00:04:33.674
Meh.

00:04:34.234 --> 00:04:38.434
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

00:05:06.904 --> 00:05:08.698
<i>Asgardians...</i>

00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:11.450
some misguided soul...

00:05:12.243 --> 00:05:14.203
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.747
Tell us where it is...

00:05:16.914 --> 00:05:19.542
or there will be consequences.

00:05:23.462 --> 00:05:24.589
Bad ones.

00:05:27.758 --> 00:05:28.759
Well?

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.018
You.

00:06:13.095 --> 00:06:17.308
Well? Executioner?

00:06:22.271 --> 00:06:23.439
Wait!

00:06:23.523 --> 00:06:24.524
Wait!

00:06:27.151 --> 00:06:28.277
I know where the sword is.

00:07:11.195 --> 00:07:13.447
I never thought
I'd be back here.

00:07:17.034 --> 00:07:18.619
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

00:07:19.078 --> 00:07:20.538
I mean, not that it's not nice.

00:07:20.621 --> 00:07:22.081
It's just, it's on fire.

00:07:22.248 --> 00:07:23.416
Here, up here in the mountains.

00:07:23.708 --> 00:07:25.877
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.

00:07:26.085 --> 00:07:27.086
She's coming for them.

00:07:27.253 --> 00:07:28.254
Okay, drop me off at the palace

00:07:28.337 --> 00:07:30.506
- and I'll draw her away.
- And get yourself killed?

00:07:30.673 --> 00:07:32.425
The people trapped down
there are all that matters.

00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:33.926
While I'm dealing with
Hela, I need you two

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.219
to help get everyone off Asgard.

00:07:35.386 --> 00:07:37.180
How the hell are we
supposed to do that?

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.390
I have a man on the ground.

00:07:45.271 --> 00:07:46.272
Asgard.

00:07:49.692 --> 00:07:51.027
She's here.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.290
Now the ship has a gun.

00:08:04.457 --> 00:08:05.625
I'll take it from here.

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:09.587
I found this in the armory.

00:08:12.757 --> 00:08:13.966
Good luck.

00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:16.844
Your Majesty...

00:08:18.804 --> 00:08:19.931
don't die.

00:08:22.725 --> 00:08:24.519
You know what I mean.

00:09:05.138 --> 00:09:06.138
<i>Pilots...</i>

00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:07.658
release envoy units.

00:09:09.818 --> 00:09:11.778
<i>Our sensors detect the batteries</i>

00:09:11.938 --> 00:09:13.938
<i>are below the surface
of the planet.</i>

00:09:15.778 --> 00:09:16.778
Dive!

00:09:33.738 --> 00:09:35.258
Um... Captain?

00:09:35.978 --> 00:09:37.418
<i>Captain?</i>

00:09:42.338 --> 00:09:44.138
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

00:09:44.618 --> 00:09:46.298
He needs my genetic
connection to the light...

00:09:46.498 --> 00:09:48.618
to help destroy the universe.

00:09:48.778 --> 00:09:50.978
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

00:09:51.138 --> 00:09:52.338
So, could you?

00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:53.658
A little.

00:09:53.818 --> 00:09:54.978
I made a ball.

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:56.138
A ball?

00:09:56.338 --> 00:09:57.978
I thought as hard as I could.

00:09:58.138 --> 00:09:59.818
It was all that I
could come up with.

00:09:59.858 --> 00:10:01.178
You "thought"?

00:10:01.338 --> 00:10:03.338
You think when I
make this arrow fly...

00:10:03.498 --> 00:10:05.498
I use my head?

00:10:16.898 --> 00:10:18.178
Whoa.

00:10:27.018 --> 00:10:28.018
There.

00:10:28.178 --> 00:10:30.178
That's Ego's core.

00:10:32.538 --> 00:10:34.178
That ore is thick, Rocket.

00:10:34.378 --> 00:10:35.978
I got it covered.

00:10:42.378 --> 00:10:43.698
We must hurry.

00:10:43.858 --> 00:10:45.978
It will not take Ego
long to find us.

00:10:50.218 --> 00:10:51.378
Keep it steady.

00:10:57.898 --> 00:11:00.018
We drill into the center,
we kill him!

00:11:06.378 --> 00:11:07.738
<i>Captain?</i>

00:11:08.058 --> 00:11:09.138
What is it, Kraglin?

00:11:09.218 --> 00:11:11.258
<i>Hey, remember
that Ayesha chick?</i>

00:11:11.685 --> 00:11:13.565
- Yeah, why?
<i>- Uh...</i>

00:11:13.653 --> 00:11:14.898
Oh, hell!

00:12:30.097 --> 00:12:32.015
We must keep moving!

00:12:32.641 --> 00:12:34.434
Go to the Bifrost!

00:13:17.019 --> 00:13:18.395
Sister.

00:13:20.397 --> 00:13:22.190
You're still alive.

00:13:22.357 --> 00:13:24.234
I love what you've
done with the place.

00:13:24.318 --> 00:13:25.819
Redecorating, I see.

00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:28.071
It seems our father's solution

00:13:28.155 --> 00:13:30.824
to every problem
was to cover it up.

00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:33.994
Or to cast it out.

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:40.000
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.

00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:41.543
You see?

00:13:42.211 --> 00:13:44.338
You never knew him.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.548
Not at his best.

00:13:46.715 --> 00:13:49.593
Odin and I drowned
entire civilizations

00:13:49.676 --> 00:13:51.261
in blood and tears.

00:13:51.428 --> 00:13:54.348
Where do you think
all this gold came from?

00:13:54.514 --> 00:13:56.266
And then, one day...

00:13:56.433 --> 00:13:59.436
he decided to become
a benevolent king.

00:13:59.603 --> 00:14:02.231
To foster peace,
to protect life...

00:14:03.357 --> 00:14:04.942
to have you.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.778
I understand why you're angry.

00:14:07.945 --> 00:14:09.404
And you are my sister,
and technically

00:14:09.488 --> 00:14:11.865
have a claim to the throne.

00:14:12.032 --> 00:14:13.867
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.

00:14:14.034 --> 00:14:15.244
But it can't be you.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.316
You're just...

00:14:17.402 --> 00:14:19.081
...the worst.

00:14:20.541 --> 00:14:22.334
Okay, get up.

00:14:22.501 --> 00:14:24.545
You're in my seat.

00:14:25.504 --> 00:14:27.506
You know, Father once told me...

00:14:27.673 --> 00:14:30.217
that a wise king
never seeks out war.

00:14:30.384 --> 00:14:32.928
But must always be ready for it.

00:14:37.717 --> 00:14:39.437
Why aren't you
firing the lasers?

00:14:39.757 --> 00:14:41.477
They blew out the generator.

00:14:41.637 --> 00:14:44.437
I think I packed
a small detonator.

00:14:44.637 --> 00:14:46.277
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

00:14:46.317 --> 00:14:47.957
Well, we got these.

00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:50.637
Is that thing strong
enough to kill Ego?

00:14:50.797 --> 00:14:52.677
If it is, it'll cause
a chain reaction...

00:14:52.837 --> 00:14:54.477
throughout his entire
nervous system.

00:14:54.517 --> 00:14:55.517
Meaning what?

00:14:55.637 --> 00:14:57.357
The entire planet will explode.

00:14:57.437 --> 00:14:58.917
We'll have to get
out of here fast.

00:14:59.077 --> 00:15:00.597
I rigged a timer.

00:15:01.517 --> 00:15:02.757
Go!

00:15:16.797 --> 00:15:18.637
He's coming.

00:15:20.037 --> 00:15:21.837
Didn't you say you
could make him sleep?

00:15:22.197 --> 00:15:24.637
When he wants.
He's too powerful.

00:15:24.837 --> 00:15:26.197
I can't!

00:15:26.637 --> 00:15:28.477
You don't have to
believe in yourself...

00:15:29.197 --> 00:15:31.317
because I believe in you.

00:15:43.357 --> 00:15:44.357
Sleep!

00:15:51.997 --> 00:15:53.717
I never thought she'd
be able to do it...

00:15:53.797 --> 00:15:56.037
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

00:15:56.997 --> 00:16:00.037
I don't know how
long I can hold him.

00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:04.877
The metal's too thick.

00:16:05.037 --> 00:16:06.037
For the bomb to work,

00:16:06.077 --> 00:16:08.437
we'd actually need to
place it on Ego's core.

00:16:08.517 --> 00:16:10.877
And our fat butts ain't gonna
fit through those tiny holes.

00:16:11.597 --> 00:16:12.597
Well...

00:16:15.197 --> 00:16:17.037
That's a terrible idea.

00:16:17.197 --> 00:16:19.597
Which is the only kind
of idea we have left.

00:16:20.557 --> 00:16:21.997
Unbelievable.

00:16:22.157 --> 00:16:24.517
"Rocket, do this.
Rocket, do that."

00:16:25.997 --> 00:16:27.437
What a day.

00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:38.557
All right, first you flick
this switch, then this switch.

00:16:38.717 --> 00:16:39.957
That activates it.

00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:41.957
Then you push this button...

00:16:42.117 --> 00:16:45.197
which will give you five
minutes to get out of there.

00:16:45.357 --> 00:16:46.717
Now, whatever you do...

00:16:47.237 --> 00:16:49.717
don't push this button...

00:16:49.877 --> 00:16:51.917
because that will set
off the bomb immediately

00:16:51.957 --> 00:16:53.397
and we'll all be dead.

00:16:53.597 --> 00:16:56.037
Now, repeat back
what I just said.

00:16:56.197 --> 00:16:57.957
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:00.077
- I am Groot.
- That's right.

00:17:00.237 --> 00:17:01.477
- I am Groot.
- No!

00:17:01.797 --> 00:17:04.197
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

00:17:04.397 --> 00:17:05.397
Try again.

00:17:06.557 --> 00:17:07.717
Hmm...

00:17:08.397 --> 00:17:10.237
- I am Groot.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:17:10.397 --> 00:17:12.437
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

00:17:12.597 --> 00:17:13.597
I am Groot.

00:17:13.637 --> 00:17:15.597
No! That's exactly
what you just said!

00:17:15.637 --> 00:17:17.277
How is that even possible?

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:19.597
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

00:17:19.757 --> 00:17:20.957
Point to it.

00:17:21.117 --> 00:17:22.117
No!

00:17:22.397 --> 00:17:24.237
Hey, you're making him nervous!

00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:26.077
Shut up and get me some tape!

00:17:26.237 --> 00:17:27.677
Does anybody have
any tape out there?

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:29.437
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

00:17:29.677 --> 00:17:32.517
I don't have any tape.
Let me check.

00:17:32.717 --> 00:17:35.357
<i>Yo, Yondu... Ow!</i>

00:17:35.517 --> 00:17:37.677
<i>Do you have any tape?</i>

00:17:39.957 --> 00:17:42.997
<i>Gamora? Do you have any tape?</i>

00:17:43.157 --> 00:17:44.237
<i>Tape!</i>

00:17:44.437 --> 00:17:46.797
<i>Never mind. Ow!</i>

00:17:47.757 --> 00:17:50.317
<i>Drax, do you have any tape?</i>

00:17:50.397 --> 00:17:52.997
<i>Yes, Scotch tape would work.</i>

00:17:53.317 --> 00:17:55.317
<i>Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,</i>

00:17:55.357 --> 00:17:56.357
<i>if you don't have any?</i>

00:17:57.837 --> 00:17:59.117
Nobody has any tape!

00:17:59.157 --> 00:18:00.677
Not a single person has tape?

00:18:01.117 --> 00:18:02.117
Nope!

00:18:02.277 --> 00:18:03.437
Did you ask Nebula?

00:18:03.997 --> 00:18:04.997
Yes!

00:18:05.157 --> 00:18:06.357
Are you sure?

00:18:06.517 --> 00:18:07.837
I asked Yondu...

00:18:07.997 --> 00:18:09.157
and she was sitting next to him.

00:18:09.197 --> 00:18:10.197
I knew you were lying!

00:18:10.277 --> 00:18:12.437
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.

00:18:12.517 --> 00:18:15.037
If anybody's gonna
have tape, it's you!

00:18:15.117 --> 00:18:18.757
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

00:18:18.837 --> 00:18:21.317
You are wasting
a lot of time here!

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.250
Whee!

00:18:27.078 --> 00:18:29.078
We're all gonna die.

00:18:58.774 --> 00:19:00.233
Go back!

00:19:05.364 --> 00:19:06.698
Go!

00:19:41.608 --> 00:19:44.194
To be honest,
I expected more.

00:19:47.197 --> 00:19:48.490
Heimdall!

00:19:50.701 --> 00:19:52.452
The sword!

00:19:56.957 --> 00:19:58.500
Here's the difference
between us.

00:19:58.667 --> 00:20:00.252
I'm Odin's firstborn...

00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:02.838
the rightful heir,
the savior of Asgard.

00:20:03.005 --> 00:20:04.756
And you're nothing.

00:20:15.017 --> 00:20:17.894
So simple, even a
blind man could see it.

00:20:19.896 --> 00:20:20.897
Oh.

00:20:21.606 --> 00:20:23.859
Now you remind me of Dad.

00:20:34.161 --> 00:20:35.912
The stupid dog won't die!

00:20:57.726 --> 00:21:00.729
Everything's gonna be
all right now. I got this.

00:21:00.937 --> 00:21:03.023
You wanted to know who I am?

00:21:03.982 --> 00:21:05.609
What the hell are
you talking about?

00:21:05.776 --> 00:21:07.194
You'll see!

00:21:55.867 --> 00:21:58.078
You see? No one's
going anywhere.

00:21:58.245 --> 00:21:59.621
I'll get that sword...

00:21:59.788 --> 00:22:02.499
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

00:22:28.942 --> 00:22:29.985
Hey, man.

00:22:31.695 --> 00:22:33.113
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.406
We're gonna jump
on that spaceship

00:22:34.489 --> 00:22:35.741
and get out of here.
Wanna come?

00:22:45.459 --> 00:22:49.296
Your savior is here.

00:22:56.511 --> 00:22:58.388
Did you miss me?

00:22:58.555 --> 00:23:00.015
Everyone, on that ship now.

00:23:04.394 --> 00:23:06.563
Welcome home.
I saw you coming.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:07.814
Of course you did.

00:23:24.498 --> 00:23:26.792
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.

00:23:27.834 --> 00:23:28.877
You see...

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.589
I'm not a queen or a monster.

00:23:34.299 --> 00:23:36.385
I'm the Goddess of Death.

00:23:37.177 --> 00:23:39.554
What were you the god of, again?

00:23:50.983 --> 00:23:52.859
Even when you had two eyes...

00:23:53.568 --> 00:23:55.445
you'd see only half the picture.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.033
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.

00:24:01.118 --> 00:24:04.663
Are you Thor,
the God of Hammers? Hmm?

00:24:07.708 --> 00:24:10.043
That hammer was to help
you control your power,

00:24:10.127 --> 00:24:11.420
to focus it.

00:24:12.212 --> 00:24:14.006
It was never your
source of strength.

00:24:14.715 --> 00:24:17.050
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.

00:24:18.093 --> 00:24:20.762
Asgard is not a place.
Never was.

00:24:22.014 --> 00:24:23.307
This could be Asgard.

00:24:24.474 --> 00:24:26.560
Asgard is where
our people stand.

00:24:27.561 --> 00:24:32.357
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.

00:24:40.073 --> 00:24:42.200
I'm not as strong as you.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:45.912
No...

00:24:47.331 --> 00:24:48.623
you're stronger.

00:24:57.632 --> 00:24:59.009
Tell me, brother.

00:24:59.176 --> 00:25:01.637
What were you the god of again?

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.441
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.

00:27:19.608 --> 00:27:21.109
This isn't over.

00:27:27.402 --> 00:27:29.562
Rear thrusters are out again!

00:27:29.722 --> 00:27:31.722
We're done for
without that generator!

00:27:45.722 --> 00:27:47.042
<i>Guardians...</i>

00:27:47.802 --> 00:27:49.442
<i>perhaps it will
provide you solace...</i>

00:27:49.602 --> 00:27:52.282
<i>that your deaths are
not without purpose.</i>

00:27:52.802 --> 00:27:54.442
<i>They will serve as a warning...</i>

00:27:54.602 --> 00:27:56.922
to all of those tempted
with betraying us.

00:27:57.402 --> 00:28:00.242
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

00:28:03.962 --> 00:28:05.122
This is gonna hurt.

00:28:05.242 --> 00:28:06.882
Promises, promises.

00:28:17.082 --> 00:28:18.042
Hey!

00:28:29.842 --> 00:28:30.842
No!

00:28:31.442 --> 00:28:33.562
No! No! No!

00:28:39.002 --> 00:28:40.002
<i>We're gonna blow!</i>

00:28:45.282 --> 00:28:47.322
Peter! No!

00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:08.162
What?

00:29:08.482 --> 00:29:10.482
You look like Mary Poppins.

00:29:10.642 --> 00:29:12.042
Is he cool?

00:29:13.842 --> 00:29:15.522
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

00:29:16.202 --> 00:29:18.162
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

00:29:45.522 --> 00:29:47.562
Mantis, look out!

00:29:59.682 --> 00:30:01.322
She's just unconscious.

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:18.882
How long until
the bomb goes off?

00:30:19.002 --> 00:30:21.442
In the unlikely event that
Groot doesn't kill us all...

00:30:21.522 --> 00:30:22.722
about six minutes.

00:30:27.722 --> 00:30:30.322
Kraglin, we need the
quadrant for an extraction.

00:30:30.402 --> 00:30:31.482
<i>T-minus five minutes.</i>

00:30:31.562 --> 00:30:32.722
Aye, Captain.

00:30:36.562 --> 00:30:38.522
Somebody's gotta be up
top when Kraglin arrives.

00:30:39.762 --> 00:30:41.282
Drax, take Mantis.

00:30:44.122 --> 00:30:45.562
Ow! My nipples!

00:30:53.642 --> 00:30:54.962
Gamora!

00:30:58.602 --> 00:30:59.762
Peter!

00:31:25.962 --> 00:31:27.402
Get over it.

00:31:27.802 --> 00:31:31.642
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:38.122
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

00:32:07.642 --> 00:32:09.642
Yeah!

00:32:09.682 --> 00:32:13.322
Soon, Peter, we
will be all there is.

00:32:14.002 --> 00:32:17.162
So stop pissing me off!

00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:38.922
We have to get up
to the extraction point!

00:32:47.042 --> 00:32:48.362
Go!

00:34:47.482 --> 00:34:49.042
I told you...

00:34:49.202 --> 00:34:53.162
I don't want to do this alone.

00:34:56.322 --> 00:34:57.362
You cannot deny...

00:34:57.522 --> 00:35:01.842
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

00:35:10.962 --> 00:35:12.722
Everyone, I need
you to stay back!

00:35:12.962 --> 00:35:13.962
What is that?

00:35:29.642 --> 00:35:31.922
<i>It doesn't need to
be like this, Peter.</i>

00:35:33.666 --> 00:35:36.746
Why are you
destroying our chance?

00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:42.882
<i>Stop pretending you
aren't what you are.</i>

00:35:44.762 --> 00:35:45.762
<i>One in billions.</i>

00:35:47.522 --> 00:35:49.362
<i>Trillions. Even more.</i>

00:35:51.682 --> 00:35:56.282
What greater meaning can
life possibly have to offer?

00:35:58.722 --> 00:36:02.922
I don't use my head
to fly the arrow, boy!

00:36:03.402 --> 00:36:05.242
I use my heart...

00:36:40.522 --> 00:36:44.282
You shouldn't have killed my
mom, and squished my Walkman.

00:37:28.952 --> 00:37:30.079
Hit her with a lightning blast.

00:37:30.245 --> 00:37:31.330
I just hit her with the
biggest lightning blast

00:37:31.413 --> 00:37:32.539
in the history of lightning.

00:37:32.706 --> 00:37:33.707
It did nothing.

00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:40.339
We just need to hold her

00:37:40.506 --> 00:37:42.424
It won't end there.

00:37:42.591 --> 00:37:46.011
The longer Hela's on Asgard,

She'll hunt us down.

00:37:48.055 --> 00:37:49.598
We need to stop
her here and now.

00:37:49.765 --> 00:37:50.974

00:38:14.123 --> 00:38:16.166
This was about causing Ragnarok.

You want Asgard, it's yours.

00:41:20.726 --> 00:41:24.146
Whatever game you're
playing, it won't work.

00:41:24.313 --> 00:41:25.981
You can't defeat me.

00:41:26.607 --> 00:41:27.941
No, I know.

00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:30.694
But he can.

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:36.366
No.

00:41:44.958 --> 00:41:48.378
Tremble before me, Asgard!

00:41:48.545 --> 00:41:50.672
I am your reckoning!

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:00.933
The people are safe.

00:42:01.558 --> 00:42:03.435
That's all that matters.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.605
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

00:42:07.106 --> 00:42:08.482
I hate this prophecy.

00:42:08.649 --> 00:42:10.442
So do I, but we have no choice.

00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:12.403
Surtur destroys Asgard...

00:42:12.569 --> 00:42:14.905
he destroys Hela, so that
our people may live.

00:42:15.072 --> 00:42:16.657
But we need to let
him finish the job,

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.825
otherwise...

00:42:19.493 --> 00:42:20.494
No!

00:42:22.913 --> 00:42:24.957
Hulk, stop, you moron!

00:42:34.049 --> 00:42:35.092
Hulk, stop.

00:42:35.259 --> 00:42:38.303
Just for once in
your life, don't smash.

00:42:39.471 --> 00:42:41.181
Big monster!

00:42:41.348 --> 00:42:42.808
Let's go!

00:42:44.476 --> 00:42:45.477
Fine.

00:43:09.668 --> 00:43:12.546
I am Asgard's doom!

00:43:35.527 --> 00:43:37.613
The damage is not too bad.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.782
As long as the foundations
are still strong...

00:43:39.948 --> 00:43:41.575
we can rebuild this place.

00:43:41.742 --> 00:43:43.952
It will become a haven...

00:43:44.119 --> 00:43:47.081
for all peoples and
aliens of the universe.

00:43:53.587 --> 00:43:56.632
Now those foundations
are gone. Sorry.

00:44:11.438 --> 00:44:13.357
What have I done?

00:44:14.525 --> 00:44:16.944
You saved us from extinction.

00:44:17.111 --> 00:44:18.946
Asgard is not a place...

00:44:20.447 --> 00:44:22.324
it's a people.

00:44:24.788 --> 00:44:25.751
<i>Groot!</i>

00:44:25.868 --> 00:44:27.668
If you can hear me, hurry up!

00:44:27.708 --> 00:44:30.988
I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!

00:44:31.388 --> 00:44:32.988
<i>Groot, hurry!</i>

00:45:28.748 --> 00:45:30.948
Yondu, we're about to blow!

00:45:31.108 --> 00:45:32.628
Get to the ship!

00:45:32.788 --> 00:45:33.828
Not without Quill!

00:45:33.948 --> 00:45:36.108
You need to take
care of the twig!

00:45:37.388 --> 00:45:39.188
Not without you!

00:45:40.348 --> 00:45:43.628
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

00:45:47.028 --> 00:45:49.268
You need to give me this.

00:45:57.388 --> 00:45:58.388
Uh...

00:45:59.468 --> 00:46:01.988
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

00:46:02.148 --> 00:46:04.308
I only have one of each.

00:46:16.588 --> 00:46:18.228
I am Groot.

00:46:18.988 --> 00:46:20.068
What's that?

00:46:21.668 --> 00:46:25.908
He says, "Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

00:46:26.508 --> 00:46:28.828
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

00:46:35.148 --> 00:46:36.188
Bye, twig.

00:46:38.148 --> 00:46:41.748
We're gonna need to have a real
discussion about your language.

00:47:36.388 --> 00:47:37.388
Where's Peter?

00:47:38.108 --> 00:47:40.108
Rocket, where is he?

00:47:40.908 --> 00:47:41.908
Rocket.

00:47:42.028 --> 00:47:43.588
Rocket, look at me!
Where is he?

00:47:46.188 --> 00:47:47.188
Mmm...

00:47:49.948 --> 00:47:52.388
No. I'm not leaving without him.

00:47:59.308 --> 00:48:00.308
I'm sorry.

00:48:01.148 --> 00:48:03.988
I can only afford to
lose one friend today.

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:05.548
Kraglin, go!

00:48:06.388 --> 00:48:07.388
Wait...

00:48:08.108 --> 00:48:09.708
Is Quill back?

00:48:11.228 --> 00:48:13.788
Rocket, where's Quill?

00:48:14.788 --> 00:48:18.228
Rocket, where's Quill?

00:48:19.228 --> 00:48:20.428
<i>Rocket!</i>

00:48:21.388 --> 00:48:22.508
<i>Where's Quill?</i>

00:48:24.588 --> 00:48:26.588
<i>Where's Quill?</i>

00:48:34.788 --> 00:48:36.988
No, we need to stop it.

00:48:42.188 --> 00:48:43.188
Stop.

00:48:43.988 --> 00:48:45.628
Stop. Listen to me!

00:48:45.788 --> 00:48:47.348
You are a god.

00:48:48.828 --> 00:48:50.148
If you kill me...

00:48:50.308 --> 00:48:52.948
you'll be just like
everybody else.

00:48:53.988 --> 00:48:55.628
What's so wrong with that?

00:48:55.788 --> 00:48:56.788
No!

00:49:47.388 --> 00:49:49.548
He may have been
your father, boy,

00:49:49.668 --> 00:49:51.148
but he wasn't your daddy.

00:49:55.508 --> 00:49:57.828
I'm sorry I didn't
do none of it right.

00:49:58.868 --> 00:50:01.228
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

00:50:04.988 --> 00:50:06.268
What?

00:50:18.068 --> 00:50:19.308
Yondu, what are you doing?

00:50:19.388 --> 00:50:20.588
You can't.

00:50:21.188 --> 00:50:22.948
Yondu!

00:50:28.588 --> 00:50:30.188
No!

00:50:34.668 --> 00:50:35.668
No!

00:50:36.748 --> 00:50:38.708
Oh! Aww...

00:50:39.028 --> 00:50:41.588
No! No!

00:50:42.268 --> 00:50:44.228
Oh, no!

00:51:43.052 --> 00:51:44.554
It suits you.

00:51:47.307 --> 00:51:50.059
Maybe you're not so
bad after all, brother.

00:51:50.518 --> 00:51:51.561
Maybe not.

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:53.938
Thank you.

00:51:54.689 --> 00:51:57.191
If you were here, I might
even give you a hug.

00:52:01.279 --> 00:52:02.530
I'm here.

00:52:26.804 --> 00:52:28.848
Your throne.

00:52:43.237 --> 00:52:46.574
So. King of Asgard.

00:52:57.085 --> 00:52:58.211
Where to?

00:52:59.337 --> 00:53:00.755
I'm not sure.

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:02.632
Any suggestions?

00:53:05.051 --> 00:53:07.011
Miek, where are you from?

00:53:07.178 --> 00:53:09.013
Oh, Miek's dead.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.308
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped
on him on the bridge.

00:53:12.475 --> 00:53:13.977
I've just felt so guilty,

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.395
I've been carrying
him around all day.

00:53:17.313 --> 00:53:19.148
Miek, you're alive!

00:53:19.315 --> 00:53:20.483
He's alive, guys.

00:53:20.566 --> 00:53:21.943
What was your
question again, bro?

00:53:23.444 --> 00:53:24.862
Earth it is.

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:35.091
Do you really think
it's a good idea

00:53:35.175 --> 00:53:36.301
to go back to Earth?

00:53:36.468 --> 00:53:37.552
Yes, of course.

00:53:37.636 --> 00:53:39.763
The people of Earth love me.
I'm very popular.

00:53:40.347 --> 00:53:42.265
Let me rephrase that.

00:53:42.432 --> 00:53:44.225
Do you really think
it's a good idea

00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:46.019
to bring me back to Earth?

00:53:46.186 --> 00:53:48.229
Probably not, to be honest.

00:53:48.396 --> 00:53:50.106
I wouldn't worry, brother.

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.318
I feel like everything's
gonna work out fine.

00:54:37.678 --> 00:54:39.238
I told Gamora...

00:54:39.358 --> 00:54:41.238
how when I was a
kid I used to pretend

00:54:41.358 --> 00:54:43.158
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

00:54:45.503 --> 00:54:48.678
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.

00:54:50.198 --> 00:54:52.078
Earlier, it struck me...

00:54:53.318 --> 00:54:55.318
Yondu didn't have a talking car,

00:54:55.438 --> 00:54:57.438
but he did have a flying arrow.

00:54:58.038 --> 00:55:00.278
He didn't have the beautiful
voice of an angel...

00:55:00.358 --> 00:55:02.638
but he did have
the whistle of one.

00:55:02.798 --> 00:55:06.358
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

00:55:06.438 --> 00:55:08.998
and hooked up with hot women...

00:55:09.158 --> 00:55:11.158
and fought robots.

00:55:13.838 --> 00:55:17.838
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind
of end up being my dad after all.

00:55:17.998 --> 00:55:19.198
Only it was you, Yondu.

00:55:25.718 --> 00:55:27.638
I had a pretty cool dad.

00:55:30.638 --> 00:55:33.358
What I'm trying
to say here is...

00:55:34.318 --> 00:55:38.958
sometimes that thing you're
searching for your whole life...

00:55:41.318 --> 00:55:43.678
it's right there by
your side all along.

00:55:43.838 --> 00:55:45.638
You don't even know it.

00:55:57.758 --> 00:55:59.158
I am Groot.

00:56:00.598 --> 00:56:02.318
He did call you twig.

00:56:04.758 --> 00:56:06.078
Nebula...

00:56:11.038 --> 00:56:12.998
I was a child like you.

00:56:13.878 --> 00:56:17.998
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

00:56:18.198 --> 00:56:21.158
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

00:56:21.318 --> 00:56:23.118
I'm trying to make it right.

00:56:23.278 --> 00:56:24.758
There are little
girls like you...

00:56:24.798 --> 00:56:27.638
across the universe
who are in danger.

00:56:30.318 --> 00:56:31.918
You can stay with
us and help them.

00:56:32.478 --> 00:56:34.878
I will help them
by killing Thanos.

00:56:35.038 --> 00:56:37.078
I don't know if that's possible.

00:56:51.958 --> 00:56:54.078
You will always be my sister.

00:57:38.278 --> 00:57:39.278
Pete!

00:57:43.078 --> 00:57:44.958
Captain found this for
you in a junker shop.

00:57:45.038 --> 00:57:47.838
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.

00:57:49.638 --> 00:57:50.798
What is it?

00:57:50.878 --> 00:57:51.918
It's called a Zune.

00:57:51.998 --> 00:57:54.118
It's what everybody's
listening to on Earth nowadays.

00:57:54.198 --> 00:57:55.598
It's got 300 songs on it.

00:57:55.678 --> 00:57:57.998
300 songs?

00:58:03.078 --> 00:58:04.238
Wait.

00:58:10.318 --> 00:58:12.238
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

00:58:12.318 --> 00:58:14.758
I think Yondu would
want you to have it.

00:58:18.238 --> 00:58:19.558
Thanks...

00:58:21.398 --> 00:58:22.678
Captain.

00:59:44.078 --> 00:59:45.518
What is it?

00:59:46.198 --> 00:59:48.758
I sent word to Yondu's
old Ravager buddies,

00:59:48.798 --> 00:59:50.318
and told them what he did.

00:59:53.958 --> 00:59:55.758
It's a Ravager funeral.

01:00:13.078 --> 01:00:14.078
Yeah!

01:00:14.758 --> 01:00:16.198
Yeah!

01:00:23.558 --> 01:00:25.478
He didn't let us down
after all, Captain.

01:00:26.398 --> 01:00:28.198
No, he did not, son.

01:00:29.198 --> 01:00:30.638
He did not.

01:00:37.318 --> 01:00:40.718
Fare thee well, old friend.

01:00:42.918 --> 01:00:47.758
Yondu Udonta, I will
see you in the stars.

01:00:51.838 --> 01:00:53.798
He didn't chase them away.

01:00:53.958 --> 01:00:55.038
No.

01:00:56.078 --> 01:00:58.198
Even though he yelled at them.

01:00:58.398 --> 01:00:59.958
And was always mean.

01:01:02.478 --> 01:01:04.598
And he stole batteries
he didn't need.

01:01:10.238 --> 01:01:11.758
Well, of course not.

01:01:35.998 --> 01:01:37.158
What?

01:01:37.838 --> 01:01:38.958
It's just...

01:01:41.638 --> 01:01:44.358
some unspoken thing.

01:01:53.438 --> 01:01:55.518
It's beautiful.

01:01:57.038 --> 01:01:58.198
It is.

01:01:59.718 --> 01:02:01.918
And so are you.

01:02:03.838 --> 01:02:05.078
On the inside.

destiny arrives all the same.

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:02.479
And now, it's here.

01:03:03.063 --> 01:03:04.898
Or should I say...

01:03:06.233 --> 01:03:07.776
I am.

01:04:00.869 --> 01:04:02.829
High Priestess, the
Council is waiting.

01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:07.189
They are perturbed I've
wasted our resources.

01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:14.749
When they see what
I have created here...

01:04:14.949 --> 01:04:16.989
their wrath will dissipate.

01:04:18.189 --> 01:04:21.189
It's a new type of
birthing pod, ma'am?

01:04:22.009 --> 01:04:23.249
That, my child...

01:04:23.949 --> 01:04:25.909
is the next step
in our evolution.

01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:29.109
More powerful,
more beautiful...

01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:33.429
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

01:04:36.029 --> 01:04:38.589
I think I shall call him...

01:04:40.312 --> 01:04:41.421
Adam.
