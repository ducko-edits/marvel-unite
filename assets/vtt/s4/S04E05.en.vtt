WEBVTT

00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:23.250
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:25.377
Yeah, well, something came up.

00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:26.754
What is that?

00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:29.715
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:31.342
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:32.968
Awesome.

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:36.222
I mean, not awesome.
Heh, totally uncool of that guy.

00:00:36.388 --> 00:00:38.182
So scary.

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:41.185
Well, look, I think it's...

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:42.811
...a power source.

00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:45.564
Yeah, but it's connected to
all these microprocessors.

00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:48.943
That's an inductive charging plate.
That's what I use to charge my toothbrush.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.154
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:56.200
That is literally the coolest
sentence anyone has ever said.

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:59.411
I just want to thank you for
letting me be part of your journey...

00:00:59.578 --> 00:01:01.956
...into this amazing--

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:07.586
Keep your fingers
clear of the blades.

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:11.840
I gotta figure out what
this is and who makes it.

00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:14.218
We'll go to the lab
after class and run tests.

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:15.678
Let's do it.

00:01:23.143 --> 00:01:25.437
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.

00:01:25.604 --> 00:01:28.065
We gotta come up with a
better name than "glowy thingy."

00:01:28.232 --> 00:01:29.316
You're right.

00:01:30.818 --> 00:01:31.944
Crap.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.780
Come on, come on, come on.

00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:40.244
High schools creep me out.

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:42.913
They got this funny
smell, you know?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.374
Hey, that's one of the
guys that tried to kill me.

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:46.584
What?

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.252
- Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:50.296
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.

00:01:50.462 --> 00:01:53.048
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.

00:01:53.215 --> 00:01:55.467
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:58.888
- Peter--
- No. Stay there, Ned.

00:01:59.054 --> 00:02:00.639
Peter.

00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:04.935
What are you doing?

00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:06.270
Nothing. Heh.

00:02:06.437 --> 00:02:08.689
- Oh.
- Yeah. You good?

00:02:08.856 --> 00:02:09.899
Chess.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.280
Can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?

00:02:16.447 --> 00:02:18.532
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.159
There's no sign of the weapon.

00:02:20.326 --> 00:02:23.245
- And even if it was here, now it's gone.
- So are we.

00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:58.781
This is so awesome.

00:02:58.948 --> 00:03:00.783
I know, right?

00:03:03.994 --> 00:03:05.788
They're in Brooklyn.

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.919
Staten Island.

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:19.552
Leaving Jersey.

00:03:27.142 --> 00:03:28.769
They stopped.

00:03:29.478 --> 00:03:30.896
Huh.

00:03:31.522 --> 00:03:32.606
Maryland?

00:03:32.773 --> 00:03:35.025
- What's there?
- I don't know.

00:03:35.192 --> 00:03:36.235
Evil lair? Heh.

00:03:36.777 --> 00:03:38.821
- They have a lair?
- A gang with alien guns...

00:03:38.988 --> 00:03:40.781
...run by a guy with wings?
Yeah.

00:03:40.948 --> 00:03:42.366
Badass.

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:45.411
But how are you gonna get
there if it's, like, 300 miles away?

00:03:47.663 --> 00:03:50.249
It's not too far from D.C.

00:04:20.764 --> 00:04:21.890
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.

00:04:22.057 --> 00:04:23.100
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:25.144
I was hoping I could
rejoin the team.

00:04:25.311 --> 00:04:26.937
No, no way.
You can't quit on us...

00:04:27.104 --> 00:04:29.732
...stroll up and be
welcomed back by everyone.

00:04:29.898 --> 00:04:32.776
Hey, welcome back, Peter!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.

00:04:32.943 --> 00:04:34.278
- What?
- He's taking your place.

00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:35.821
Excuse me, can we go already?

00:04:35.988 --> 00:04:39.783
I was hoping to get in some protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.411
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.

00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:47.958
<i>Focus up, everyone.
Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.</i>

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:49.752
The second law
of thermodynamics.

00:04:50.294 --> 00:04:52.212
- Frank Sinatra.
- Fort Sumter.

00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:55.215
- Flash is wrong.
- Okay, let's focus. Next one.

00:04:55.382 --> 00:04:56.717
Liz, don't overwork them.

00:04:57.217 --> 00:04:58.927
Uh, strontium,
barium, vibranium.

00:04:59.094 --> 00:05:01.805
- Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.
- Glad to be back.

00:05:03.432 --> 00:05:06.435
- What is the current standard unit of--?
- Can I take this real quick?

00:05:06.602 --> 00:05:08.103
Yeah, fine.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.064
- Hello?
- Got a blip on my screen here.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.273
You left New York?

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.275
- Okay, focus up, everyone.
- Tracker. Uh....

00:05:13.442 --> 00:05:15.361
Yeah, it's just a school trip.
It's, uh, nothing.

00:05:15.527 --> 00:05:17.946
Happy, I gotta say, tracking
me without permission...

00:05:18.113 --> 00:05:19.907
...is a complete
violation of privacy.

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.409
- That's different.
- What's different?

00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:25.037
Nothing.
Look, it's just the Academic Decathlon.

00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:28.290
<i>- It's no big deal.</i>
- Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:33.045
Sounds like no big deal, but
remember, I'm watching you.

00:05:40.347 --> 00:05:42.224
You know, this is the
first piece of clothing

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:43.809
I've ever bought for myself.

00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:47.188
That?

00:05:47.772 --> 00:05:48.773
Yeah. You don't like it?

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:50.483
Is that like a...

00:05:51.525 --> 00:05:52.568
Is it army surplus, or...

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:54.195
Okay, it has a lot of pockets.

00:05:54.612 --> 00:05:56.906
But I use them all the time,

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:59.283
and I made some of
my own modifications.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.077
- Oh, yeah?
- Whatever.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.454
Shut up.
The point is, I've never...

00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.916
I've never had control over
my own life before, and now I do.

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:08.751
I want to do things.

00:06:09.627 --> 00:06:10.711
Hmm...

00:06:11.128 --> 00:06:12.171
I like your vest.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:15.049
I knew it. I knew you did.
It's so cool, right?

00:06:15.216 --> 00:06:16.342
It's good. Yes. I like it.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.887
And you can put so much stuff in there.
You wouldn't even know.

00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:26.018
I really don't know where
the Red Room is, though.

00:06:26.102 --> 00:06:28.187
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:31.190
But I think I know
somebody who does.

00:06:31.357 --> 00:06:32.358
Oh, yeah? Who?

00:06:33.067 --> 00:06:34.693
We're gonna need a jet.

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:37.822
I said we needed a jet.

00:06:38.697 --> 00:06:40.741
Yeah, you know what
you didn't give me? Time.

00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:42.493
Or money. I'm not made of jets.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.161
I thought you were
supposed to be the best.

00:06:44.245 --> 00:06:45.246
Like a real pro.

00:06:45.413 --> 00:06:46.622
Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina.

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.582
Was the free flat and
lifetime supply of kissel

00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:50.334
- not to your liking?
- Ha!

00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:52.086
Don't let her wind you up.

00:06:52.253 --> 00:06:54.672
No, I take exception to
impugning my professionalism.

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:58.676
Well, you did set me up with a
generator that crapped out after six hours.

00:06:58.843 --> 00:07:01.095
You, too, huh? Tag team.

00:07:01.262 --> 00:07:04.348
Aw, he's sensitive.
See why you keep him around.

00:07:04.515 --> 00:07:05.975
Where's the rest?

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:13.816
Voilà.

00:07:14.442 --> 00:07:15.651
Ooh.

00:07:16.777 --> 00:07:18.362
Oh, I stashed that,
like, five years ago.

00:07:20.448 --> 00:07:21.699
How is it?

00:07:22.324 --> 00:07:25.077
It's dry. It's really dry.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.187
You know, you're getting dangerously
close to running out your tab.

00:07:33.522 --> 00:07:36.316
Supplies I can tally, but you bring
me attention from the authorities,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.027
all my prices go up.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.155
What's that supposed to mean?

00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:44.366
Your mate, Secretary Ross,
has been sniffing around my affairs

00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:47.494
to the point at which I've got
contacts declining my calls.

00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:49.580
I'm a private contractor.

00:07:50.998 --> 00:07:52.583
You are sensitive.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.293
You're a very
annoying individual.

00:07:56.795 --> 00:07:58.422
- I'll make it up to you.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:07:59.548 --> 00:08:01.341
That's what you say every time.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.660
I hired Yondu to pick you up...

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.860
when your mother passed away.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.860
But instead of returning you...

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.780
Yondu kept you.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.660
I have no clue as to why.

00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:17.843
Well, I'll tell you why.

00:08:18.003 --> 00:08:19.403
Because I was
a skinny little kid

00:08:19.483 --> 00:08:21.123
who could squeeze into
places adults couldn't.

00:08:21.203 --> 00:08:22.683
It made it easier for thievin'.

00:08:22.843 --> 00:08:26.123
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.

00:08:26.675 --> 00:08:28.243
I thought Yondu was your father.

00:08:28.443 --> 00:08:30.603
What? We've been together
this whole time...

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:33.443
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

00:08:33.603 --> 00:08:34.923
You look exactly alike.

00:08:35.003 --> 00:08:36.643
One's blue!

00:08:38.283 --> 00:08:40.043
No, he's not my father!

00:08:40.123 --> 00:08:42.563
Yondu was the guy
who abducted me...

00:08:42.723 --> 00:08:44.603
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

00:08:44.683 --> 00:08:46.723
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.

00:08:46.923 --> 00:08:48.283
Eat you? Yeah.

00:08:48.363 --> 00:08:50.443
Oh, that son of a bitch.

00:08:50.603 --> 00:08:52.043
How'd you locate us now?

00:08:52.763 --> 00:08:55.843
Well, even where I reside, out
past the edge of what's known...

00:08:55.923 --> 00:08:58.443
we've heard tell about
the man they call Star-Lord.

00:08:58.603 --> 00:09:00.843
What say we head
out there right now?

00:09:01.003 --> 00:09:02.003
Your associates are welcome.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.283
Even that triangle-faced
monkey there.

00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:05.763
I promise you...

00:09:06.283 --> 00:09:08.283
it's unlike any other
place you've ever seen.

00:09:09.043 --> 00:09:10.203
And there...

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:14.483
I can explain your
very special heritage.

00:09:15.683 --> 00:09:17.523
Finally get to be...

00:09:17.683 --> 00:09:20.403
the father I've
always wanted to be.

00:09:21.843 --> 00:09:23.363
Excuse me.

00:09:23.843 --> 00:09:25.243
I've gotta take a whiz.

00:09:31.403 --> 00:09:33.243
I'm not buying it.

00:09:35.363 --> 00:09:37.043
Let's go take a walk.

00:09:43.763 --> 00:09:45.283
I am Mantis.

00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:50.563
What are you doing?

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:52.123
Smiling.

00:09:52.963 --> 00:09:55.523
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

00:09:56.523 --> 00:09:58.603
Not if you do it like that.

00:09:58.763 --> 00:09:59.843
Oh...

00:10:00.243 --> 00:10:02.843
I was raised alone
on Ego's planet.

00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:07.763
I do not understand the
intricacies of social interaction.

00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:13.683
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.

00:10:16.523 --> 00:10:17.563
Yes.

00:10:26.843 --> 00:10:30.643
That is called a practical joke!

00:10:33.803 --> 00:10:35.883
I liked it very much!

00:10:36.043 --> 00:10:37.723
I just made it up!

00:10:40.603 --> 00:10:41.603
<i>Give me a break!</i>

00:10:42.403 --> 00:10:43.403
After all this time,

00:10:43.483 --> 00:10:44.883
you're gonna show
up, and all of a sudden...

00:10:44.963 --> 00:10:46.803
- you wanna be my dad?
- I hear you.

00:10:46.883 --> 00:10:49.083
And by the way,
this could be a trap.

00:10:49.123 --> 00:10:50.763
The Kree purists,
the Ravagers...

00:10:50.843 --> 00:10:52.603
they all want us dead.
I know, but...

00:10:52.683 --> 00:10:53.723
But what?

00:10:53.763 --> 00:10:56.363
What was that story you told
me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

00:10:56.403 --> 00:10:57.403
Who?

00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:58.843
He owned a magic boat?

00:11:00.763 --> 00:11:02.003
David Hasselhoff?

00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:03.083
Right.

00:11:03.203 --> 00:11:05.363
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

00:11:05.403 --> 00:11:06.443
Why did he talk again?

00:11:06.643 --> 00:11:10.083
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

00:11:10.243 --> 00:11:12.843
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

00:11:13.003 --> 00:11:14.803
and you would tell
all the other children...

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:17.083
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

00:11:17.163 --> 00:11:19.803
Shooting <i>Knight Rider</i> or
touring with his band in Germany.

00:11:19.883 --> 00:11:21.083
I told you that
when I was drunk.

00:11:21.123 --> 00:11:22.323
Why are you
bringing that up now?

00:11:22.403 --> 00:11:23.483
I love that story.

00:11:23.563 --> 00:11:25.603
I hate that story.

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.243
It's so sad!

00:11:27.963 --> 00:11:30.203
As a kid, I used to
see all the other kids

00:11:30.283 --> 00:11:32.403
off playing catch
with their dad.

00:11:32.563 --> 00:11:35.243
And I wanted that, more
than anything in the world!

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:37.643
That's my point, Peter.

00:11:38.483 --> 00:11:41.403
What if this man
is your Hasselhoff?

00:11:43.784 --> 00:11:46.323
Listen, if he ends
up being evil...

00:11:47.763 --> 00:11:49.363
we'll just kill him.

00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:58.923
You're leaving me with that fox?

00:11:59.083 --> 00:12:00.283
He's not a fox.

00:12:00.443 --> 00:12:02.283
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.

00:12:03.483 --> 00:12:04.643
Or if you feel like it.

00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:05.843
Okay.

00:12:07.003 --> 00:12:09.443
It'll be just a couple of days.

00:12:09.603 --> 00:12:12.403
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished fixing the ship.

00:12:15.643 --> 00:12:17.483
What if the Sovereign come?

00:12:17.643 --> 00:12:19.803
There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.

00:12:19.923 --> 00:12:21.483
I'm uncertain
about parting ways.

00:12:21.643 --> 00:12:23.243
God, you're like an old woman.

00:12:23.403 --> 00:12:25.123
Because I'm wise?

00:12:26.043 --> 00:12:28.003
Why do you have so much luggage?

00:12:28.163 --> 00:12:30.323
I don't want Groot
playing with my things.

00:12:33.403 --> 00:12:36.083
I hope Daddy isn't as big
of a dick as you, orphan boy.

00:12:38.043 --> 00:12:41.883
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?

00:12:42.683 --> 00:12:44.763
Because it's working.

00:12:47.247 --> 00:12:53.403

- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.

00:13:43.075 --> 00:13:44.910
You kidding me?
This place is huge.

00:13:45.077 --> 00:13:47.663
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:51.083
- Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
- Why?

00:13:59.132 --> 00:14:00.509
Peter...

00:14:00.676 --> 00:14:03.679
...why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?

00:14:04.054 --> 00:14:05.055
Uh...

00:14:05.222 --> 00:14:08.350
...I gotta follow these guys to
their boss before they move again...

00:14:08.517 --> 00:14:11.436
...and I don't really want
Mr. Stark to know about it.

00:14:11.603 --> 00:14:13.438
So you're lying to Iron Man now?

00:14:13.605 --> 00:14:15.232
No, I'm not lying.

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:18.026
He just doesn't really
get what I can do yet.

00:14:19.653 --> 00:14:21.071
Ah....

00:14:22.614 --> 00:14:24.116
Gotcha.

00:14:24.283 --> 00:14:28.453
All right, Happy,
enjoy tracking this lamp.

00:14:31.415 --> 00:14:33.834
There's a ton of other
subsystems in here...

00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:35.878
- Hmm?
- ...but they're all disabled...

00:14:36.044 --> 00:14:38.255
...by the Training
Wheels Protocol.

00:14:38.422 --> 00:14:39.548
What?

00:14:39.715 --> 00:14:43.343
"Training Wheels Protocol"?
Turn it off.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.430
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.

00:14:46.847 --> 00:14:49.182
Come on, man, I don't
need training wheels.

00:14:49.349 --> 00:14:51.727
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.

00:14:51.894 --> 00:14:54.188
- It's not cool.
- But you are a kid.

00:14:54.354 --> 00:14:56.440
A kid who can stop a
bus with his bare hands.

00:14:56.607 --> 00:15:00.360
Peter, I just don't think this is a great
idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?

00:15:00.527 --> 00:15:03.488
Look, please. This is my chance
to prove myself.

00:15:03.655 --> 00:15:05.407
I can handle it. Ned, come on.

00:15:05.574 --> 00:15:08.285
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- The guy in the chair.

00:15:08.744 --> 00:15:10.913
- Don't do that.
- Come on.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.929
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe.

00:15:27.095 --> 00:15:28.680
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.

00:15:30.307 --> 00:15:31.850
- They're moving.
- Be careful.

00:15:35.896 --> 00:15:37.606
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.

00:15:38.023 --> 00:15:39.149
We're gonna go swimming.

00:15:39.316 --> 00:15:40.984
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What?

00:15:41.652 --> 00:15:43.403
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.

00:15:45.072 --> 00:15:46.406
Hey.

00:15:47.032 --> 00:15:50.869
I was, uh-- I was gonna go
study in the business center.

00:15:51.036 --> 00:15:53.372
You don't need to study.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.

00:15:53.539 --> 00:15:54.831
And besides...

00:15:54.998 --> 00:15:58.794
...um, a rebellious group activity the
day before competition is good for morale.

00:15:58.961 --> 00:15:59.962
Hmm?

00:16:00.128 --> 00:16:02.339
Um, well, I read that
in a TED Talk, so--

00:16:02.506 --> 00:16:04.758
I-- I heard it in a TED Talk.

00:16:04.925 --> 00:16:06.843
And I read a coaching book.

00:16:07.928 --> 00:16:10.013
Wow, you really-- This
is really important to you.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.057
Yeah. It's our future.

00:16:12.224 --> 00:16:13.642
I'm not gonna screw it up.

00:16:14.685 --> 00:16:18.564
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.984
- So get your trunks on and come on.
- Come on.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.278
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

00:16:24.444 --> 00:16:25.487
Let's go.

00:16:49.386 --> 00:16:51.638
<i>- Good evening, Peter.</i>
- Hello? Hello?

00:16:51.805 --> 00:16:54.725
<i>Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...</i>

00:16:54.892 --> 00:16:57.436
<i>...and gaining access to
your suit's full capabilities.</i>

00:16:57.603 --> 00:16:59.188
Ah, thank you.

00:16:59.354 --> 00:17:01.190
<i>Where would you
like to take me tonight?</i>

00:17:01.356 --> 00:17:04.067
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.

00:17:04.234 --> 00:17:06.278
<i>Tracker located.</i>

00:17:06.737 --> 00:17:08.989
<i>Plotting course
to intercept target.</i>

00:17:09.156 --> 00:17:12.242
As long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.961
<i>One hundred meters from
destination and closing.</i>

00:17:23.337 --> 00:17:24.963
<i>Jump now.</i>

00:17:29.468 --> 00:17:31.470
<i>Detecting three individuals.</i>

00:17:32.221 --> 00:17:35.849
Why is their secret lair in a gas station?
That's so lame.

00:17:39.853 --> 00:17:41.605
Hey, suit lady,
what are they doing?

00:17:41.772 --> 00:17:43.065
<i>Do you want to hear
what they're saying?</i>

00:17:43.232 --> 00:17:45.692
I can hear what they're saying?
Uh, yeah.

00:17:45.859 --> 00:17:47.778
<i>Activating Enhanced
Reconnaissance Mode.</i>

00:17:47.945 --> 00:17:49.738
I got the gauntlet from
the Lagos cleanup.

00:17:49.905 --> 00:17:50.906
The rest is my design.

00:17:51.073 --> 00:17:52.366
Whoa, that's so cool.

00:17:52.533 --> 00:17:53.534
Can't believe they're
still cleaning up...

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.202
- ...that Triskelion mess.
- I love it.

00:17:55.369 --> 00:17:57.955
They keep making
messes, we keep getting rich.

00:17:58.121 --> 00:17:59.122
Target inbound.

00:17:59.289 --> 00:18:00.874
Whoa, they're in
the middle of a heist.

00:18:01.041 --> 00:18:03.210
I could catch them red-handed.
This is awesome.

00:18:03.377 --> 00:18:05.671
Okay, I'll get closer to
see what's happening.

00:18:05.837 --> 00:18:08.549
<i>Would you like me to engage
Enhanced Combat Mode?</i>

00:18:08.715 --> 00:18:11.051
Uh, "Enhanced Combat Mode"?
Yeah.

00:18:11.218 --> 00:18:12.678
<i>Activating Instant Kill.</i>

00:18:12.844 --> 00:18:14.930
No, no, no.
I don't want to kill anybody.

00:18:15.097 --> 00:18:17.391
<i>Deactivating Instant Kill.</i>

00:18:20.352 --> 00:18:22.104
Did you hear that?

00:18:22.521 --> 00:18:24.523
What the hell just happened?
What was that?

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.109
<i>You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.</i>

00:18:29.653 --> 00:18:30.946
What's wrong with
my web-shooters?

00:18:31.113 --> 00:18:33.448
<i>Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.</i>

00:18:33.615 --> 00:18:36.326
- Why would I need rapid-fire?
<i>- Would you like to see more options?</i>

00:18:36.493 --> 00:18:39.496
<i>You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.</i>

00:18:39.705 --> 00:18:41.373
Whoa, Mr. Stark
really overdid it.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.708
You two wait right here.

00:18:42.875 --> 00:18:45.002
Wait. You're gonna want to
turn on the dampers.

00:18:45.168 --> 00:18:48.463
- That thing will shatter your arm.
- All right, where's the dampers?

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.340
- That one.
<i>- Great choice.</i>

00:18:50.716 --> 00:18:53.093
<i>Would you like me to set
this as your new default?</i>

00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:55.637
No, no, no.

00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:58.348
- Push that in. No, the other--
- Here? This one here?

00:18:58.515 --> 00:19:00.851
- What was that?
- <i>Taser webs.</i>

00:19:01.018 --> 00:19:02.853
Taser webs?
I don't want Taser webs.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.522
<i>You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.</i>

00:19:06.023 --> 00:19:07.733
<i>Would you like to run
a refresher course?</i>

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.235
- No. Just-- You choose.
<i>- Sure thing.</i>

00:19:10.402 --> 00:19:13.071
<i>Six-alpha-niner, are
you running on time?</i>

00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:16.700
Copy, central.
Six-alpha-niner on schedule.

00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:21.371
- I got a visual.
- Green light, green light.

00:19:25.959 --> 00:19:27.252
Oh, that's him.

00:19:31.006 --> 00:19:33.050
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.

00:19:33.217 --> 00:19:34.635
Pulling in behind the caboose.

00:19:36.428 --> 00:19:38.222
<i>Deploy anchors.</i>

00:19:48.273 --> 00:19:49.608
Dropping down.

00:19:52.194 --> 00:19:54.112
No outgoing distress signals.
You're clear.

00:19:56.073 --> 00:19:59.368
Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.

00:20:06.917 --> 00:20:10.671
Whoa, cool. It's like some
kind of matter phase shifter.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.219
All right, coming up.

00:20:22.558 --> 00:20:24.685
Hey, Big Bird.
This doesn't belong to you.

00:20:25.978 --> 00:20:27.479
Oh, God.

00:20:34.278 --> 00:20:36.780
- Suit lady, what was that?!
<i>- You told me to choose.</i>

00:20:37.781 --> 00:20:40.325
What? No, just set
everything back to normal.

00:20:40.826 --> 00:20:42.744
<i>Activating all systems.</i>

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:58.006
So, I have the nuclear code.

00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:01.635
But there he is.

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:06.348
- Captain America!
- America.

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:12.646
Finally, the Red
Guardian's time has come!

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:16.024
I grab hold of his shield

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.905
and face to face,
it's a test of strength.

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:29.204
Oh... Oh, no.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.082
Oh...

00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:35.586
That guy think he
going to beat me.

00:21:35.752 --> 00:21:38.255
Anyway, this shield, you
know, that he carries with him

00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:41.216
like a precious baby
blanket, you know?

00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:43.552
I use it to my advantage.
I take it

00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:44.803
and I push him out the window.

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:47.431
And I make my escape. Huh?

00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:49.641
What year was this?

00:21:50.767 --> 00:21:53.270
I don't know. Like, '83, '84.

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:54.438
I know.

00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:57.816
Captain America was
still frozen in ice then.

00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:04.156
Are you calling me
a liar, Ursa, huh?

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:16.460
<i>Alexei Shostakov! Mail Call.</i>

00:22:17.085 --> 00:22:19.171
Oh, no.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.340
Uh-oh.

00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:23.133
<i>Alexei Shostakov! Mail Call.</i>

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.843
Aw, look at the big bear.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.678
Gonna cry, little girl?

00:23:39.543 --> 00:23:41.545
Today is your lucky day, Alexei.

00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:45.632
Move to the door
on the south wall.

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:55.642
What's up with you?

00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:56.977
Can't you read?

00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:08.697
Go left.

00:24:10.157 --> 00:24:11.199
Just don't make a scene.

00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:28.634
You made a scene, didn't you?

00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:42.272
What now?

00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:44.274
We're gettin' you outta here.

00:25:05.379 --> 00:25:06.505
Go to the upper level.

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:11.510
Move your ass, super soldier.

00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:25.065
He's never going to make it.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.650
Get me closer.

00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:29.194
You got a better idea?

00:25:33.282 --> 00:25:34.408
Natasha.

00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:47.588
Such a poser.

00:26:12.154 --> 00:26:13.655
Seriously?

00:26:15.157 --> 00:26:16.241
Whoo!

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:18.118
Sorry!

00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:22.497
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:24.333
Back up!

00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:27.169
We're both doing
a really good job.

00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:38.305
No.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.100
Okay. Enough of this.

00:26:58.742 --> 00:26:59.743
Ha!

00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:09.628
Whoa...

00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:16.802
This would be a cool way to die.

00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:22.849
Tell me that's a
good sign for us!

00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:24.142
Move your ass!

00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:50.210
Get us outta here!

00:27:50.919 --> 00:27:52.004
Huh.

00:28:35.756 --> 00:28:37.799
Wait!

00:29:04.117 --> 00:29:05.285
Yes!

00:29:26.063 --> 00:29:28.023
Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?

00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:29.183
Oh...

00:29:29.903 --> 00:29:32.303
No one has ever asked
me a personal question.

00:29:32.623 --> 00:29:34.223
Your antennae,
what are they for?

00:29:34.823 --> 00:29:35.943
Their purpose?

00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:37.943
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

00:29:38.023 --> 00:29:40.223
Dude. You're not
supposed to say that!

00:29:41.143 --> 00:29:42.263
I say...

00:29:42.423 --> 00:29:44.863
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

00:29:44.943 --> 00:29:47.783
your antennae will feel this, and
keep you from being decapitated.

00:29:47.863 --> 00:29:50.103
Right. And if it's
anything other than...

00:29:50.143 --> 00:29:53.703
you specifically not being
decapitated by a doorway, I win.

00:29:53.783 --> 00:29:56.303
They are not for
feeling doorways.

00:29:58.223 --> 00:29:59.263
I think...

00:29:59.423 --> 00:30:02.183
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

00:30:02.783 --> 00:30:03.783
What are those?

00:30:03.863 --> 00:30:07.423
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

00:30:08.463 --> 00:30:10.223
You read minds? No.

00:30:10.303 --> 00:30:12.583
Telepaths know thoughts.

00:30:12.783 --> 00:30:15.263
Empaths feel feelings.

00:30:16.503 --> 00:30:17.503
Emotions.

00:30:20.063 --> 00:30:21.183
May I?

00:30:22.263 --> 00:30:23.823
All right.

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:34.543
You feel love.

00:30:36.143 --> 00:30:37.623
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,

00:30:37.743 --> 00:30:39.183
unselfish love for
just about everybody.

00:30:39.303 --> 00:30:40.423
No!

00:30:40.583 --> 00:30:42.583
Romantic, sexual love.

00:30:42.703 --> 00:30:44.063
No, I don't.

00:30:44.223 --> 00:30:45.903
For her! No!

00:30:49.263 --> 00:30:50.463
Okay.

00:30:53.423 --> 00:30:55.583
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!

00:30:55.743 --> 00:30:58.063
Dude, I think you're
overreacting a little bit!

00:30:58.223 --> 00:30:59.663
You must be so embarrassed!

00:31:03.463 --> 00:31:05.343
Do me! Do me!

00:31:10.623 --> 00:31:13.623
I have never felt such humor!

00:31:17.103 --> 00:31:19.183
So unbelievably uncool.

00:31:20.503 --> 00:31:21.903
Oh, Quill.

00:31:24.263 --> 00:31:28.303
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

00:31:33.583 --> 00:31:37.343
I can also alter
emotions to some extent.

00:31:37.423 --> 00:31:38.503
Yeah, like what?

00:31:39.263 --> 00:31:42.383
If I touch someone who is sad...

00:31:42.543 --> 00:31:45.303
I can ease them into
contentment for a short while.

00:31:45.463 --> 00:31:49.263
I can make a stubborn
person compliant.

00:31:49.423 --> 00:31:52.503
But I mostly use it to
help my master sleep.

00:31:52.663 --> 00:31:56.543
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

00:31:58.703 --> 00:31:59.903
Do one of those on me.

00:32:04.423 --> 00:32:06.143
Sleep.

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:18.570
My head.

00:32:18.737 --> 00:32:21.615
<i>You appear to have
a mild concussion.</i>

00:32:23.742 --> 00:32:26.912
Hey, so where am I right now?

00:32:27.079 --> 00:32:28.205
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

00:32:28.747 --> 00:32:30.916
<i>The container walls are
hindering my sensors.</i>

00:32:32.626 --> 00:32:33.960
Wait a minute.

00:32:34.127 --> 00:32:37.672
They must have hijacked the
truck and taken me to their evil lair.

00:32:38.173 --> 00:32:41.593
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna
have to fight our way out of this one.

00:32:41.968 --> 00:32:44.012
Three, two, one.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.270
What is this place?

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:53.688
Suit lady, where am I?

00:32:53.855 --> 00:32:56.775
<i>You're in the most secure
facility on the Eastern Seaboard.</i>

00:32:56.942 --> 00:32:58.527
<i>The Damage Control
deep-storage vault.</i>

00:32:58.693 --> 00:33:01.905
No. Seriously? Argh!

00:33:04.241 --> 00:33:06.535
<i>The door will most likely
remain closed until morning.</i>

00:33:06.701 --> 00:33:07.994
Morning?

00:33:08.161 --> 00:33:13.250
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?

00:33:13.417 --> 00:33:15.710
I think I should probably
give you a name.

00:33:15.877 --> 00:33:18.213
Like Liz. No, no, no.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.382
God, that's-- That's weird.

00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:22.926
What about Karen?

00:33:23.343 --> 00:33:25.178
<i>You can call me
Karen if you would like.</i>

00:33:25.345 --> 00:33:28.473
Hey, Karen, what
else can this suit do?

00:33:28.932 --> 00:33:30.559
What?

00:33:30.725 --> 00:33:32.644
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.

00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:34.396
<i>- Ricochet web.</i>
- Ricochet web.

00:33:34.563 --> 00:33:38.024
- Whoa. Cool.
<i>- Splitter web.</i>

00:33:39.192 --> 00:33:42.070
<i>- Web grenade.</i>
- Web grenade!

00:33:43.822 --> 00:33:46.491
Should I tell Liz
that I'm Spider-Man?

00:33:46.658 --> 00:33:47.743
<i>Who is Liz?</i>

00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:50.537
Who's Liz? Heh.
She's-- Heh, heh.

00:33:50.704 --> 00:33:52.164
She's the best. She's awesome.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:55.041
She's just a girl who
goes to my school.

00:33:55.208 --> 00:33:56.251
And, uh--

00:33:56.418 --> 00:34:00.338
Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:03.717
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."

00:34:03.884 --> 00:34:05.010
<i>What's weird about that?</i>

00:34:05.177 --> 00:34:07.220
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?

00:34:07.387 --> 00:34:09.389
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.

00:34:09.556 --> 00:34:13.101
<i>Well, if I were her, I wouldn't
be disappointed at all.</i>

00:34:13.268 --> 00:34:14.770
Thanks, Karen.

00:34:14.936 --> 00:34:17.689
It's really nice to have
somebody to talk to.

00:34:17.856 --> 00:34:19.691
Hey, how long we
been here anyways?

00:34:19.858 --> 00:34:21.735
<i>- Thirty-seven minutes.</i>
- What?!

00:34:21.902 --> 00:34:23.612
Thirty-seven minutes?
That's insane.

00:34:23.779 --> 00:34:27.449
I cannot take this anymore.
I got to-- I gotta get out of here.

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:32.204
There's got to be
something in here I can use.

00:34:33.246 --> 00:34:34.998
Okay, let's see.

00:34:35.165 --> 00:34:36.708
Nope.

00:34:37.918 --> 00:34:39.086
That's awesome.

00:34:39.294 --> 00:34:40.796
Oh.

00:34:40.962 --> 00:34:42.172
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.

00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:45.342
<i>That glowy thing is an
explosive Chitauri energy core.</i>

00:34:45.509 --> 00:34:47.511
You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?

00:34:47.677 --> 00:34:51.389
<i>It would require radiation to
transform it into an explosive state.</i>

00:34:52.808 --> 00:34:54.226
No, no, no.

00:34:58.105 --> 00:35:00.982
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!

00:35:01.149 --> 00:35:03.068
Karen, you have to help
me override that time lock.

00:35:03.819 --> 00:35:05.821
Okay, Karen, lower
the voltage and run it.

00:35:05.987 --> 00:35:07.489
<i>Trial unsuccessful.</i>

00:35:07.656 --> 00:35:08.949
Okay, we're just gonna
have to try every sequence.

00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:16.039
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.

00:35:16.206 --> 00:35:18.417
Okay. Uh, hold on, hold on.

00:35:22.295 --> 00:35:25.382
<i>Initiating trial 247.</i>

00:35:25.924 --> 00:35:27.300
It worked. It works.

00:35:39.771 --> 00:35:43.358
Please be sure all cell
phones are turned off.

00:35:43.525 --> 00:35:44.568
Thank you.

00:35:44.734 --> 00:35:46.611
Karen, get me to decathlon
as fast as possible.

00:35:46.778 --> 00:35:47.904
<i>Sure thing.
Just tell me where it is.</i>

00:35:48.071 --> 00:35:49.698
Across the street from
the Washington Monument.

00:35:49.865 --> 00:35:50.866
<i>It's Ned. Leave a message.</i>

00:35:51.032 --> 00:35:52.868
Call me back.
The glowy thing's a bomb!

00:35:58.498 --> 00:36:00.834
<i>There's a vehicle
approaching on your right.</i>

00:36:01.001 --> 00:36:03.211
We have now
entered sudden death.

00:36:03.378 --> 00:36:06.173
The next correct answer
wins the championship.

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.429
Midtown Tech?

00:36:12.596 --> 00:36:14.222
Zero.

00:36:14.389 --> 00:36:15.432
That is correct.

00:36:16.183 --> 00:36:18.477
Midtown takes the championship.

00:36:18.685 --> 00:36:21.980
- Woo-hoo! We won.
- You guys, I am so proud of you.

00:36:22.147 --> 00:36:25.317
- Told you we didn't need Peter.
- Flash, you didn't answer a question.

00:36:25.484 --> 00:36:28.445
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just, um--

00:36:28.612 --> 00:36:30.947
I don't want to celebrate
something that was built by slaves.

00:36:31.114 --> 00:36:33.575
I'm sure the Washington
Monument wasn't built by--

00:36:37.037 --> 00:36:38.080
Okay.

00:36:38.538 --> 00:36:40.707
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.

00:36:43.293 --> 00:36:45.754
- Oh, Ned, you're alive.
- Peter, are you okay?

00:36:45.921 --> 00:36:47.506
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:51.259
- It's safe. It's in my backpack.
- Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous.

00:36:51.426 --> 00:36:53.011
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.

00:36:53.178 --> 00:36:55.097
- Listen to me!
- We're at the Washington Monument.

00:36:55.263 --> 00:36:56.640
- Peter, is that you?
- Hey, Liz.

00:36:56.807 --> 00:36:58.225
<i>- Is that Liz?</i>
- Put Ned back on the phone.

00:36:58.391 --> 00:37:01.520
<i>- You should tell her how you feel.</i>
- You flake. You are lucky we won.

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:05.273
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.942
I have to talk to Ned.
It's important.

00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:08.276
All items on the belt, please.

00:37:08.443 --> 00:37:09.444
<i>There's something
in Ned's backpack.</i>

00:37:09.611 --> 00:37:11.613
<i>It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through an x-ray.</i>

00:37:14.533 --> 00:37:16.701
Liz? Liz! Damn it.

00:37:20.205 --> 00:37:22.499
Can I be the one to
tell Peter he's expelled?

00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:32.467
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.

00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:37.222
Notice how the marble and
granite are cut around the stone.

00:37:44.646 --> 00:37:47.065
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:49.568
<i>The Chitauri core
has detonated...</i>

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:51.736
<i>...and caused severe
structural damage to the elevator.</i>

00:37:51.903 --> 00:37:53.113
- Oh, no.
- My friends are up there.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.824
What? Uh, don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.

00:37:55.991 --> 00:37:58.076
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my God, that's tall.

00:38:04.166 --> 00:38:05.667
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.

00:38:05.834 --> 00:38:07.335
Just stay calm, everyone.

00:38:07.502 --> 00:38:09.171
Oh, we are all
going to die here.

00:38:11.798 --> 00:38:14.468
<i>Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.</i>

00:38:14.634 --> 00:38:16.136
We're freaking screwed.

00:38:16.303 --> 00:38:19.431
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.

00:38:19.598 --> 00:38:22.017
<i>The safety systems
are completely failing.</i>

00:38:22.184 --> 00:38:23.852
We're very safe in here.

00:38:24.019 --> 00:38:26.605
<i>The occupants are in
imminent mortal danger.</i>

00:38:26.772 --> 00:38:27.856
Going as fast as I can!

00:38:37.574 --> 00:38:38.909
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.

00:38:40.327 --> 00:38:42.621
<i>You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.</i>

00:38:42.788 --> 00:38:43.830
What?! Why?

00:38:44.331 --> 00:38:47.334
<i>Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.</i>

00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:50.962
- How do I get in there?
<i>- Activating reconnaissance drone.</i>

00:38:52.923 --> 00:38:55.717
Whoa. Has that been there
this whole time? That's awesome.

00:38:56.176 --> 00:38:58.428
<i>Locating optimal entry point.</i>

00:39:00.138 --> 00:39:01.807
<i>Proceed to southwest window.</i>

00:39:01.973 --> 00:39:03.725
Karen, I'm on my way.

00:39:08.271 --> 00:39:10.273
- There's a lot of glass here.
- You got this.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.650
Keep coming, keep coming.

00:39:25.705 --> 00:39:27.707
Okay. Oh, my God.

00:39:27.874 --> 00:39:29.543
Okay.

00:39:31.211 --> 00:39:33.255
<i>What's wrong?
You've reached the southwest window.</i>

00:39:33.422 --> 00:39:35.173
<i>- Why are you hesitating?</i>
- It's fine.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.050
I've just never been
this high before.

00:39:37.217 --> 00:39:39.386
<i>You have also not
reinstalled your parachute...</i>

00:39:39.553 --> 00:39:42.264
<i>...so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.</i>

00:39:42.472 --> 00:39:43.723
Oh.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.350
Perfect.

00:39:45.517 --> 00:39:47.102
Oh, my God.

00:39:48.645 --> 00:39:49.771
Why is it not breaking?

00:39:49.938 --> 00:39:53.608
<i>It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.</i>

00:40:12.836 --> 00:40:15.172
This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.

00:40:15.338 --> 00:40:16.923
My friends are in there! Stop!

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:18.842
Return to the
ground immediately.

00:40:19.009 --> 00:40:21.011
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, it's my turn.

00:40:21.178 --> 00:40:23.013
Flash, seriously?
What are you doing?

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.141
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.

00:40:33.607 --> 00:40:34.775
Stand down!

00:40:34.941 --> 00:40:37.694
Return to the
ground immediately.

00:40:41.865 --> 00:40:43.867
Return to the ground
or we will open fire!

00:40:44.034 --> 00:40:45.869
Go up, go up.

00:40:46.703 --> 00:40:48.080
I got this.

00:40:48.246 --> 00:40:49.915
Take my trophy.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.960
This is your last chance.

00:40:54.127 --> 00:40:56.171
I'm gonna die.

00:40:56.838 --> 00:40:58.298
Look out!

00:41:05.013 --> 00:41:06.473
Break!

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:21.738
I did it. Whoa!

00:41:35.335 --> 00:41:37.295
Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry. I got you.

00:41:37.754 --> 00:41:40.298
- Yes! Yes.
- Hey, hey.

00:41:40.465 --> 00:41:42.551
- Big guy, quit moving around.
- I'm sorry, sir.

00:41:46.179 --> 00:41:47.222
Let's go, let's go!

00:41:53.103 --> 00:41:54.146
Okay, okay.

00:41:54.312 --> 00:41:56.273
- Mr. Harrington, go.
- Ned, come on.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.233
- This is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.319
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.

00:42:01.486 --> 00:42:02.988
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz.

00:42:03.905 --> 00:42:05.115
Liz!

00:42:09.327 --> 00:42:10.996
You're okay. You're okay.

00:42:14.499 --> 00:42:15.876
Okay.

00:42:16.418 --> 00:42:17.711
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.

00:42:17.878 --> 00:42:19.755
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.

00:42:19.921 --> 00:42:21.923
- Come on in.
- You guys good?

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:23.467
So is everyone okay?

00:42:24.926 --> 00:42:26.928
<i>This is your chance, Peter.</i>

00:42:27.095 --> 00:42:28.930
<i>Kiss her.</i>

00:42:32.684 --> 00:42:34.352
Thank you.

00:42:37.355 --> 00:42:39.900
Are you really friends
with Peter Parker?

00:42:43.794 --> 00:42:45.462
Oh, that was exciting.

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:50.676
Oh, I'm so proud of you girls.

00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:54.263
Oh, you can't hear me, huh?

00:42:54.346 --> 00:42:56.432
Okay.

00:42:57.433 --> 00:42:59.643
Ah...

00:43:00.269 --> 00:43:01.270
Wow.

00:43:04.189 --> 00:43:06.317
Okay.

00:43:07.526 --> 00:43:09.403
Why the aggression, huh?

00:43:10.195 --> 00:43:11.655
Is it your time of the month?

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:15.242
I don't get my period, dipshit.
I don't have a uterus.

00:43:15.534 --> 00:43:16.618
Or ovaries.

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:19.079
Yeah.
That's what happens when the Red Room

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:20.581
gives you an
involuntary hysterectomy.

00:43:20.748 --> 00:43:25.294
They kind of just go in and they rip
out all of your reproductive organs.

00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:28.922
They just get right in there
and they chop them all away.

00:43:29.089 --> 00:43:31.925
- Everything out, so you can't have babies.
- Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!

00:43:32.092 --> 00:43:34.595
You don't have to get
so clinical and nasty.

00:43:34.762 --> 00:43:36.263
Oh, well, I was
about to talk about

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:38.599
- fallopian tubes, but okay.
- No.

00:43:39.224 --> 00:43:44.980
It means so much to me
that you came back for me.

00:43:45.147 --> 00:43:48.734
No. No. You're gonna tell us
how to get to the Red Room.

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:50.402
Huh.

00:43:50.486 --> 00:43:52.279
Whoa, look at you, huh?
All business.

00:43:52.446 --> 00:43:53.864
Trust me, this isn't pleasure.

00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:58.077
Little Natasha, all indoctrinated
into the Western agenda.

00:43:58.577 --> 00:44:01.372
I chose to go west to
become an Avenger.

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.499
'Cause they treated
me like family.

00:44:03.666 --> 00:44:05.501
Really? Family?

00:44:05.668 --> 00:44:07.962
Well, where are they now?

00:44:08.128 --> 00:44:10.798
Where is that family now?

00:44:10.965 --> 00:44:12.967
Tell me where the Red Room is.

00:44:15.302 --> 00:44:18.097
I have no idea.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.348
Okay?

00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:25.980
Come on. You and
Dreykov were like...

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:27.147
- Dreykov?
- Yeah.

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:29.650
General Dreykov, my friend, huh?

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:32.152
Gives me glory...

00:44:32.319 --> 00:44:35.322
Soviet Union's first
and only super soldier.

00:44:35.489 --> 00:44:38.659
I could have been more
famous than Captain America.

00:44:38.826 --> 00:44:42.246
Then he buries me in
Ohio on that stupid mission.

00:44:42.413 --> 00:44:43.831
Three years!

00:44:43.998 --> 00:44:46.959
So tedious, boring me to tears.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.380
No offense, huh?

00:44:52.381 --> 00:44:54.883
Then puts me in prison for
the rest of my life. Why, huh?

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:56.427
Why? Why would he put me in...
You know why?

00:44:56.593 --> 00:44:59.263
'Cause maybe I want to talk
about the withering of the state.

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.015
Or maybe I don't like
his hair or something

00:45:01.098 --> 00:45:02.349
and I say something
casually about that.

00:45:02.516 --> 00:45:03.517
Maybe, you know,

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.644
I want the Party to
feel actually like a party

00:45:05.811 --> 00:45:08.188
instead of this
sourpuss organization.

00:45:08.981 --> 00:45:10.524
But instead, no.

00:45:10.899 --> 00:45:13.694
He puts me in prison
for the rest of my life.

00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:15.988
He just runs off and hides, huh?

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.908
I'm not even the one
who, uh, you know...

00:45:22.077 --> 00:45:23.912
I'm not the one who
killed his daughter.

00:45:25.289 --> 00:45:27.041
Can we throw him
out the window now?

00:45:27.207 --> 00:45:29.126
I think we should wait till
we get to a higher altitude.

00:45:29.209 --> 00:45:30.210
All right.

00:45:33.047 --> 00:45:34.089
Wait, Mom Melina?

00:45:34.256 --> 00:45:36.258
We thought she was dead.

00:45:36.342 --> 00:45:39.136
You cannot kill
a fox that swift.

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:40.471
- Ew.
- What?

00:45:41.013 --> 00:45:45.225
She was the scientist, the strategist.
I was the muscle.

00:45:45.392 --> 00:45:47.895
She worked directly for
Dreykov far more than I ever did.

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:51.523
Wait. Are you telling me that Melina is
working for the Red Room present day?

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:53.942
She works remotely
outside St. Petersburg.

00:45:54.026 --> 00:45:55.861
Uh...

00:45:56.195 --> 00:45:58.781
I don't think we have enough
fuel for St. Petersburg.

00:45:58.947 --> 00:46:00.532
No, we're good.
We'll make it.

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:02.159
Okay.

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:24.723
You should've brought
the Avengers' superjet.

00:46:28.894 --> 00:46:30.854
I swear, if I hear one
more word from him,

00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.856
- I will kick him in the face.
- He's the worst.

00:46:33.357 --> 00:46:34.942
Natasha.

00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:36.485
Natasha. Natasha.

00:46:36.652 --> 00:46:39.571
Come here, I want
to ask you something.

00:46:39.738 --> 00:46:41.657
- Come, it's important.
- What?

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.746
Did he talk to you about me?

00:46:48.998 --> 00:46:50.124
What?

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:54.295
Did he talk to you about me?
You know, trading war stories?

00:46:54.461 --> 00:46:55.462
Who? What are you talking about?

00:46:55.629 --> 00:46:57.881
Captain America.

00:46:58.048 --> 00:47:03.012
My great adversary in this
theater of geopolitical conflict.

00:47:03.178 --> 00:47:05.014
Not so much a nemesis.

00:47:05.097 --> 00:47:07.099
More like a contemporary,
you know? Coequal.

00:47:07.266 --> 00:47:09.476
I always thought there was a
great deal of mutual respect...

00:47:09.643 --> 00:47:11.687
Wait. You haven't seen
either one of us in 20 years

00:47:11.854 --> 00:47:13.397
and you're gonna
ask me about you?

00:47:14.648 --> 00:47:16.692
What is with this tension?

00:47:18.652 --> 00:47:19.945
Did I do something wrong?

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:23.115
Is that a serious question?

00:47:24.366 --> 00:47:26.368
I only ever loved you girls.

00:47:26.994 --> 00:47:29.038
I did my best to make
sure you would succeed

00:47:29.204 --> 00:47:31.040
to achieve your
fullest potential,

00:47:31.123 --> 00:47:32.875
- and everything worked out.
- Everything worked out?

00:47:33.042 --> 00:47:35.419
Yes. For you, yes.

00:47:36.962 --> 00:47:39.548
We accomplished
our mission in Ohio.

00:47:40.132 --> 00:47:43.093
Yelena, you went on to become
the greatest child assassin

00:47:43.177 --> 00:47:44.470
the world has ever known.

00:47:44.637 --> 00:47:48.599
No one can match your
efficiency, your ruthlessness.

00:47:48.891 --> 00:47:50.726
And Natasha,

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:55.773
not just a spy, not
just toppling regimes,

00:47:55.939 --> 00:47:58.067
destroying empires from within,

00:47:58.651 --> 00:48:00.402
but an Avenger.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.281
You both have killed

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:06.825
so many people.

00:48:07.576 --> 00:48:11.080
Your ledgers must be
dripping, just gushing red.

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:13.832
I couldn't be more proud of you.

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:19.588
Okay. You can... No.

00:48:19.755 --> 00:48:21.507
Let go of me now.

00:48:21.674 --> 00:48:23.467
You smell really bad.

00:49:09.801 --> 00:49:13.281
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

00:49:13.441 --> 00:49:15.921
Wow. You have your own planet?

00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:19.801
Come on. No larger
than your Earth's Moon.

00:49:20.001 --> 00:49:21.481
Humility.

00:49:21.641 --> 00:49:23.041
I like it.

00:49:23.441 --> 00:49:25.881
I, too, am
extraordinarily humble.

00:50:08.241 --> 00:50:10.281
You own a planet and can destroy

00:50:10.361 --> 00:50:12.361
two dozen spaceships
without a suit.

00:50:13.041 --> 00:50:14.841
What are you exactly?

00:50:16.001 --> 00:50:19.321
I'm what's called a
Celestial, sweetheart.

00:50:20.561 --> 00:50:23.161
A Celestial, like a god?

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:26.721
Mmm, small "g," son.

00:50:26.881 --> 00:50:29.721
At least on the days I'm
feeling humble as Drax.

00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:42.241
Whoa!

00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:47.561
I don't know where
I came from exactly.

00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:49.761
First thing I remember
is flickering...

00:50:50.281 --> 00:50:52.201
adrift in the cosmos utterly...

00:50:53.121 --> 00:50:55.721
and entirely alone.

00:50:56.761 --> 00:50:58.641
Over millions of years...

00:50:58.801 --> 00:51:02.361
I learned to control the
molecules around me.

00:51:02.721 --> 00:51:05.881
I grew smarter and stronger.

00:51:07.801 --> 00:51:10.761
And I continued
building from there...

00:51:10.921 --> 00:51:13.041
layer by layer...

00:51:13.201 --> 00:51:15.801
the very planet you walk on now.

00:51:15.961 --> 00:51:17.281
Whoa.

00:51:17.921 --> 00:51:19.161
But I wanted more.

00:51:20.281 --> 00:51:21.921
I desired...

00:51:22.441 --> 00:51:23.601
meaning.

00:51:24.761 --> 00:51:28.721
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...

00:51:28.921 --> 00:51:31.641
"besides just me," I thought.

00:51:31.841 --> 00:51:35.841
And so, I set myself
the task of finding it.

00:51:36.161 --> 00:51:37.601
I created...

00:51:37.801 --> 00:51:41.441
what I imagined
biological life to be like...

00:51:41.641 --> 00:51:45.321
down to the most minute detail.

00:51:46.481 --> 00:51:47.881
Did you make a penis?

00:51:47.961 --> 00:51:49.161
Dude!

00:51:49.361 --> 00:51:50.521
What is wrong with you?

00:51:50.681 --> 00:51:51.681
If he is a planet,

00:51:51.761 --> 00:51:53.881
how could he make a
baby with your mother?

00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:54.961
He would smush her!

00:51:57.121 --> 00:51:59.321
I don't need to hear
how my parents...

00:52:00.561 --> 00:52:01.561
Why?

00:52:02.321 --> 00:52:04.001
My father would tell the story

00:52:04.001 --> 00:52:06.041
of impregnating my
mother every winter solstice.

00:52:06.121 --> 00:52:07.481
That's disgusting.

00:52:07.641 --> 00:52:09.161
It was beautiful.

00:52:10.401 --> 00:52:12.161
You Earthers have hang-ups.

00:52:12.481 --> 00:52:14.641
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

00:52:14.841 --> 00:52:16.441
Ha! Thank you!

00:52:16.601 --> 00:52:17.801
It's not half bad.

00:52:17.961 --> 00:52:19.401
Oh. Ugh.

00:52:19.601 --> 00:52:23.121
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

00:52:23.281 --> 00:52:25.081
and all the accompanying junk.

00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:30.161
I wanted to experience what
it truly meant to be human...

00:52:30.321 --> 00:52:33.361
as I set out
amongst the stars...

00:52:34.001 --> 00:52:36.161
until I found...

00:52:36.361 --> 00:52:38.001
what I sought.

00:52:39.601 --> 00:52:40.761
Life.

00:52:42.521 --> 00:52:44.921
I was not alone in
the universe after all.

00:52:51.641 --> 00:52:53.481
When did you meet my mother?

00:52:57.681 --> 00:52:59.361
Not long after.

00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:09.721
It was with Meredith that
I first experienced love.

00:53:13.641 --> 00:53:16.801
I called her my river lily.

00:53:21.041 --> 00:53:23.681
And from that love, Peter...

00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:28.401
you.

00:53:35.761 --> 00:53:39.241
I have searched
for you for so long.

00:53:40.841 --> 00:53:42.641
And when I heard
of a man from Earth...

00:53:42.721 --> 00:53:46.401
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

00:53:48.201 --> 00:53:51.241
I knew you must be the
son of the woman I loved.

00:53:52.761 --> 00:53:55.161
If you loved her, why
did you leave her?

00:54:02.638 --> 00:54:06.238
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

00:54:07.918 --> 00:54:10.478
She had brain cancer, so
everyone thought she was delusional.

00:54:10.558 --> 00:54:11.638
Peter...

00:54:11.718 --> 00:54:13.598
Listen, I'd love to believe
all of this, I really would.

00:54:13.638 --> 00:54:15.118
But you left...

00:54:15.198 --> 00:54:18.078
the most wonderful woman ever...

00:54:18.238 --> 00:54:19.798
to die alone.

00:54:19.878 --> 00:54:23.278
I didn't want to leave
your mother, Peter.

00:54:23.438 --> 00:54:25.718
If I don't return
regularly to my planet...

00:54:25.798 --> 00:54:27.158
and the light within it...

00:54:27.318 --> 00:54:28.958
this form will
wither and perish.

00:54:29.038 --> 00:54:31.158
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

00:54:31.238 --> 00:54:33.238
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

00:54:33.598 --> 00:54:35.558
I loved your mother, Peter!

00:54:35.638 --> 00:54:38.038
I couldn't stand to
set foot on an Earth...

00:54:38.238 --> 00:54:39.478
where she wasn't living!

00:54:39.558 --> 00:54:41.118
You can't imagine
what that's like!

00:54:41.238 --> 00:54:43.638
I know exactly
what that feels like!

00:54:43.798 --> 00:54:45.518
I had to watch her die!

00:54:49.918 --> 00:54:54.118
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

00:54:54.198 --> 00:54:56.678
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

00:54:57.518 --> 00:54:59.798
But you're not one of them.

00:55:01.518 --> 00:55:03.318
Please give me the
chance to be the father

00:55:03.478 --> 00:55:05.318
she would want me to be.

00:55:10.059 --> 00:55:15.358
There's so much that I need
to teach you about this planet...

00:55:15.518 --> 00:55:17.198
and the light within.

00:55:17.558 --> 00:55:20.758
They are a part of you, Peter.

00:55:21.638 --> 00:55:23.318
What do you mean?

00:55:24.078 --> 00:55:25.998
Give me your hands, son.

00:55:26.958 --> 00:55:28.078
Here.

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:30.838
Hold them like that.

00:55:36.718 --> 00:55:39.598
Now, close your
eyes and concentrate.

00:55:40.718 --> 00:55:43.838
Take your brain to the
center of this planet.

00:55:48.718 --> 00:55:49.718
Yes!

00:55:49.838 --> 00:55:50.838
Yes!

00:55:50.918 --> 00:55:52.638
Whoa!

00:55:52.798 --> 00:55:54.198
Yes! It's okay.

00:55:54.398 --> 00:55:55.558
Just relax. Concentrate.

00:55:55.598 --> 00:55:57.798
You can do it. Bring it back.

00:55:58.238 --> 00:55:59.398
Yes!

00:56:00.998 --> 00:56:03.758
Yes, now shape it.

00:56:04.158 --> 00:56:05.838
Feel that energy.

00:56:09.998 --> 00:56:11.038
Yes.

00:56:15.278 --> 00:56:16.678
You're home.

00:56:19.198 --> 00:56:20.318
Peter...

00:56:54.838 --> 00:56:57.758
How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?

00:56:58.358 --> 00:57:01.238
Ego found me in my larva state.

00:57:01.398 --> 00:57:02.918
Orphaned on my homeworld.

00:57:03.838 --> 00:57:06.478
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:09.318
So you're a pet?

00:57:10.558 --> 00:57:11.838
I suppose.

00:57:13.358 --> 00:57:15.758
People usually want cute pets.

00:57:15.918 --> 00:57:18.158
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?

00:57:18.318 --> 00:57:19.638
I am hideous?

00:57:19.798 --> 00:57:22.038
You are horrifying
to look at. Yes.

00:57:25.118 --> 00:57:26.318
But that's a good thing.

00:57:26.438 --> 00:57:27.438
Oh?

00:57:27.798 --> 00:57:29.478
When you're ugly, and
someone loves you...

00:57:29.518 --> 00:57:32.078
you know they love
you for who you are.

00:57:33.398 --> 00:57:35.798
Beautiful people
never know who to trust.

00:57:36.678 --> 00:57:39.638
Well, then I'm certainly
grateful to be ugly.

00:57:41.118 --> 00:57:44.238
Those pools, they
remind me of a time...

00:57:44.398 --> 00:57:47.998
when I took my daughter to the
forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

00:57:49.158 --> 00:57:50.478
She was like you.

00:57:50.878 --> 00:57:52.398
Disgusting?

00:57:53.398 --> 00:57:54.598
Innocent.

00:58:27.878 --> 00:58:28.878
Drax?

00:58:30.478 --> 00:58:32.158
There's something
I must tell you.

00:58:40.598 --> 00:58:41.718
What's going on?

00:58:41.798 --> 00:58:43.718
This gross bug lady
is my new friend.

00:58:43.878 --> 00:58:47.358
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

00:58:47.678 --> 00:58:49.278
You're not ugly. Drax!

00:58:49.438 --> 00:58:50.678
What are you talking about?

00:58:50.838 --> 00:58:51.998
Mantis...

00:58:52.478 --> 00:58:54.598
can you show us
where we'll be staying?

00:58:55.118 --> 00:58:56.878
Why are there no other
beings on this planet?

00:58:57.078 --> 00:58:59.118
The planet is Ego.

00:58:59.278 --> 00:59:01.558
A dog would not invite
a flea to live on his back.

00:59:02.278 --> 00:59:03.558
And you're not a flea?

00:59:03.718 --> 00:59:06.038
I'm a flea with a purpose.

00:59:06.638 --> 00:59:08.278
I help him sleep.

00:59:09.438 --> 00:59:12.638
What were you about to say
to Drax before I walked out?

00:59:17.678 --> 00:59:18.798
Nothing.

00:59:19.678 --> 00:59:21.598
Your quarters are this way.

00:59:24.931 --> 00:59:29.811
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck....

00:59:30.395 --> 00:59:32.564
Yeah, damn it.

00:59:33.064 --> 00:59:35.275
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?

00:59:35.441 --> 00:59:37.443
Yeah, but then that's it.

00:59:39.988 --> 00:59:41.030
Oh.

00:59:41.197 --> 00:59:43.658
Maybe it is time that I
built the high-altitude seal.

00:59:43.825 --> 00:59:45.410
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.

00:59:45.577 --> 00:59:47.078
No.

00:59:48.629 --> 00:59:51.571
This little bastard in
red tights shows up,

00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:55.580
and he thinks he can tear
down everything I've built.

00:59:57.082 --> 00:59:58.625
Really?

00:59:59.931 --> 01:00:01.974
- I'm gonna find him--
- I found him.

01:00:03.369 --> 01:00:04.662
<i>The Spider-Man swooped in...</i>

01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:08.082
<i>...heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.</i>

01:00:08.416 --> 01:00:11.127
<i>The identity of the masked
hero is still unknown.</i>

01:00:14.801 --> 01:00:15.969
I'm gonna kill him.
