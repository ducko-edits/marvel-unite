WEBVTT

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.569
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:31.114
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.032
Well, sometimes you
have to get captured

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.784
just to get a straight
answer out of somebody.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.370
It's a long story,

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.414
but basically,
I'm a bit of a hero.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.168
See, I spent some
time on Earth...

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:44.794
fought some robots,

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.504
saved the planet
a couple of times.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.548
Then I went searching
through the cosmos

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:51.676
for some magic, colorful
Infinity Stone things.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.971
Didn't find any.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:56.347
That's when I came across

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.184
a path of death
and destruction...

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.061
which led me all the
way here into this cage...

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:05.023
where I met you.

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.278
Hmm.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:12.864
How much longer do you
think we'll be here?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.507
Thor, son of Odin.

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:34.427
Surtur, son of a bitch.

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:35.512
You're still alive.

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:40.016
I thought my father killed
you a half a million years ago.

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.809
I cannot die.

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:43.728
Not until I fulfill
my destiny...

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.147
and lay waste to your home.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.815
It's funny you
should mention that.

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:50.276
Because I've been having
these terrible dreams of late.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:52.695
Asgard up in flames,
falling to ruins.

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.072
And you, Surtur,

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:55.657
are at the center
of all of them.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:59.661
Then you have seen
Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard.

00:01:59.827 --> 00:02:01.663
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.541
Hang on.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.335
I'll be back around shortly.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:10.463
I really feel like we
were connecting there.

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.592
Okay, so Ragnarok.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:16.344
Tell me about that.
Walk me through it.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.513
My time has come.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.808
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame...

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.644
I shall be restored
to my full might.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.063
I will tower over
the mountains...

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.816
and bury my sword
deep in Asgard's...

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.527
Oh, hang on. Give it a second.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.987
I swear I'm not even moving.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.613
It's just doing this on its own.

00:02:35.863 --> 00:02:38.199
I'm really sorry.

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.076
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:43.871
You're going to put your
crown into the Eternal Flame...

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:46.416
and then you'll suddenly
grow as big as a house?

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:47.750
A mountain!

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.962
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.548
Odin is not on Asgard.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.760
And your absence has
left the throne defenseless.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:02:59.762
Okay, so where is it?
This crown?

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.849
This is my crown, the
source of my power.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.851
Oh, that's a crown.

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.728
I thought it was a big eyebrow.

00:03:06.894 --> 00:03:08.062
It's a crown.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.733
Anyway, it sounds like all I
have to do to stop Ragnarok...

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:13.610
is rip that thing off your head.

00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.488
But Ragnarok has already begun.

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.449
You cannot stop it.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:32.253
I am Asgard's doom,
and so are you.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.007
All will suffer, all will burn.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.884
Oh, that's intense.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.886
To be honest, seeing
you grow really big...

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.555
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.391
But it looks like I'm gonna
have to choose option B...

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.310
where I bust out
of these chains...

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.228
knock that tiara off your head,

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.314
and stash it away
in Asgard's vault.

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:54.484
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:55.735
Why fight it?

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:59.614
Because that's what heroes do.

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.618
Hmm.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.621
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.

00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:08.247
Hmm?

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:09.791
And, now!

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.965
You have made a
grave mistake, Odinson.

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:20.676
I make grave
mistakes all the time.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.390
Everything seems to work out.

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:29.495
Huh?

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.761
Heimdall, I know
it's been a while,

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.847
but I could really
use a fast exit.

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:50.766
Heimdall?

00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:53.644
Heimdall was an idiot.

00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:55.771
This job should
have made him rich.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.191
Now, the job ain't easy...

00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.151
but it does have its benefits.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.695
The Bifrost gives me
access to everything

00:06:02.778 --> 00:06:04.697
the Nine Realms has to offer.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.158
I mean it's all
mine for the taking.

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:09.827
Behold...

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.164
my stuff.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:14.499
Ooh.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.168
I'm particularly fond of these.

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:20.880
I pulled them out of a place
on Midgard called Texas.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:24.091
I even named them. Des and Troy.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.303
You see, when you
put them together...

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:29.347
they destroy.

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:50.368
Heimdall, come on.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.722
Stay!

00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:16.352
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:19.105
<i>Heimdall?</i>

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:20.606
Um... Skurge?

00:07:23.823 --> 00:07:25.158
Is that important?

00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:34.161
You girls are in for a treat.

00:08:33.594 --> 00:08:34.887
Girls!

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.142
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.

00:08:40.434 --> 00:08:42.353
Thanks for scaring
away my company

00:08:42.436 --> 00:08:44.104
and drenching my
workplace in brains.

00:08:44.396 --> 00:08:45.397
Who are you?

00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:47.233
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.

00:08:47.316 --> 00:08:48.442
We fought together on Vanaheim.

00:08:48.818 --> 00:08:50.945
Right. Where is Heimdall?

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.114
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

00:08:54.782 --> 00:08:55.908
Traitor?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.576
Yeah.
Well, you see, Odin charged Heimdall

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.661
with negligence of duty...

00:08:58.953 --> 00:09:00.746
but he disappeared
before the trial.

00:09:01.038 --> 00:09:02.039
Hard to catch a guy

00:09:02.122 --> 00:09:03.123
who can see everything
in the universe.

00:09:03.207 --> 00:09:04.208
Sure.

00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:06.836
Hold on. I'm supposed to
announce your arrival.

00:09:31.026 --> 00:09:32.611
What the hell is that?

00:09:40.578 --> 00:09:43.289
Oh, brother. This is it.

00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:44.832
I take my leave.

00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:47.710
You fool, you didn't listen!

00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:49.003
I'm sorry.

00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:50.212
Lady Sif, get help!

00:09:50.296 --> 00:09:51.297
Somebody, help!

00:09:52.339 --> 00:09:53.632
Sorry for all I've done.

00:09:53.883 --> 00:09:55.551
Shh. It's all right. Hold on.

00:09:55.885 --> 00:09:59.138
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.639
They'd be lucky to have you.

00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:03.642
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

00:10:04.101 --> 00:10:05.603
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.

00:10:05.895 --> 00:10:06.979
I'm a trickster.

00:10:07.271 --> 00:10:08.981
So mischievous.

00:10:09.398 --> 00:10:11.859
Sorry about that time
I turned you into a frog.

00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:13.444
It was a wonderful joke.

00:10:13.819 --> 00:10:15.738
'Twas indeed hilarious.

00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:17.990
You are the savior of Asgard.

00:10:18.407 --> 00:10:20.326
- Tell my story.
- I will.

00:10:20.409 --> 00:10:21.535
Build a statue for me.

00:10:21.827 --> 00:10:23.412
We will build a
big statue for you.

00:10:23.704 --> 00:10:26.457
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.

00:10:27.499 --> 00:10:29.585
I will tell Father what
you did here today.

00:10:30.127 --> 00:10:31.420
I didn't do it for him.

00:10:32.463 --> 00:10:35.257
I didn't do it for him.

00:10:44.016 --> 00:10:46.185
No!

00:10:49.897 --> 00:10:52.608
And so, Loki died
of his wounds...

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.693
giving his life for ours.

00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:57.529
He fought back those
disgusting elves...

00:10:57.821 --> 00:10:59.490
he brought peace to the realm.

00:10:59.782 --> 00:11:01.951
Loki, my boy...

00:11:02.743 --> 00:11:04.411
'twas many moons ago I found you

00:11:04.495 --> 00:11:06.455
on that frostbitten battlefield.

00:11:07.289 --> 00:11:09.708
On that day, I did
not yet see in you...

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.169
Asgard's savior. No.

00:11:12.461 --> 00:11:16.840
You were merely a
little blue baby icicle...

00:11:17.758 --> 00:11:20.844
that melted this
old fool's heart.

00:11:23.222 --> 00:11:25.808
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.

00:11:30.562 --> 00:11:31.563
Father.

00:11:32.648 --> 00:11:33.649
Oh, shit.

00:11:34.274 --> 00:11:36.276
Uh, my son, Thor, has returned!

00:11:36.652 --> 00:11:39.655
Greetings, my boy.

00:11:39.863 --> 00:11:41.407
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?

00:11:41.699 --> 00:11:43.659
<i>The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.</i>

00:11:43.742 --> 00:11:45.661
The people wanted
to commemorate him.

00:11:45.953 --> 00:11:47.162
Ah, indeed they should.

00:11:47.413 --> 00:11:48.622
I like the statue.

00:11:48.914 --> 00:11:50.958
A lot better looking than he
was when he was alive, though.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.960
A little less weaselly,
less greasy, maybe.

00:11:54.378 --> 00:11:56.088
Do you know what this is?

00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:59.967
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!

00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:01.677
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault...

00:12:01.969 --> 00:12:03.595
so it doesn't turn
into a giant monster

00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:05.055
and destroy the whole planet.

00:12:06.432 --> 00:12:08.350
Thank you, dear. Um...

00:12:08.434 --> 00:12:11.103
So it's back to
Midgard for you, is it?

00:12:11.478 --> 00:12:12.479
Nope.

00:12:13.063 --> 00:12:15.607
I've been having this
reoccurring dream lately.

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:18.569
Every night, I see
Asgard fall into ruins.

00:12:18.861 --> 00:12:19.862
That's just a silly dream...

00:12:20.154 --> 00:12:21.989
signs of an
overactive imagination.

00:12:22.281 --> 00:12:23.282
Possibly.

00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:25.200
But then I decide to go
out there and investigate.

00:12:25.534 --> 00:12:26.618
And what do I find,

00:12:26.702 --> 00:12:29.455
but the Nine Realms
completely in chaos.

00:12:29.747 --> 00:12:32.583
Enemies of Asgard
assembling, plotting our demise...

00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:34.293
all while you, Odin,

00:12:34.376 --> 00:12:35.669
the protector of
those Nine Realms...

00:12:35.961 --> 00:12:37.504
are sitting here
in your bathrobe,

00:12:37.588 --> 00:12:38.589
eating grapes.

00:12:38.672 --> 00:12:40.799
Yes, it is best to respect
our neighbors' freedom.

00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:44.053
Yes, of course, the
freedom to be massacred.

00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:48.015
Yes, besides I've
been rather busy myself.

00:12:48.307 --> 00:12:49.308
Watching theater.

00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:51.226
Board meetings, and
security council meetings...

00:12:51.435 --> 00:12:52.519
You're really gonna
make me do it?

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.937
Do what?

00:12:57.524 --> 00:12:59.651
You know that
nothing will stop Mjolnir

00:12:59.735 --> 00:13:01.236
as it returns to my hand.

00:13:01.528 --> 00:13:02.863
Not even your face.

00:13:03.155 --> 00:13:05.240
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

00:13:05.574 --> 00:13:07.951
Then I'll see you on
the other side, brother.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.746
All right, I yield.

00:13:21.048 --> 00:13:22.049
Behold!

00:13:23.008 --> 00:13:24.093
Thor...

00:13:25.283 --> 00:13:26.493
- Odinson.
- No.

00:13:28.867 --> 00:13:30.702
You had one job. Just the one.

00:13:32.434 --> 00:13:33.435
Where's Odin?

00:13:33.727 --> 00:13:35.354
You just couldn't
stay away, could you?

00:13:35.437 --> 00:13:37.397
Everything was fine without you.

00:13:37.689 --> 00:13:40.234
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

00:13:40.609 --> 00:13:41.735
- Ask them.
- Where's Father?

00:13:41.819 --> 00:13:43.445
- Did you kill him?
- You had what you wanted.

00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:44.530
You had the
independence you asked for.

00:13:44.613 --> 00:13:45.739
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:13:45.823 --> 00:13:47.908
Okay. I know
exactly where he is.

00:14:00.295 --> 00:14:02.172
I swear I left him right here.

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:24.445
Good morning.

00:14:26.045 --> 00:14:27.085
How can I help you?

00:14:27.245 --> 00:14:29.125
I was just checking
out these artifacts.

00:14:29.205 --> 00:14:30.405
They tell me you're the expert.

00:14:30.485 --> 00:14:32.765
Ah. You could say that.

00:14:34.325 --> 00:14:35.605
They're beautiful.

00:14:37.725 --> 00:14:39.245
Where's this one from?

00:14:39.405 --> 00:14:40.845
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...

00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:42.285
present day Ghana...

00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:43.525
19th century.

00:14:43.685 --> 00:14:44.685
For real?

00:14:45.965 --> 00:14:47.685
What about this one?

00:14:49.525 --> 00:14:51.485
That one's from the
Edo people of Benin...

00:14:51.645 --> 00:14:53.565
16th century.

00:14:57.245 --> 00:14:59.685
Now, tell me about this one.

00:15:01.085 --> 00:15:03.645
Also from Benin,
seventh century.

00:15:03.725 --> 00:15:05.805
Fula tribe, I believe.

00:15:07.005 --> 00:15:08.285
Nah.

00:15:08.885 --> 00:15:10.125
I beg your pardon?

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:12.165
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin

00:15:12.285 --> 00:15:13.445
but it's from Wakanda.

00:15:13.605 --> 00:15:15.085
And it's made out of vibranium.

00:15:17.405 --> 00:15:18.885
Don't trip.

00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:20.445
I'mma take it off
your hands for you.

00:15:21.845 --> 00:15:23.805
These items aren't for sale.

00:15:24.405 --> 00:15:26.565
How do you think your
ancestors got these?

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:28.245
You think they
paid a fair price?

00:15:28.405 --> 00:15:30.565
Or did they take it, like
they took everything else?

00:15:30.965 --> 00:15:32.645
Sir, I'm going to have to

00:15:32.725 --> 00:15:34.205
ask you to leave.

00:15:34.365 --> 00:15:35.885
You got all this
security in here

00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:37.445
watching me ever
since I walked in.

00:15:37.605 --> 00:15:39.005
But you ain't checking for

00:15:39.085 --> 00:15:41.125
what you put in your body.

00:15:41.205 --> 00:15:42.445
All right, mate. Let's have it.

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.085
Come on, mate. Time.

00:15:44.245 --> 00:15:45.725
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

00:15:46.685 --> 00:15:48.245
Somebody get some help!
Come here!

00:15:48.445 --> 00:15:51.085
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!

00:15:51.245 --> 00:15:52.285
Medical emergency right away

00:15:52.405 --> 00:15:53.765
in the West African
Exhibit, please, right away.

00:15:53.925 --> 00:15:54.925
Look out.

00:15:55.005 --> 00:15:57.645
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.

00:15:57.805 --> 00:16:00.525
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.

00:16:01.445 --> 00:16:03.005
I'm gonna take a break.

00:16:06.725 --> 00:16:08.405
Let's give the lady
some space, please.

00:16:08.565 --> 00:16:09.605
Step back, please, gents.

00:16:09.685 --> 00:16:11.005
Step back, please.

00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:16.765
Hey, come here.

00:16:16.925 --> 00:16:19.845
Come here. It's okay.

00:16:20.485 --> 00:16:23.725
You can go, but just
don't tell anyone, all right?

00:16:29.885 --> 00:16:31.325
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

00:16:31.485 --> 00:16:32.445
Because it's better to leave

00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:33.565
the crime scene more spread out.

00:16:34.725 --> 00:16:36.445
Makes us look like amateurs.

00:16:51.885 --> 00:16:54.405
Now then, let's see if you know

00:16:54.485 --> 00:16:56.085
what you're talking about.

00:17:03.165 --> 00:17:05.005
That's just a taste.

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.445
You're gonna be a rich boy.

00:17:22.525 --> 00:17:23.685
You better sell that quick.

00:17:23.845 --> 00:17:25.485
It's already sold!

00:17:26.325 --> 00:17:27.325
Whatever you try,

00:17:27.405 --> 00:17:28.405
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.

00:17:28.485 --> 00:17:29.965
That'll make my day.

00:17:30.045 --> 00:17:31.325
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

00:17:33.805 --> 00:17:35.765
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?

00:17:35.965 --> 00:17:37.725
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

00:18:14.777 --> 00:18:15.777
Just one?

00:18:22.617 --> 00:18:24.457
Come home, Nakia.

00:18:24.617 --> 00:18:25.857
I'm right here.

00:18:26.017 --> 00:18:27.497
Stay.

00:18:28.137 --> 00:18:31.657
I came to support you
and to honor your father...

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:33.177
but I can't stay.

00:18:35.017 --> 00:18:37.177
I found my calling out there.

00:18:37.897 --> 00:18:40.817
I've seen too many in
need just to turn a blind eye.

00:18:41.497 --> 00:18:42.817
I can't be happy here...

00:18:43.017 --> 00:18:45.697
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.

00:18:47.177 --> 00:18:49.737
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

00:18:50.457 --> 00:18:52.057
Share what we have.

00:18:52.217 --> 00:18:53.737
We could provide aid...

00:18:53.897 --> 00:18:54.897
and access to technology

00:18:54.977 --> 00:18:56.177
and refuge to those who need it.

00:18:56.537 --> 00:18:58.817
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

00:19:00.457 --> 00:19:03.377
We are not like these
other countries, Nakia.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.497
If the world found
out what we truly are...

00:19:06.657 --> 00:19:08.137
what we possess...

00:19:08.297 --> 00:19:09.977
we could lose our way of life.

00:19:10.137 --> 00:19:12.417
Wakanda is strong
enough to help others

00:19:12.537 --> 00:19:14.337
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

00:19:16.097 --> 00:19:19.017
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

00:19:19.217 --> 00:19:21.697
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.

00:19:21.857 --> 00:19:25.377
Ah! See, you admit it!
If that's what I wanted.

00:19:32.577 --> 00:19:34.137
Is that him?

00:19:36.337 --> 00:19:39.377
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?

00:19:40.897 --> 00:19:41.897
Of course.

00:19:42.737 --> 00:19:44.737
I see Nakia is back.

00:19:46.217 --> 00:19:47.417
You guys going to work it out?

00:19:53.737 --> 00:19:54.817
T'Challa...

00:19:55.537 --> 00:19:57.057
what's wrong?

00:19:57.257 --> 00:19:58.817
Nakia thinks we
should be doing more.

00:19:58.977 --> 00:19:59.977
More, like what?

00:20:00.137 --> 00:20:02.417
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.457
You let the refugees in...

00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:07.097
they bring their
problems with them.

00:20:07.257 --> 00:20:09.537
And then Wakanda is
like everywhere else.

00:20:11.497 --> 00:20:14.257
Now if you said you
wanted me and my men...

00:20:15.217 --> 00:20:16.937
to go out there and
clean up the world,

00:20:17.017 --> 00:20:18.617
then I'll be all for it.

00:20:19.057 --> 00:20:21.017
But waging war
on other countries

00:20:21.097 --> 00:20:22.697
has never been our way.

00:20:27.417 --> 00:20:28.457
You, too, huh?

00:20:28.617 --> 00:20:30.257
Bast! We're in trouble.

00:20:33.257 --> 00:20:34.417
<i>My King.</i>

00:20:35.337 --> 00:20:36.297
<i>My love.</i>

00:20:36.497 --> 00:20:39.897
<i>You will never guess who
just popped up on our radar.</i>

00:20:43.697 --> 00:20:45.497
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...

00:20:45.657 --> 00:20:48.377
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

00:20:49.657 --> 00:20:52.657
We have learned Ulysses Klaue...

00:20:52.857 --> 00:20:55.657
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...

00:20:55.857 --> 00:20:57.177
in South Korea...

00:20:57.337 --> 00:20:58.777
tomorrow night.

00:21:00.457 --> 00:21:04.337
Klaue has escaped our
pursuits for almost 30 years.

00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:08.777
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.

00:21:08.937 --> 00:21:12.017
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

00:21:12.177 --> 00:21:16.817
Wakanda does not
need a warrior right now.

00:21:17.257 --> 00:21:18.217
We need a king.

00:21:18.417 --> 00:21:21.017
My parents were
killed when he attacked.

00:21:22.057 --> 00:21:23.897
Not a day goes by
when I do not think

00:21:23.977 --> 00:21:26.057
about what Klaue took from us.

00:21:27.697 --> 00:21:28.697
From me.

00:21:29.057 --> 00:21:31.817
It's too great an
opportunity to pass.

00:21:32.017 --> 00:21:33.137
Take me with you.

00:21:33.217 --> 00:21:35.217
We'll take him down
together, side by side.

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:38.417
I need you here
protecting the border.

00:21:38.577 --> 00:21:39.857
Then I ask...

00:21:40.017 --> 00:21:42.137
you kill him where he stands...

00:21:42.297 --> 00:21:44.377
or you bring him back to us.

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:46.697
You have my word.

00:21:48.417 --> 00:21:50.577
I will bring him back.

00:21:52.017 --> 00:21:54.057
We will proceed
with the mission.

00:22:39.762 --> 00:22:40.762
My King!

00:22:40.922 --> 00:22:42.642
Stop it. Stop it.

00:22:45.402 --> 00:22:47.842
I've already sent a car
ahead to Busan for you.

00:22:48.442 --> 00:22:50.322
Who are you taking
with you to Korea?

00:22:50.762 --> 00:22:51.842
Okoye.

00:22:52.522 --> 00:22:54.442
And Nakia as well.

00:22:56.322 --> 00:23:00.082
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?

00:23:00.562 --> 00:23:01.642
Yes.

00:23:02.802 --> 00:23:03.842
We'll be fine.

00:23:03.922 --> 00:23:05.842
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.

00:23:06.002 --> 00:23:07.162
Yes!

00:23:07.362 --> 00:23:09.722
I have great things
to show you, Brother.

00:23:09.882 --> 00:23:12.282
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

00:23:13.082 --> 00:23:14.762
Unlimited range,

00:23:14.842 --> 00:23:17.602
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.

00:23:17.762 --> 00:23:19.122
Check these out.

00:23:20.442 --> 00:23:23.402
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:26.362
Updated to interface
directly with my sand table.

00:23:29.416 --> 00:23:30.736
If you're going
to take on Klaue...

00:23:30.896 --> 00:23:35.096
you'll need the best the
design group has to offer.

00:23:35.256 --> 00:23:36.376
Exhibit A.

00:23:36.536 --> 00:23:38.096
- My design.
- Old tech.

00:23:38.256 --> 00:23:40.536
Old? Functional, but old.

00:23:40.696 --> 00:23:42.376
"Hey, people are shooting at me.

00:23:42.456 --> 00:23:44.416
"Wait, let me put on my helmet."

00:23:44.576 --> 00:23:46.176
Enough.

00:23:47.256 --> 00:23:49.216
Now, look at these.

00:23:51.976 --> 00:23:53.176
Do you like that one?

00:23:53.336 --> 00:23:54.616
Tempting.

00:23:55.496 --> 00:23:57.856
But the idea is
to not be noticed.

00:23:59.696 --> 00:24:00.696
This one.

00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:09.376
Now tell it to go on.

00:24:14.696 --> 00:24:15.896
Ooh!

00:24:16.816 --> 00:24:20.136
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

00:24:21.016 --> 00:24:22.456
Strike it.

00:24:23.056 --> 00:24:24.616
Anywhere? Mmm-hmm.

00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:29.736
Not that hard, genius!

00:24:29.936 --> 00:24:32.136
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

00:24:32.296 --> 00:24:33.576
I invite you to my lab,

00:24:33.656 --> 00:24:35.136
and you just kick things around?

00:24:35.296 --> 00:24:38.016
Well, maybe you should
make it a little stronger.

00:24:38.096 --> 00:24:39.136
Hey.

00:24:39.216 --> 00:24:40.776
Wait a minute.

00:24:40.936 --> 00:24:43.656
The nanites absorb
the kinetic energy...

00:24:43.816 --> 00:24:46.216
and hold it in place
for redistribution.

00:24:46.376 --> 00:24:47.736
Very nice.

00:24:47.856 --> 00:24:50.536
Strike it again
in the same spot.

00:24:53.176 --> 00:24:54.696
You're recording?

00:24:55.296 --> 00:24:57.016
For research purposes.

00:25:04.496 --> 00:25:05.896
Delete that footage.

00:25:06.085 --> 00:25:07.647
I swear I left him right here.

00:25:07.882 --> 00:25:08.966
Right here on the sidewalk,

00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:10.342
or right there where the
building is being demolished?

00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:11.677
Great planning.

00:25:12.052 --> 00:25:13.095
How was I supposed to know?

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.430
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:16.807
No? Then why do
you dress like one?

00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:19.185
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.

00:25:19.476 --> 00:25:20.811
I saw you die.

00:25:20.895 --> 00:25:22.605
I mourned you, I cried for you.

00:25:22.813 --> 00:25:23.981
I'm honored.

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:25.357
Ask him.

00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:27.026
Hi. Would you mind
taking a picture with us?

00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:29.403
Oh, sure.

00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:31.030
Start figuring out where he is.

00:25:31.989 --> 00:25:33.032
Oh, my God.

00:25:33.115 --> 00:25:34.200
Sorry to hear that
Jane dumped you.

00:25:35.326 --> 00:25:36.952
She didn't dump me, you know.

00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:39.288
I dumped her.
It was a mutual dumping.

00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:43.125
What's this? What are you doing?

00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:44.460
This isn't me.

00:25:49.173 --> 00:25:50.174
Loki.

00:26:14.953 --> 00:26:16.871
Thor Odinson.

00:26:27.465 --> 00:26:28.967
God of Thunder.

00:26:30.093 --> 00:26:31.553
You can put down the umbrella.

00:26:49.404 --> 00:26:51.364
So, Earth has, uh, wizards now?

00:26:57.495 --> 00:26:58.663
The preferred term is

00:26:58.747 --> 00:27:00.457
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.

00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:03.126
All right, wizard.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.713
Who are you? Why should I care?

00:27:05.045 --> 00:27:06.838
My name is Doctor
Stephen Strange,

00:27:06.921 --> 00:27:08.882
and I have some
questions for you.

00:27:09.582 --> 00:27:10.583
Take a seat.

00:27:15.096 --> 00:27:16.097
Tea?

00:27:18.892 --> 00:27:19.893
I don't drink tea.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.311
What do you drink?

00:27:21.686 --> 00:27:22.771
Not tea.

00:27:26.107 --> 00:27:27.859
So, I keep a watch list

00:27:27.984 --> 00:27:29.736
of individuals and
beings from other realms...

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.613
that may be a
threat to this world.

00:27:31.696 --> 00:27:35.283
Your adopted brother,
Loki, is one of those beings.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.952
He's a worthy inclusion. Hmm.

00:27:39.954 --> 00:27:41.372
Then why bring him here?

00:27:41.915 --> 00:27:43.208
We're looking for my father.

00:27:43.625 --> 00:27:46.711
So, if I were to tell
you where Odin was...

00:27:47.212 --> 00:27:49.380
all parties concerned would
promptly return to Asgard?

00:27:49.756 --> 00:27:50.757
Promptly.

00:27:50.924 --> 00:27:52.133
Great! Then I'll help you.

00:27:52.634 --> 00:27:54.511
If you knew where he
was, why didn't you call me?

00:27:55.303 --> 00:27:56.429
I have to tell you,
he was adamant

00:27:56.513 --> 00:27:57.514
that he not be disturbed.

00:27:57.806 --> 00:27:59.724
Your father said he had
chosen to remain in exile.

00:28:01.059 --> 00:28:03.978
- Hmm.
- And you don't have a phone.

00:28:04.562 --> 00:28:06.064
No, I don't have a phone...

00:28:06.356 --> 00:28:07.982
but you could have
sent an electronic letter.

00:28:08.066 --> 00:28:09.150
It's called an email.

00:28:09.275 --> 00:28:10.902
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?

00:28:11.402 --> 00:28:13.154
- Uh-huh.
- Anyway,

00:28:13.238 --> 00:28:14.823
my father is no longer in exile.

00:28:15.115 --> 00:28:16.658
So if you could
tell me where he is,

00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:17.742
I can take him home.

00:28:18.034 --> 00:28:19.786
Gladly. He's in Norway.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.956
I'm just seeing
whether this incantation

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:26.042
requires any
Asgardian modifications.

00:28:26.709 --> 00:28:27.752
Nope.

00:28:28.795 --> 00:28:29.796
Oh, we don't need that.

00:28:35.844 --> 00:28:37.929
Will you stop doing that?

00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:42.142
I need just one
strand of your hair.

00:28:42.392 --> 00:28:43.393
Let me explain something.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.979
My hair is not to
be meddled with.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:54.988
We could have just walked.

00:28:57.991 --> 00:28:59.576
He's waiting for you.

00:28:59.868 --> 00:29:00.952
All right.

00:29:01.244 --> 00:29:02.495
Don't forget your umbrella.

00:29:02.871 --> 00:29:03.913
Oh, yes.

00:29:11.713 --> 00:29:12.714
Sorry.

00:29:15.425 --> 00:29:16.968
There we go.

00:29:17.969 --> 00:29:19.971
I suppose I'll need
my brother back.

00:29:20.597 --> 00:29:21.806
Oh, yeah. Right.

00:29:27.353 --> 00:29:30.356
I have been falling
for 30 minutes!

00:29:31.357 --> 00:29:32.525
You can handle him from here.

00:29:33.276 --> 00:29:34.277
Yes. Of course.

00:29:34.402 --> 00:29:35.695
Thank you very
much for your help.

00:29:35.945 --> 00:29:36.946
Good luck.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.990
Handle me? Who are you?

00:29:39.741 --> 00:29:40.742
Loki.

00:29:40.992 --> 00:29:42.160
You think you're
some kind of sorcerer?

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:43.953
Don't think for one
minute, you second-rate...

00:29:44.245 --> 00:29:45.246
Bye-bye.

00:30:06.984 --> 00:30:07.985
Father?

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.281
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

00:30:17.703 --> 00:30:19.121
Father, it's us.

00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:24.042
My sons.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.336
I've been waiting for you.

00:30:26.837 --> 00:30:28.130
I know. We've come
to take you home.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.090
Home, yes.

00:30:32.009 --> 00:30:34.052
Your mother, she calls me.

00:30:36.597 --> 00:30:37.598
Do you hear it?

00:30:39.725 --> 00:30:41.268
Loki, lift your magic.

00:30:43.937 --> 00:30:46.440
Took me quite a while to
break free from your spell.

00:30:46.732 --> 00:30:48.108
Frigga would have been proud.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.902
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.

00:30:57.784 --> 00:30:59.286
I know that we failed you.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.746
But we can make this right.

00:31:01.496 --> 00:31:02.706
I failed you.

00:31:03.749 --> 00:31:06.335
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

00:31:06.752 --> 00:31:09.296
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

00:31:10.088 --> 00:31:11.089
No.

00:31:11.673 --> 00:31:13.634
It has already begun.
She's coming.

00:31:15.052 --> 00:31:17.012
My life was all
that held her back.

00:31:17.095 --> 00:31:18.096
But my time has come.

00:31:21.391 --> 00:31:22.768
I cannot keep her
away any longer.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.728
Father, who are
you talking about?

00:31:25.646 --> 00:31:28.398
Goddess of Death. Hela.

00:31:29.566 --> 00:31:30.984
My firstborn.

00:31:32.194 --> 00:31:33.195
Your sister.

00:31:36.323 --> 00:31:37.949
Your what?

00:31:40.535 --> 00:31:43.246
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

00:31:44.539 --> 00:31:47.584
I couldn't stop her,
so I imprisoned her.

00:31:47.668 --> 00:31:48.752
Locked her away.

00:31:50.003 --> 00:31:53.006
She draws her
strength from Asgard...

00:31:54.341 --> 00:31:57.844
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.

00:31:58.553 --> 00:31:59.596
Whatever she is, we
can stop her together.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.681
We can face her together.

00:32:00.931 --> 00:32:01.932
No, we won't.

00:32:03.225 --> 00:32:05.060
I'm on a different path now.

00:32:05.394 --> 00:32:06.687
This you must face alone.

00:32:09.356 --> 00:32:10.816
I love you, my sons.

00:32:13.652 --> 00:32:15.028
Look at that.

00:32:19.241 --> 00:32:20.784
Remember this place.

00:32:22.285 --> 00:32:23.662
Home.

00:33:03.618 --> 00:33:04.661
Brother.

00:33:12.502 --> 00:33:15.088
This was your doing.

00:33:57.672 --> 00:33:58.882
So he's gone.

00:34:02.886 --> 00:34:05.096
That's a shame.
I would've liked to have seen that.

00:34:05.597 --> 00:34:07.015
You must be Hela.

00:34:08.683 --> 00:34:09.935
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

00:34:10.352 --> 00:34:13.605
Really? You don't look like him.

00:34:14.147 --> 00:34:15.774
Perhaps we can come
to an arrangement.

00:34:16.191 --> 00:34:17.818
You sound like him.

00:34:19.903 --> 00:34:20.904
Kneel.

00:34:21.321 --> 00:34:22.405
Beg your pardon?

00:34:26.827 --> 00:34:28.245
Kneel.

00:34:31.748 --> 00:34:33.333
Before your queen.

00:34:34.751 --> 00:34:36.002
I don't think so.

00:34:46.721 --> 00:34:48.723
It's not possible.

00:34:49.891 --> 00:34:53.436
Darling, you have no
idea what's possible.

00:35:13.748 --> 00:35:14.749
Bring us back!

00:35:14.833 --> 00:35:15.834
No!

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.011
Loki!

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.900
This way.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.500
Bast willing, this
will go quickly...

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.660
and I can get this
ridiculous thing off my head.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.060
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.900
What? It's a disgrace.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.740
Spread out.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.300
The buyer is
likely already here.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.820
The woman outside.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.980
What trouble was
she referring to?

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.860
Ah... I got into a disagreement

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.780
with some ivory traders.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.980
Made a bit of a mess. Hmm.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.220
And will there be
any trouble tonight,

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.220
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.620
Depends...

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.980
on how quickly we
finish the mission.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.980
<i>Can we please focus?</i>

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.020
Thank you.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.580
Eyes up. Americans.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.380
I count three.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:31.780
Five.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.260
How could you miss
Greased Lightning

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.620
there behind you?

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.900
Six.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:39.500
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.260
It just got a little
more complicated.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.700
Agent Ross.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:47.980
Your Highness.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.060
You are buying from Klaue.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.780
What I'm doing or not doing...

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.380
on behalf of the U.S. government

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.660
is none of your concern.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.500
Now, whatever the
hell you're up to...

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.740
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.180
I gave you Zemo.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.740
Didn't I keep it under wraps...

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.500
that the king of a
third world country

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.540
runs around in a
bulletproof cat suit?

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.100
I'd say we were even.

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.860
You really need to leave, now.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.820
Klaue is leaving out
that door with me.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.500
You've been warned.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:20.460
Three, craps.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.340
Hey, you won!

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.220
You know what?

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.420
I think I'll just take these...

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.260
bring them over here

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.700
and hold on for safekeeping.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.420
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.300
He cannot leave with Klaue.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.820
All right.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.340
Vibranium from the
attack on Sokovia

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.420
links back to a person...

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.700
that I'm not actually saying

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:46.780
I'm here to make a deal with...

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.340
but that deal will
not be called off.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.780
When the dust settles,

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.380
you and me can
work something out.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.420
I'm not here to make a deal.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.380
Klaue, plus eight!

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.660
General.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.740
In position to secure our exit.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.900
And the vibranium?

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.660
I don't see it yet.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.420
<i>I thought there were no
weapons allowed in here.</i>

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:34.340
There's not supposed to be.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.900
Somebody did not get the memo.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.380
Definitely armed.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.100
Well, that is quite
the entourage.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:43.420
You got a mixtape coming out?

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.220
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Actually, there is one.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.300
I'll send you the
SoundCloud link, if you like.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.780
Hey, Dave, can you
get the link to the tape?

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.540
Please, don't make
me listen to your music.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.460
I just meant you got a
lot of people with you.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.020
You think they're for you?

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.340
Don't worry.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.380
I can do a deal with
you all by myself,

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.620
thank you very much.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.500
<i>Six more. It's a setup.</i>

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.740
You got the diamonds?

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.220
Okay. That's enough.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.740
- We need to move on Klaue.
<i>- Stand down.</i>

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.820
We can't afford a shootout.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.980
Vibranium?

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.460
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.100
but I thought I'd save
myself some money.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.220
It's now or never.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.780
Hey!

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.060
Wakandans! They're here!

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.100
- Get outta here!
- Kill 'em all!

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.340
Diamonds, quick!

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.060
You know, you look
just like your old man.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.900
I made it rain!

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.700
Let's get out of here, boss!

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.380
That was awesome!
That was awesome!

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:35.100
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.500
Do we just leave him?
He'll catch up.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:48.860
Shuri!

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:53.460
Yes!

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.020
<i>Remote driving system activated.</i>

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.540
Wait!
Which side of the road is it?

00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.740
<i>For Bast's sake!</i>

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.260
<i>Just drive!</i> Okay, calm down!

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.220
Whoo! Let's go!

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.620
Put some music on.
What do you think this is, a funeral?

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.700
Which one is he in now?

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.380
Hey, split up!

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.700
They're trying to lose us.
I'll take the right.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.540
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:47.820
We're not going to make it!

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.540
Keep going!

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.660
Whoo! Brother!

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.660
Hey, what was that?

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.820
Don't worry about it.
You're doing great.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.340
Guns.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.900
So primitive!

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.900
It's a vibranium
car, you idiots!

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:30.140
The bullets won't penetrate!

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.380
What are you doing?

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:34.780
Just drive.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.860
Whoo! Shit!

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.860
Hey, look at your suit.

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.140
You've been taking bullets,

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.100
charging it up
with kinetic energy.

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.180
Pull around the truck.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.220
Where'd he go?

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.980
You show-off.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:33.260
There he is!

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.660
Hold tight!

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.620
All right. Let's have some fun!

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:10.980
Hop in.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.860
Put that spear in the trunk.

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.220
Faster, Shuri.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.020
I'm going as fast as I can!

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:24.860
Take a right! Take a right!

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.620
No, no, no!

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.100
Brother!

00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:58.660
Klaue!

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.420
Did you think we would forget?

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.380
Look at me, murderer!

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:15.820
Where did you get this weapon?

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:18.660
You savages didn't deserve it.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.780
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.060
Every breath you
take is mercy from me.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.060
Come on. Guys. Let's go, huh?

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.140
Yeah.

00:48:56.287 --> 00:48:57.663
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?

00:49:03.085 --> 00:49:04.128
I'm Hela.

00:49:06.464 --> 00:49:08.007
I'm just a janitor.

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:12.595
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

00:49:15.681 --> 00:49:17.349
How would you like a job?

00:51:28.856 --> 00:51:30.316
Are you a fighter?

00:51:31.233 --> 00:51:32.484
Or are you food?

00:51:33.277 --> 00:51:34.653
I'm just passing through.

00:51:35.362 --> 00:51:36.655
It is food.

00:51:37.031 --> 00:51:38.032
On your knees.

00:52:20.741 --> 00:52:22.117
He's mine.

00:52:31.502 --> 00:52:32.503
Wait!

00:52:41.553 --> 00:52:42.554
Wait!

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:45.891
He's mine.

00:52:46.141 --> 00:52:49.228
So if you want him,
you go through me.

00:52:49.603 --> 00:52:50.854
But we've already got him.

00:52:52.731 --> 00:52:55.442
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.

00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:57.444
More food.

00:53:32.982 --> 00:53:35.360
Thank you.

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.520
Hello.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.160
I can see you!
I can. I can see you.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.120
So this is a big mess, huh?

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.682
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.

00:54:27.799 --> 00:54:29.479
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.440
After your questioning,

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.480
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:49.160
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.120
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.960
Listen, I'm doing
you guys a favor

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.640
by letting you even be in here.

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.640
Does she speak English?

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.720
When she wants to.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.600
Huh.

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:10.720
I'm going in.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.000
When I'm done, you guys are up.

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.960
Agent Ross. Yeah?

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.400
I do appreciate
your help in Busan.

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.160
You see that?

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.920
It's called diplomacy.

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.040
You're welcome.

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.320
Okoye.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.520
Play nice.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.760
Americans.

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.720
You know, you really
shouldn't trust the Wakandans.

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.200
I'm much more your speed.

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.200
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.840
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.200
Where'd you get that?

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.080
It's an old mining tool that I
made some adjustments to.

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.600
But I can get you
one, if you like.

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.640
Why don't you give me
the name of your supplier,

00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.800
and I'll ask them.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.400
He's right outside.

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.160
Why don't you ask him yourself?

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.800
What? T'Challa?

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.280
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.440
Bingo.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.800
What do you actually
know about Wakanda?

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.200
Um...

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.480
Shepherds,
textiles, cool outfits.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.920
<i>It's all a front.</i>

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.120
<i>Explorers searched
for it for centuries.</i>

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.760
<i>El Dorado, the Golden City.</i>

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.280
<i>They thought they could
find it in South America...</i>

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.320
but it was in Africa
the whole time.

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.280
A technological marvel.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.840
All because it was
built on a mound

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.000
of the most valuable
metal known to man.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.280
<i>Isipho,</i> they call it.
The gift.

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.000
Vibranium.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.320
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.720
It's not just a metal.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.360
They sew it into their clothes.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.320
It powers their
city, their tech...

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.760
their weapons.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.520
Weapons?

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.680
Yeah.

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.160
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.640
That's a nice fairy tale,

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.640
but Wakanda is a
third world country...

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.280
and you stole all
their vibranium.

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.720
I stole...

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.360
All of it?

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.240
I took a tiny piece of it.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.120
They have a mountain full of it.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.480
<i>They've been mining it
for thousands of years...</i>

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:21.920
<i>and they still haven't
scratched the surface.</i>

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.080
<i>I'm the only
outsider who's seen it</i>

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.760
<i>and got out of there alive.</i>

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.600
<i>If you don't believe me,</i>

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.880
<i>you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.</i>

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.800
What his claws are made of.

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.480
Your father told the UN...

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.560
that Klaue stole all
the vibranium you had.

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.280
But now he's telling
me you have more.

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.880
And you believe the word

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.480
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.240
How much more are you hiding?

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:53.840
Get down!

00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.760
Stand down!

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.320
Cover!

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:05.440
Grenade!

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.320
I see you took your
time, didn't you?

00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.040
Nakia.

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.600
He just jumped in front of me.

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.080
I don't think he'll
make it here.

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.560
It hit his spine.

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.880
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.160
This will stabilize him for now.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.680
Give him to us.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.120
We can save him.

01:00:26.599 --> 01:00:28.319
Let's get going, boss.

01:00:29.919 --> 01:00:31.719
You always sell to the CIA?

01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:33.799
I sell to the highest bidder.

01:00:33.959 --> 01:00:36.079
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...

01:00:36.239 --> 01:00:37.559
and I lay low for a bit,

01:00:37.639 --> 01:00:39.039
I'll make sure both
you guys get paid.

01:00:39.399 --> 01:00:40.919
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.

01:00:40.999 --> 01:00:41.999
I know you good for it.

01:00:42.159 --> 01:00:44.759
On our way back, just
drop us off in Wakanda.

01:00:44.839 --> 01:00:45.839
You don't want to go there, boy.

01:00:45.919 --> 01:00:46.919
Yeah, I do.

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:50.879
Drop it!

01:00:51.359 --> 01:00:53.519
Or your little Bonnie
and Clyde routine

01:00:53.599 --> 01:00:54.619
ends today.

01:00:54.812 --> 01:00:56.212
Put your gun down now!

01:00:56.599 --> 01:00:58.199
I'm sorry.

01:00:58.359 --> 01:01:00.599
Sorry, Erik. It's gonna be okay.

01:01:28.425 --> 01:01:30.745
You really want
to go to Wakanda?

01:01:32.098 --> 01:01:33.538
They're savages.

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:37.790
This is what they
do to people like us.

01:01:38.075 --> 01:01:39.235
I ain't worried about no brand.

01:01:39.552 --> 01:01:41.032
Check these out.

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:43.540
Each one is for a kill.

01:01:44.122 --> 01:01:46.802
You can scar yourself
as much as you'd like.

01:01:46.986 --> 01:01:49.786
To them, you'll
just be an outsider.

01:01:49.883 --> 01:01:52.163
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.

01:01:58.174 --> 01:02:02.229
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.
