WEBVTT

00:00:34.198 --> 00:00:35.199
Hey, Nat!

00:01:04.645 --> 00:01:06.272
We're both upside down.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.524
And I bet you're
gonna fall down first.

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:10.234
No, you will.

00:01:10.735 --> 00:01:13.029
You can't hold it much longer.

00:01:15.823 --> 00:01:17.450
Told you you'd fall down first.

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:20.912
I told you! I told you!

00:01:23.498 --> 00:01:24.540
Told you so!

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:28.002
Mommy!

00:01:35.926 --> 00:01:37.095
What happened?

00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:40.014
She fell on her knee.

00:01:40.098 --> 00:01:42.141
- Oh, you bump your knee?
- Mmm-hmm.

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:43.434
Oh...

00:01:45.144 --> 00:01:48.397
Kiss it better. There we go.

00:01:49.357 --> 00:01:51.526
Oh, come on, little one.

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:53.319
Get up. You're okay.

00:01:54.028 --> 00:01:56.489
Come on. You're a brave girl.

00:01:56.948 --> 00:01:59.200
Your pain only
makes you stronger.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.786
- Right, you?
- Yeah.

00:02:01.953 --> 00:02:02.954
- Yeah?
- Look!

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.081
Forest stars.

00:02:05.248 --> 00:02:06.249
Yeah. You know what?

00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:10.169
Those are actually part
of the Lampyridae family.

00:02:10.336 --> 00:02:13.881
And the glow, the
glow that you see,

00:02:14.048 --> 00:02:17.510
that comes from a
chemical reaction called...

00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:20.221
bioluminescence.

00:02:20.596 --> 00:02:22.306
Come on, time for dinner.

00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:24.684
Bio-goomin-feasants?

00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:27.228
"Bio-goomin-feasants."
That's right.

00:02:28.354 --> 00:02:30.106
Dinner!

00:02:30.273 --> 00:02:32.442
Come on, dinner, big girl!

00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:52.888
Oh, shit.

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.694
Eyes on target.
Waiting for the package.

00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:42.199
I have sights on collateral one.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.663
Firing in place of three.

00:03:48.455 --> 00:03:50.751
<i>Five, four...</i>

00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:53.544
<i>She made us.
Target deployed smoke.</i>

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.255
She's on foot with the package.
Stay high. I'm going to ground.

00:05:10.996 --> 00:05:12.581
Oksana.

00:05:15.042 --> 00:05:16.043
Oh, no.

00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:18.003
What did I do?

00:05:18.462 --> 00:05:19.963
Free the others.

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.558
Yelena, we need a status report.

00:05:35.437 --> 00:05:37.940
<i>Yelena, we need a status report.</i>

00:05:45.072 --> 00:05:47.115
Converge on team leader.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.752
Okay.

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.670
Green beans are
my favorite vegetable.

00:05:57.297 --> 00:05:58.715
Dad's home!

00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:03.011
Hey, Dad.

00:06:03.553 --> 00:06:04.596
Hey, baby.

00:06:15.398 --> 00:06:16.691
Everything okay?

00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:21.947
How was everybody's day?

00:06:22.113 --> 00:06:24.115
Mommy taught me about lamp bugs.

00:06:24.282 --> 00:06:27.118
- Lamp bugs.
- And I fell and hurt my knee,

00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:29.829
- but it doesn't hurt anymore.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:06:29.913 --> 00:06:31.998
And we also saw
fireflies in the backyard.

00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:33.166
That was my favorite part

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.292
- of the whole day.
- No.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:36.753
Yelena, we see
fireflies every year.

00:06:36.836 --> 00:06:37.837
How long do we have?

00:06:37.921 --> 00:06:40.507
I don't know.
Like, an hour, maybe.

00:06:43.217 --> 00:06:45.053
I don't wanna go.

00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:49.224
Don't say that.

00:06:53.353 --> 00:06:54.437
Girls...

00:06:55.814 --> 00:06:59.067
you remember when I told you that one
day we would have that big adventure?

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.947
- Today's the day.
- Yay!

00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:08.910
All right, let's go.

00:07:16.126 --> 00:07:17.669
I'm sorry.

00:07:24.217 --> 00:07:25.802
- Come on, we gotta hurry.
- Thank you.

00:07:25.886 --> 00:07:27.053
- I don't have my shoes.
- Thank you, baby.

00:07:27.137 --> 00:07:28.847
That's okay.
You don't need your shoes.

00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:31.266
- But I'm still hungry.
- Yeah? Guess what?

00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:32.809
I got Fruit Roll-Ups in the car.

00:07:42.277 --> 00:07:44.821
No, leave it, leave it, leave it.
Go wait in the car.

00:07:52.662 --> 00:07:53.663
- You have it?
- Yeah.

00:07:53.747 --> 00:07:55.874
- It's the only copy?
- It's the only one not on fire.

00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:08.345
Where are we going?

00:08:09.304 --> 00:08:10.305
Home.

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:12.766
Mommy, you're silly.

00:08:12.933 --> 00:08:14.517
We just left home.

00:09:15.062 --> 00:09:16.688
I know you're out there.

00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:20.484
I know you know I'm out here.

00:09:26.698 --> 00:09:29.785
Then why are you skulking
about like it's a minefield?

00:09:29.952 --> 00:09:31.912
'Cause I don't know
if I can trust you.

00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:34.998
Funny, I was going
to say the same thing.

00:09:38.252 --> 00:09:40.212
So, we gonna talk
like grown-ups?

00:09:42.673 --> 00:09:43.924
Is that what we are?

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:55.978
Put it down before I make you.

00:09:56.145 --> 00:09:57.229
You put yours down.

00:09:58.188 --> 00:10:00.566
Watch your step.

00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:22.921
Stay down. Stay down.

00:10:23.297 --> 00:10:25.507
Stay down.

00:11:20.771 --> 00:11:23.107
Stop.

00:12:13.828 --> 00:12:17.290
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

00:12:17.874 --> 00:12:19.542
I've got something special.

00:12:19.834 --> 00:12:22.045
Hey! Where are you taking me?

00:12:23.588 --> 00:12:24.714
Answer me!

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.174
Hey!

00:12:26.633 --> 00:12:29.010
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.

00:12:30.178 --> 00:12:32.263
Many apologies, your majesty.

00:13:03.047 --> 00:13:05.299
<i>Fear not, for you are found.</i>

00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:09.345
<i>You are home, and
there is no going back.</i>

00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:14.767
<i>No one leaves this place.</i>

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.644
<i>But what is this place?</i>

00:13:16.852 --> 00:13:19.939
<i>The answer is Sakaar.</i>

00:13:21.982 --> 00:13:24.068
<i>Surrounded by cosmic gateways...</i>

00:13:24.276 --> 00:13:26.987
<i>Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.</i>

00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:28.948
<i>It is the collection point</i>

00:13:29.031 --> 00:13:30.699
<i>for all lost and
unloved things...</i>

00:13:31.033 --> 00:13:32.660
<i>like you.</i>

00:13:32.868 --> 00:13:35.496
<i>But here on Sakaar,
you are significant.</i>

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:37.206
<i>You are valuable.</i>

00:13:37.289 --> 00:13:38.916
<i>Here you are loved.</i>

00:13:38.999 --> 00:13:40.000
What the hell?

00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:43.170
<i>And no one loves you
more than the Grandmaster.</i>

00:13:43.462 --> 00:13:45.422
<i>He is the original,</i>

00:13:45.506 --> 00:13:47.549
<i>the first lost and
the first found...</i>

00:13:47.758 --> 00:13:48.842
<i>the creator of Sakaar...</i>

00:13:49.176 --> 00:13:52.221
<i>and father of the
Contest of Champions.</i>

00:13:52.554 --> 00:13:56.684
<i>Where once you were
nothing, now you are something.</i>

00:13:57.017 --> 00:14:00.062
<i>You are the property
of the Grandmaster.</i>

00:14:00.437 --> 00:14:01.772
<i>Congratulations!</i>

00:14:02.022 --> 00:14:05.359
<i>You will meet the
Grandmaster in 5 seconds.</i>

00:14:05.818 --> 00:14:07.069
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

00:14:08.988 --> 00:14:10.114
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

00:14:11.824 --> 00:14:15.035
<i>You are now meeting
the Grandmaster.</i>

00:14:24.086 --> 00:14:25.379
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.217
He's wonderful. It is a he?

00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:31.719
It is a he.

00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:32.803
Yeah.

00:14:33.012 --> 00:14:34.972
I love when you
come to visit, 142.

00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:36.640
You bring me the best stuff.

00:14:37.057 --> 00:14:38.726
Whenever we get
to talking, Topaz,

00:14:38.809 --> 00:14:40.519
about Scrapper 142...

00:14:40.728 --> 00:14:42.104
what do I always say?

00:14:42.187 --> 00:14:44.148
"She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."

00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:45.357
Trash.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.110
No, not trash.

00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:50.529
Were you waiting
just to call her that?

00:14:50.612 --> 00:14:51.989
It doesn't start with a "B."

00:14:52.281 --> 00:14:53.282
Booze hag.

00:14:56.076 --> 00:14:58.287
Uh, I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."

00:14:58.537 --> 00:14:59.663
'Cause I always
say you're the best.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.832
She brought me my
beloved champion, you know.

00:15:02.124 --> 00:15:03.834
You say that every
time she's here.

00:15:04.084 --> 00:15:05.085
What have you brought today?
Tell me.

00:15:05.586 --> 00:15:06.587
A contender.

00:15:06.795 --> 00:15:07.796
A what?

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.007
I need to go closer.
I want a closer look at this.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.134
Can you take us closer?
Thank you.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:25.731
Pay this lady.

00:15:25.898 --> 00:15:27.524
Just wait a damn minute.

00:15:27.816 --> 00:15:30.069
I'm not for sale.

00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:38.035
Man, he's a fighter.

00:15:38.243 --> 00:15:39.495
I take 10 million.

00:15:39.787 --> 00:15:40.788
Tell her she's dreaming.

00:15:40.996 --> 00:15:42.831
Oh, for heaven's
sakes, transfer the units.

00:15:49.963 --> 00:15:51.423
You'll pay for this.

00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:53.008
No, I got paid for this.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.386
Here's what I wanna know.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.181
Who are you?

00:15:59.264 --> 00:16:03.227
I am the God of Thunder.

00:16:03.977 --> 00:16:05.729
Wow.

00:16:06.605 --> 00:16:07.815
I didn't hear any thunder,

00:16:07.898 --> 00:16:09.942
but out of your fingers,
was that sparkles?

00:16:10.651 --> 00:16:12.486
We've located your cousin.

00:16:13.237 --> 00:16:14.571
Uh, oh, good!

00:16:14.822 --> 00:16:16.824
Yeah, come on.
I think you're gonna like this.

00:16:17.157 --> 00:16:18.158
There he is.

00:16:18.242 --> 00:16:19.326
Hey, cuz.

00:16:20.035 --> 00:16:22.204
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

00:16:22.371 --> 00:16:23.664
Hi.

00:16:23.956 --> 00:16:25.165
Hmm.

00:16:25.249 --> 00:16:26.375
So...

00:16:26.667 --> 00:16:27.668
Please.

00:16:28.377 --> 00:16:29.878
I'm sorry.

00:16:30.129 --> 00:16:31.171
Yeah.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.506
Carlo...

00:16:33.799 --> 00:16:34.883
I pardon you.

00:16:35.217 --> 00:16:36.426
Oh, thank you.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.511
Thank you.

00:16:37.928 --> 00:16:40.681
You're officially pardoned.
From life.

00:16:45.727 --> 00:16:47.729
Help me.

00:16:48.522 --> 00:16:51.024
Oh, my God!

00:16:51.567 --> 00:16:53.402
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!

00:16:54.194 --> 00:16:55.362
Wow.

00:16:55.904 --> 00:16:57.322
Oh, the smell.

00:16:57.865 --> 00:16:58.949
What does it smell like?

00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:01.410
Burnt toast.

00:17:01.618 --> 00:17:03.203
What happened to my manners?

00:17:03.579 --> 00:17:04.997
I haven't properly
introduced myself.

00:17:05.289 --> 00:17:07.082
Come on. Uh, follow me.

00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:09.501
My name is Grandmaster.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.503
I preside over a
little harlequinade

00:17:11.587 --> 00:17:13.005
called the Contest of Champions.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.673
People come from far and wide

00:17:14.756 --> 00:17:15.924
to unwillingly
participate in it.

00:17:16.341 --> 00:17:17.342
And you, my friend,

00:17:17.426 --> 00:17:18.927
might just be part
of the new cast.

00:17:19.094 --> 00:17:20.137
What do you say to that?

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.222
We're not friends and I don't
give a shit about your games.

00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:23.682
I'm going back to Asgard.

00:17:24.057 --> 00:17:26.143
Ass-gard.

00:17:26.935 --> 00:17:28.937
One, two, three, four.

00:17:30.606 --> 00:17:32.691
There was a wormhole in
space and time beneath me.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.028
At that moment, I let go.

00:17:36.278 --> 00:17:37.279
Loki?

00:17:38.739 --> 00:17:40.324
Loki! Loki!

00:17:40.574 --> 00:17:43.827
Over here. Over here.

00:17:44.077 --> 00:17:45.287
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!

00:17:47.289 --> 00:17:48.457
- What?
- You're alive?

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.209
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.501
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

00:17:51.585 --> 00:17:52.586
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:53.962
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.

00:17:54.338 --> 00:17:55.631
- Get me out of this one.
- I can't.

00:17:55.714 --> 00:17:57.049
- Get me out. What?
- I can't.

00:17:57.132 --> 00:17:58.133
I've made friends with this man.

00:17:58.217 --> 00:17:59.218
He's called the Grandmaster.

00:17:59.301 --> 00:18:00.427
- Oh, he's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.

00:18:00.719 --> 00:18:02.179
The Bifrost brought
me out here weeks ago.

00:18:02.471 --> 00:18:03.472
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.681
I just got here.

00:18:04.932 --> 00:18:05.933
What are you whispering about?

00:18:07.226 --> 00:18:08.852
Time works real different
around these parts.

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:12.064
On any other world, I'd
be, like, millions of years old.

00:18:12.356 --> 00:18:13.857
But here on Sakaar...

00:18:19.404 --> 00:18:21.949
In any case, you
know this, uh...

00:18:22.032 --> 00:18:23.367
You call yourself
Lord of Thunder?

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.827
God of Thunder. Tell him.

00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:27.704
I've never met
this man in my life.

00:18:27.996 --> 00:18:29.498
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.

00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:30.666
Is he any kind of a fighter?

00:18:31.041 --> 00:18:32.084
You take this thing

00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:33.168
out of my neck
and I'll show you.

00:18:33.418 --> 00:18:35.003
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

00:18:35.254 --> 00:18:37.130
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

00:18:37.422 --> 00:18:39.508
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

00:18:39.758 --> 00:18:40.842
Asgard.

00:18:40.926 --> 00:18:43.762
Any contender who
defeats my champion...

00:18:43.971 --> 00:18:45.681
their freedom they shall win.

00:18:45.973 --> 00:18:47.516
Fine. Then point me
in the direction

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:49.059
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

00:18:49.393 --> 00:18:51.812
That's what I call, contender.

00:18:52.062 --> 00:18:54.356
Direction would
be this way, Lord.

00:18:54.815 --> 00:18:56.024
Ah! Loki!

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.907
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

00:19:04.992 --> 00:19:06.702
Over here.

00:19:06.868 --> 00:19:08.370
The pile of rocks
waving at you. Here.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.081
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

00:19:11.331 --> 00:19:12.916
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.293
I'm kind of like
the leader in here.

00:19:14.584 --> 00:19:16.336
I'm made of rocks,
as you can see.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.879
But don't let that
intimidate you.

00:19:18.171 --> 00:19:19.339
You don't need to be afraid

00:19:19.423 --> 00:19:20.966
unless you're made of scissors.

00:19:21.174 --> 00:19:22.342
Just a little rock-paper-scissor

00:19:22.426 --> 00:19:23.427
joke for you.

00:19:23.719 --> 00:19:26.346
This is my very good
friend over here, Miek.

00:19:26.638 --> 00:19:29.266
He's an insect and
has knives for hands.

00:19:30.017 --> 00:19:31.310
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:34.146
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?

00:19:34.396 --> 00:19:36.106
Ah, well, I tried to
start a revolution,

00:19:36.189 --> 00:19:37.232
but didn't print
enough pamphlets.

00:19:37.524 --> 00:19:38.900
So hardly anyone turned up,

00:19:38.984 --> 00:19:41.570
except for my mum and
her boyfriend, who I hate.

00:19:41.903 --> 00:19:43.196
As punishment, I was forced

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.657
to be in here and
become a gladiator.

00:19:45.866 --> 00:19:47.159
Bit of a promotional
disaster, that one.

00:19:47.492 --> 00:19:50.078
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.371
I don't know if
you'd be interested

00:19:51.455 --> 00:19:52.497
in something like that.

00:19:52.581 --> 00:19:54.249
Do you reckon
you'd be interested?

00:19:56.543 --> 00:19:57.544
How did you...

00:19:57.794 --> 00:20:00.380
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

00:20:00.672 --> 00:20:03.717
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

00:20:04.051 --> 00:20:05.218
This doesn't make any sense.

00:20:05.302 --> 00:20:06.595
No, nothing makes
sense here, man.

00:20:06.845 --> 00:20:08.221
The only thing that
does make sense

00:20:08.305 --> 00:20:09.681
is that nothing makes sense.

00:20:10.015 --> 00:20:12.225
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

00:20:12.517 --> 00:20:13.518
Doug has.

00:20:13.685 --> 00:20:14.686
Doug!

00:20:14.936 --> 00:20:15.937
Our luck, Doug's dead.

00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:17.022
That's right.

00:20:17.189 --> 00:20:18.273
Everyone who fights

00:20:18.357 --> 00:20:19.441
the Grandmaster's
champion perishes.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.443
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

00:20:21.693 --> 00:20:24.237
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:26.323
Yeah, no, I just do
the smaller fights,

00:20:26.406 --> 00:20:28.241
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

00:20:28.533 --> 00:20:30.160
Wait.
You're not gonna face him, are you?

00:20:30.452 --> 00:20:31.745
Yes, I am.

00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:33.830
Gonna fight him, win,

00:20:33.914 --> 00:20:35.207
and get the hell
out of this place.

00:20:35.957 --> 00:20:37.709
That's exactly what
Doug used to say.

00:20:38.043 --> 00:20:39.753
See you later, new Doug.

00:20:40.592 --> 00:20:42.302
You had to come to
Budapest, didn't you?

00:20:43.428 --> 00:20:45.597
I came here because
I thought you wouldn't.

00:20:46.431 --> 00:20:49.476
But since you're here,
what bullet does that?

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.897
Not bullets. Arrows.

00:20:54.064 --> 00:20:55.148
Ah, right.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.485
If you didn't think I'd come
here, why'd you send me this?

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.528
You brought it back here?

00:21:02.989 --> 00:21:05.575
I'm not here trying to be your friend,
but you need to tell me what that is.

00:21:05.742 --> 00:21:07.160
It's a synthetic gas.

00:21:07.327 --> 00:21:09.704
The counteragent to
chemical subjugation.

00:21:09.871 --> 00:21:11.581
The gas immunizes the
brain's neuropathways

00:21:11.665 --> 00:21:12.666
from external manipulation.

00:21:12.832 --> 00:21:14.125
Maybe in English next time?

00:21:18.296 --> 00:21:20.756
Why don't you take it to one
of your super-scientist friends?

00:21:20.924 --> 00:21:22.050
They can explain it to you.

00:21:22.216 --> 00:21:23.718
Tony Stark, maybe?

00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:26.388
Oh, yeah. We're not really
talking right now, so...

00:21:26.763 --> 00:21:28.515
Great. Perfect timing.

00:21:28.682 --> 00:21:30.767
Where's an Avenger
when you need one?

00:21:30.934 --> 00:21:31.935
I don't wanna be here.

00:21:32.102 --> 00:21:34.354
I'm on the run.
You could've gotten me killed.

00:21:34.521 --> 00:21:36.106
Well, what was I supposed to do?

00:21:36.189 --> 00:21:39.192
You're the only superhero
person that I know.

00:21:41.319 --> 00:21:43.154
That was the whole
reason I sent it to you.

00:21:46.323 --> 00:21:47.700
I kept checking the news,

00:21:47.867 --> 00:21:52.289
expecting to see Captain America
bringing down the Red Room.

00:21:56.459 --> 00:21:57.459
What?

00:21:58.878 --> 00:22:01.006
Taking down the Red Room?
What are you talking about?

00:22:01.172 --> 00:22:02.757
It's been gone for years.

00:22:03.717 --> 00:22:04.759
Dreykov's dead.

00:22:05.302 --> 00:22:06.303
I killed him.

00:22:06.469 --> 00:22:08.555
You don't actually
believe that, do you?

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.270
You really do believe that.

00:22:15.437 --> 00:22:16.855
Dreykov's dead.

00:22:17.022 --> 00:22:19.274
It took almost destroying the
entire city just to get to him.

00:22:19.441 --> 00:22:21.026
If you're so sure, then
tell me what happened.

00:22:21.192 --> 00:22:22.819
Tell me exactly.

00:22:23.778 --> 00:22:24.779
We rigged bombs.

00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:26.448
- Who's "we"?
- Clint Barton.

00:22:27.032 --> 00:22:29.659
Killing Dreykov was the final
step in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:22:31.828 --> 00:22:33.204
Simple as that?

00:22:35.624 --> 00:22:37.292
Yeah, sure, "simple."

00:22:37.876 --> 00:22:39.794
That's what I'd call
imploding a five-story building

00:22:39.961 --> 00:22:43.048
and then shooting it out with
the Hungarian Special Forces.

00:22:43.214 --> 00:22:46.259
Took 10 days in hiding before
we could even get out of Budapest.

00:22:46.885 --> 00:22:48.011
And you checked the body?

00:22:48.178 --> 00:22:49.763
Confirmed the kill?

00:22:53.266 --> 00:22:55.101
There was no body left to check.

00:22:57.145 --> 00:22:58.897
You're forgetting
Dreykov's daughter.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.833
Where are we trying to get?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.002
Motorbike!
East side of the building.

00:24:04.254 --> 00:24:05.297
They're going east, to the roof.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.423
Copy, in pursuit.

00:24:32.365 --> 00:24:34.409
I got you!

00:24:36.995 --> 00:24:39.122
No!

00:24:56.723 --> 00:24:58.892
Hey.

00:24:59.267 --> 00:25:01.102
Don't move. You're hurt.

00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:02.479
Let me help you.

00:25:16.964 --> 00:25:19.579
I don't wanna do this.

00:25:21.831 --> 00:25:23.875
- What are you doing?
- He's making me.

00:25:54.035 --> 00:25:55.953
Do you believe me now?

00:25:57.455 --> 00:25:58.873
How many others?

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.416
Enough.

00:26:11.106 --> 00:26:12.399
I want my song.

00:26:15.069 --> 00:26:17.863
<i>♪ Bye, bye, Miss American Pie</i>

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:23.035
<i>♪ Drove my Chevy to the
levee but the levee was dry</i>

00:26:23.452 --> 00:26:27.581
<i>♪ Them good old boys were
drinking whiskey and rye</i>

00:26:27.748 --> 00:26:32.002
<i>♪ Singing, "This'll be
the day that I die"</i>

00:26:32.836 --> 00:26:36.340
<i>♪ "This'll be the day that I die"</i>

00:27:05.703 --> 00:27:07.705
Come on, Yelena. Hurry up, baby.

00:27:07.871 --> 00:27:09.999
Let's go. Come on, Nat.
Hurry up. We gotta go.

00:27:10.165 --> 00:27:11.625
We gotta go.
Come on, you gotta run.

00:27:22.886 --> 00:27:23.887
Come on. Honey, honey.

00:27:24.013 --> 00:27:25.014
- Go with your mom. Go with your mom.
- Okay.

00:27:25.097 --> 00:27:26.557
- Nat, hurry up!
- I'm coming!

00:27:28.183 --> 00:27:29.810
Okay. Seat belts.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:33.731
Okay.

00:27:33.814 --> 00:27:34.815
Why isn't Dad in the plane?

00:27:34.898 --> 00:27:36.275
He's coming.
He's coming, baby. He's coming.

00:28:17.983 --> 00:28:19.276
Mom?

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.537
Mom!

00:28:33.082 --> 00:28:34.541
I need you up here.

00:28:36.627 --> 00:28:38.003
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.047
I need you to pull right.

00:28:44.134 --> 00:28:45.803
Mom, you've got blood on you.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:46.971
It's okay, baby.

00:29:06.407 --> 00:29:07.700
Hit the accelerator there.

00:29:17.418 --> 00:29:18.919
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

00:29:19.503 --> 00:29:22.548
You're gonna pull
back at 55 knots.

00:29:23.048 --> 00:29:24.049
Let's count together.

00:29:24.133 --> 00:29:26.677
45, 50...

00:29:40.274 --> 00:29:41.483
Pull back. You can do it!

00:29:42.318 --> 00:29:43.694
Pull back. All your strength.

00:30:03.215 --> 00:30:04.216
Odin...

00:30:04.508 --> 00:30:07.678
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla...

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.222
where the brave
shall live forever.

00:30:11.765 --> 00:30:14.017
Nor shall we
mourn but rejoice...

00:30:14.393 --> 00:30:15.644
for those that have died...

00:30:15.727 --> 00:30:17.020
the glorious death.

00:30:25.112 --> 00:30:26.405
Hurts, doesn't it?

00:30:26.697 --> 00:30:27.698
Being lied to.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.075
Being told you're one thing

00:30:30.158 --> 00:30:32.035
and then learning
it's all a fiction.

00:30:36.999 --> 00:30:38.875
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

00:30:39.167 --> 00:30:40.794
This place is disgusting.

00:30:43.797 --> 00:30:45.507
Does this mean you
don't want my help?

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:47.718
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
position with the Grandmaster.

00:30:47.884 --> 00:30:49.261
It took me time
to win his trust.

00:30:49.344 --> 00:30:50.804
He's a lunatic, but
he can be amenable.

00:30:51.138 --> 00:30:52.347
What I'm telling you is,

00:30:52.431 --> 00:30:54.224
you could join me at
the Grandmaster's side.

00:30:54.474 --> 00:30:55.475
Perhaps, in time,

00:30:55.559 --> 00:30:59.021
an accident befalls the
Grandmaster, and then...

00:31:05.068 --> 00:31:07.446
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

00:31:10.032 --> 00:31:12.617
Our sister destroyed your hammer

00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:14.077
like a piece of glass.

00:31:15.162 --> 00:31:16.830
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.

00:31:17.039 --> 00:31:18.332
You don't stand a chance.

00:31:18.498 --> 00:31:20.667
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

00:31:25.213 --> 00:31:26.214
Fine.

00:31:28.925 --> 00:31:31.386
I guess I'll just
have to go it alone.

00:31:32.304 --> 00:31:33.305
Like I've always done.

00:31:36.433 --> 00:31:37.601
Would you say something?

00:31:40.395 --> 00:31:41.813
Say something!

00:31:43.065 --> 00:31:45.150
What would you like me to say?

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:47.736
You faked your own death...

00:31:48.028 --> 00:31:50.530
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power...

00:31:50.781 --> 00:31:52.240
stranded him on Earth to die,

00:31:52.324 --> 00:31:53.950
releasing the Goddess of Death.

00:31:54.576 --> 00:31:55.744
Have I said enough or
would you like me to go back

00:31:55.827 --> 00:31:57.746
further than the past two days?

00:31:59.456 --> 00:32:00.832
You know, I haven't seen this

00:32:00.916 --> 00:32:02.959
beloved champion he talks of...

00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:05.128
but I've heard he is
astonishingly savage.

00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:08.507
I've placed a large wager
against you tomorrow.

00:32:09.883 --> 00:32:10.884
Don't let me down.

00:32:14.894 --> 00:32:16.348
Piss off, ghost!

00:32:18.934 --> 00:32:20.394
He's freaking gone.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.841
Oh, yuck!

00:32:29.966 --> 00:32:32.051
There's still someone's
hair and blood all over this.

00:32:32.343 --> 00:32:33.636
Guys, can you
clean up the weapons

00:32:33.719 --> 00:32:34.929
once you finish your fight?

00:32:35.096 --> 00:32:36.097
Disgusting slobs.

00:32:37.348 --> 00:32:38.766
Oh, Thor...

00:32:39.267 --> 00:32:41.060
wanna use a big wooden fork?

00:32:41.436 --> 00:32:42.437
No.

00:32:42.562 --> 00:32:43.729
Yeah, not really useful.

00:32:43.938 --> 00:32:45.648
Unless you're fighting
off three vampires

00:32:45.731 --> 00:32:47.316
that were huddled together.

00:32:48.317 --> 00:32:49.777
I really wish I had my hammer.

00:32:50.194 --> 00:32:51.195
Hammer?

00:32:51.404 --> 00:32:52.905
Quite unique.
It was made from this

00:32:52.989 --> 00:32:54.949
special metal from the
heart of a dying star.

00:32:55.533 --> 00:32:56.993
And when I spun
it really, really fast,

00:32:57.076 --> 00:32:58.578
it gave me the ability to fly.

00:32:58.703 --> 00:32:59.704
You rode a hammer?

00:32:59.954 --> 00:33:01.372
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:03.040
The hammer rode
you on your back?

00:33:03.207 --> 00:33:04.792
No. I used to
spin it really fast,

00:33:04.876 --> 00:33:06.461
and it would pull me off the...

00:33:06.544 --> 00:33:08.629
Oh, my God.
A hammer pulled you off?

00:33:08.713 --> 00:33:10.465
The ground. It would
pull me off the ground,

00:33:10.548 --> 00:33:12.341
up into the air,
and I would fly.

00:33:12.633 --> 00:33:13.634
Every time I threw it,

00:33:13.718 --> 00:33:15.511
it would always come back to me.

00:33:15.887 --> 00:33:17.013
Sounds like you
had a pretty special

00:33:17.096 --> 00:33:18.473
and intimate relationship
with this hammer...

00:33:18.556 --> 00:33:19.682
and that losing it

00:33:19.765 --> 00:33:21.559
was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

00:33:22.685 --> 00:33:24.770
That's a nice way of putting it.

00:33:26.439 --> 00:33:27.690
I said they're mine.

00:33:29.233 --> 00:33:31.110
See her, that's the
one that put me in here.

00:33:31.444 --> 00:33:33.654
Oh, yeah. Scrapper 142.

00:33:33.738 --> 00:33:35.865
Gotta watch out for
those Asgardians, man.

00:33:35.948 --> 00:33:37.533
They are hard to perish.

00:33:37.742 --> 00:33:39.118
Asgardian?

00:33:40.953 --> 00:33:42.830
Hey. Hey.

00:33:43.581 --> 00:33:44.582
Hey.

00:33:44.957 --> 00:33:47.585
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.

00:33:49.295 --> 00:33:50.671
Asgard is in danger.

00:33:55.176 --> 00:33:56.636
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.931
I used to wanna be a
Valkyrie when I was younger...

00:34:00.264 --> 00:34:02.558
until I found out that
you were all women.

00:34:02.725 --> 00:34:03.726
There's nothing wrong
with women, of course.

00:34:03.809 --> 00:34:04.810
I love women.

00:34:05.019 --> 00:34:06.437
Sometimes a little too much.

00:34:06.646 --> 00:34:07.688
Not in a creepy way,

00:34:07.772 --> 00:34:09.482
just more of a
respectful appreciation.

00:34:09.774 --> 00:34:11.025
I think it's great that there is

00:34:11.108 --> 00:34:14.153
an elite force of
women warriors.

00:34:14.403 --> 00:34:15.821
It's about time.

00:34:17.323 --> 00:34:18.449
Are you done?

00:34:18.533 --> 00:34:19.534
Lord of Thunder, you're up.

00:34:19.617 --> 00:34:20.701
Please, help me.
I need your help.

00:34:20.785 --> 00:34:21.786
Bye.

00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:24.038
Fine, then you must
be a traitor or a coward.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.582
Because the Valkyrie is
sworn to protect the throne.

00:34:27.208 --> 00:34:30.378
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

00:34:31.003 --> 00:34:32.588
And I'm a Scrapper,
not a Valkyrie.

00:34:35.925 --> 00:34:37.802
Bring him in for processing.

00:34:38.177 --> 00:34:41.889
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.

00:34:53.818 --> 00:34:55.278
Now, don't you move.

00:34:55.653 --> 00:34:58.155
My hands ain't as
steady as they used to be.

00:34:58.406 --> 00:35:01.200
By Odin's beard, you
shall not cut my hair...

00:35:01.534 --> 00:35:03.995
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.

00:35:08.374 --> 00:35:10.751
Please.
Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.

00:35:12.086 --> 00:35:13.421
Please! No!

00:35:13.629 --> 00:35:14.672
No!

00:35:20.129 --> 00:35:21.130
Which one's yours?

00:35:21.296 --> 00:35:22.714
Black. Brown seat.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.758
Where are my keys?

00:35:29.221 --> 00:35:30.222
Any day now.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.973
You can't just
steal a guy's car.

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.975
So you want me to chase
him down and un-steal it?

00:36:19.062 --> 00:36:21.106
- Okay. Any time now, please.
- Shut up.

00:36:55.682 --> 00:36:56.809
Okay, you got a plan,

00:36:56.975 --> 00:36:58.435
or shall I just stay
duck-and-cover?

00:36:58.602 --> 00:36:59.895
Yeah, my plan was
to drive us away.

00:37:00.062 --> 00:37:01.438
That's a shit plan.

00:37:14.326 --> 00:37:15.327
You're welcome.

00:37:28.632 --> 00:37:29.883
Oh, shit. He's back.

00:37:42.521 --> 00:37:43.522
Put your seat belt on.

00:37:43.689 --> 00:37:44.898
You're such a mom.

00:38:17.264 --> 00:38:18.348
Natasha, no.

00:38:19.141 --> 00:38:20.559
I think I'm bleeding. I'm...

00:38:22.686 --> 00:38:24.521
No. Not now, trust me.

00:39:17.074 --> 00:39:18.075
You okay?

00:39:18.826 --> 00:39:20.953
Yeah. Great plan.

00:39:21.662 --> 00:39:24.706
I love the part where
I almost bled to death.

00:39:26.333 --> 00:39:27.668
This is cozy.

00:39:27.835 --> 00:39:30.421
Barton and I spent two
days hiding out up here.

00:39:30.796 --> 00:39:32.172
That must have been fun.

00:39:33.632 --> 00:39:35.300
Who the hell is that guy?

00:39:35.467 --> 00:39:36.844
Dreykov's special project.

00:39:37.386 --> 00:39:39.388
He can mimic
anyone he's ever seen.

00:39:39.555 --> 00:39:40.681
It's like fighting a mirror.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:43.517
Dreykov only deploys him
for top-priority missions.

00:39:43.684 --> 00:39:45.352
This doesn't make any sense.

00:39:45.519 --> 00:39:48.981
Well, the truth rarely makes
sense when you omit key details.

00:39:50.816 --> 00:39:52.109
What is that supposed to mean?

00:39:52.276 --> 00:39:54.236
You didn't say one word
about Dreykov's daughter.

00:39:55.654 --> 00:39:56.947
You killed her.

00:39:57.614 --> 00:39:58.991
I had to.

00:40:00.284 --> 00:40:01.952
I needed her to
lead me to Dreykov.

00:40:03.287 --> 00:40:05.789
We need confirmation
Dreykov's in the building.

00:40:07.541 --> 00:40:08.834
His car is pulling up now.

00:40:26.435 --> 00:40:28.812
Dreykov's daughter
was collateral damage.

00:40:30.773 --> 00:40:32.649
I needed her to be sure.

00:40:32.983 --> 00:40:34.359
Natasha, we clear?

00:40:36.653 --> 00:40:37.654
All clear.

00:40:42.159 --> 00:40:44.286
And here you are, not so sure.

00:40:44.661 --> 00:40:46.955
I needed out.

00:41:07.449 --> 00:41:10.202
<i>Wow! Look at all of you.</i>

00:41:10.285 --> 00:41:11.953
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

00:41:12.204 --> 00:41:13.205
<i>Who's having fun?</i>

00:41:14.122 --> 00:41:15.999
<i>Please, I'm your host.</i>

00:41:16.249 --> 00:41:17.417
<i>Big round of applause</i>

00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:19.377
<i>for all of our
undercard competitors...</i>

00:41:19.628 --> 00:41:22.339
<i>who today died so gruesomely.</i>

00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:23.715
<i>Good sports.</i>

00:41:23.965 --> 00:41:25.550
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

00:41:26.259 --> 00:41:29.888
<i>This is what you've
come for, and so have I.</i>

00:41:35.936 --> 00:41:38.772
<i>And now, without further ado...</i>

00:41:38.855 --> 00:41:41.358
<i>it's main event time.</i>

00:41:43.276 --> 00:41:44.736
<i>Making his first appearance,</i>

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.363
<i>though he looks
quite promising...</i>

00:41:46.822 --> 00:41:48.490
<i>got a couple of
tricks up his sleeve.</i>

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:51.535
<i>I'll say no more,
see what you think.</i>

00:41:52.035 --> 00:41:53.203
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, I give you...</i>

00:41:54.329 --> 00:41:56.498
<i>Lord of Thunder.</i>

00:42:19.813 --> 00:42:21.982
<i>Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.</i>

00:42:22.065 --> 00:42:23.400
<i>Okay, this is it.</i>

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.820
<i>Let's get ready to welcome this guy.
Here he comes.</i>

00:42:35.954 --> 00:42:37.247
<i>He is a creature.</i>

00:42:37.455 --> 00:42:38.748
<i>What can we say about him?</i>

00:42:38.832 --> 00:42:41.293
<i>Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.</i>

00:42:41.543 --> 00:42:43.962
<i>I feel a special
connection with him.</i>

00:42:45.797 --> 00:42:46.965
<i>He's undefeated.</i>

00:42:48.425 --> 00:42:49.843
<i>He's the reigning.</i>

00:42:52.262 --> 00:42:54.306
<i>He's the defending.</i>

00:42:54.806 --> 00:42:55.807
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

00:42:56.224 --> 00:42:57.225
<i>I give you...</i>

00:42:57.559 --> 00:42:58.560
Uh-oh.

00:43:02.105 --> 00:43:05.775
<i>your Incredible...</i>

00:43:09.613 --> 00:43:11.448
Hulk!

00:43:12.073 --> 00:43:13.408
Yes!

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:19.206
I have to get off this planet.

00:43:19.956 --> 00:43:21.708
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?

00:43:30.091 --> 00:43:31.218
Hey!

00:43:31.927 --> 00:43:33.136
We know each other.

00:43:33.595 --> 00:43:35.472
He's a friend from work.

00:43:44.856 --> 00:43:46.399
Where have you been?

00:43:46.608 --> 00:43:48.610
Everybody thought you were dead.

00:43:48.902 --> 00:43:50.695
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:52.864
I lost my hammer.

00:43:53.031 --> 00:43:55.992
Like, yesterday, so
that's still pretty fresh.

00:43:56.534 --> 00:43:58.703
Loki. Loki's alive.
Can you believe it?

00:43:58.995 --> 00:44:00.038
He's up there.

00:44:00.247 --> 00:44:02.165
Loki! Look who it is!

00:44:04.417 --> 00:44:06.419
Banner, I never
thought I would say this...

00:44:06.503 --> 00:44:08.755
but I'm happy to see you.

00:44:09.089 --> 00:44:11.424
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

00:44:17.222 --> 00:44:18.223
Banner.

00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:20.600
Hey, Banner!

00:44:21.184 --> 00:44:23.186
No Banner. Only Hulk.

00:44:23.687 --> 00:44:24.729
What are you doing?

00:44:24.813 --> 00:44:26.690
It's me. It's Thor!

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:48.378
Banner, we're friends.

00:44:48.461 --> 00:44:50.422
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!

00:44:57.554 --> 00:44:59.389
Here we go.

00:45:18.241 --> 00:45:19.326
What?

00:45:29.878 --> 00:45:31.254
Hey, big guy.

00:45:33.214 --> 00:45:35.091
The sun's getting real low.

00:45:46.394 --> 00:45:48.730
That's it. The sun's going down.

00:45:51.858 --> 00:45:53.443
I won't hurt you anymore.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.111
No one will.

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:09.292
Yes! That's how it feels!

00:46:10.877 --> 00:46:12.420
I'm just a huge
fan of the sport.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.555
All right. Screw it.

00:46:28.603 --> 00:46:29.729
Oh!

00:46:34.317 --> 00:46:35.402
I know you're in there, Banner.

00:46:35.485 --> 00:46:36.486
I'll get you out!

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.705
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

00:46:47.956 --> 00:46:49.082
I told them we were friends!

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.426
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:30.016
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

00:49:01.673 --> 00:49:04.300
Another day, another Doug.

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.730
The Red Room's still active.
Where is it?

00:49:23.897 --> 00:49:24.898
I have no idea.

00:49:25.649 --> 00:49:27.818
He moves location constantly.

00:49:27.985 --> 00:49:32.447
And every widow is sedated on
entry and exit for maximum security.

00:49:33.907 --> 00:49:37.160
I'm just finding it hard to believe
that he could stay off my radar.

00:49:37.327 --> 00:49:40.873
Well, it's not smart to attack an
Avenger if you want to stay hidden.

00:49:41.039 --> 00:49:43.208
I mean, the clue is in the name.

00:49:43.375 --> 00:49:44.668
Dreykov kills you,

00:49:44.835 --> 00:49:47.588
one of the big ones
comes to avenge you.

00:49:47.754 --> 00:49:49.089
Wait, what are the big ones?

00:49:49.256 --> 00:49:53.635
Well, I doubt the god from space
has to take an ibuprofen after a fight.

00:49:56.138 --> 00:49:58.307
Where did you think
I was all this time?

00:50:01.685 --> 00:50:05.397
I thought that you got out
and were living a normal life.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:08.817
And you just never
made contact again?

00:50:08.984 --> 00:50:10.861
Honestly, I thought you
didn't wanna see me.

00:50:10.944 --> 00:50:13.572
Bullshit.

00:50:13.739 --> 00:50:16.408
You just didn't want your
baby sister to tag along,

00:50:16.575 --> 00:50:18.285
whilst you saved the
world with the cool kids.

00:50:18.452 --> 00:50:20.412
You weren't really my sister.

00:50:23.749 --> 00:50:26.293
And the Avengers
aren't really your family.

00:50:27.002 --> 00:50:28.837
- Why do you always do that thing?
- Do what?

00:50:29.004 --> 00:50:31.465
The thing you do
when you're fighting.

00:50:31.632 --> 00:50:33.967
The... Like, the...

00:50:35.093 --> 00:50:36.887
This thing that you do

00:50:37.054 --> 00:50:39.097
when you whip your
hair when you're fighting

00:50:39.264 --> 00:50:40.724
with the arm and the hair.

00:50:40.807 --> 00:50:43.227
And you do, like,
a fighting pose.

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:44.853
It's a...

00:50:44.937 --> 00:50:46.730
It's a fighting pose.
You're a total poser.

00:50:46.897 --> 00:50:48.815
I'm not a poser.

00:50:48.899 --> 00:50:50.817
Oh, come on.
I mean, they're great poses,

00:50:50.984 --> 00:50:53.654
but it does look like you think
everyone's looking at you, like,

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.821
all the time.

00:50:54.905 --> 00:50:58.325
All that time that I spent posing, I
was trying to actually do something good

00:50:58.492 --> 00:51:01.912
to make up for all the pain
and suffering that we caused.

00:51:02.287 --> 00:51:04.456
Trying to be more
than just a trained killer.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.753
Well, then you
were fooling yourself

00:51:10.462 --> 00:51:14.258
because pain and suffering is every
day and we are both still a trained killer.

00:51:14.675 --> 00:51:17.636
Except I'm not the one that's
on the cover of a magazine.

00:51:17.803 --> 00:51:20.013
I'm not the killer that
little girls call their hero.

00:51:47.827 --> 00:51:48.828
Okay.

00:51:56.919 --> 00:51:58.087
Get up, Mommy.

00:51:58.254 --> 00:52:01.466
Pain only makes you
stronger, remember?

00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:12.685
The Red Guardian returns.

00:52:12.852 --> 00:52:15.313
The Red Guardian
returns triumphant.

00:52:17.064 --> 00:52:19.525
Please, please, I beg you.
No more undercover work.

00:52:19.609 --> 00:52:21.736
I wanna get back in the action.
I want my suit back.

00:52:21.819 --> 00:52:22.904
I wanna get back in it.

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:25.448
General Dreykov, it's
been over three years.

00:52:30.286 --> 00:52:31.871
Never let them take your heart.

00:52:34.123 --> 00:52:35.583
Did you get it?

00:52:41.339 --> 00:52:43.549
And the North Institute?

00:52:44.175 --> 00:52:45.176
Ashes.

00:52:45.343 --> 00:52:46.719
It's gonna be okay.

00:52:47.303 --> 00:52:48.930
How is Melina?

00:52:49.096 --> 00:52:51.390
She'll live. She's strong.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.729
- Mommy?
- Mom?

00:52:56.896 --> 00:52:58.856
- Daddy!
- I'll handle this.

00:52:59.023 --> 00:53:00.650
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Yelena!

00:53:00.817 --> 00:53:02.360
- Daddy!
- Get away from her!

00:53:04.111 --> 00:53:05.196
Don't touch her!

00:53:07.323 --> 00:53:09.242
Don't touch her!

00:53:09.909 --> 00:53:11.911
I will kill you all!

00:53:15.456 --> 00:53:16.582
Honey.

00:53:19.335 --> 00:53:20.670
You're gonna need
to hand me that gun.

00:53:25.133 --> 00:53:27.009
I don't wanna go back there.

00:53:27.468 --> 00:53:29.262
I wanna stay in Ohio.

00:53:30.596 --> 00:53:32.014
You can't take her.

00:53:33.099 --> 00:53:35.143
You can't.

00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:36.936
She's only six.

00:53:37.103 --> 00:53:38.146
You were even younger.

00:53:39.939 --> 00:53:40.982
It's okay.

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:43.901
Come here.

00:53:48.573 --> 00:53:49.574
You're gonna be all right.

00:53:51.784 --> 00:53:53.327
Do you know why
it's gonna be all right?

00:53:53.828 --> 00:53:59.000
'Cause my girls are the
toughest girls in the world.

00:53:59.542 --> 00:54:02.211
You're gonna take
care of each other, okay?

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:06.048
And everything,
everything's gonna be fine.

00:54:21.898 --> 00:54:24.317
That one, she has fire in her.

00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:27.987
What was her name?

00:54:29.113 --> 00:54:30.406
Natasha.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.370
Ah... Natasha.

00:54:53.465 --> 00:54:54.466
No!

00:55:05.394 --> 00:55:07.396
Remove all the defects.

00:55:13.194 --> 00:55:14.570
That one

00:55:15.029 --> 00:55:16.322
and her.

00:55:16.697 --> 00:55:17.907
No!

00:55:18.073 --> 00:55:19.074
Yelena!

00:55:23.913 --> 00:55:26.415
Take it! Take it! No!

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:35.966
No!

00:55:41.263 --> 00:55:43.516
The Red Room is your home now.

00:55:44.266 --> 00:55:45.935
Get off me! No!

00:55:55.457 --> 00:55:57.960
<i>Undercover spies
in our communities.</i>

00:55:58.043 --> 00:56:00.796
<i>They took on false identities,
even raised families...</i>
