WEBVTT

00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:29.513
Request clearance for landing.

00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:33.100
Melina?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.773
We're touching down
in one minute.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.568
Then why are we still going up?

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.240
Now you'll know how Dreykov
stayed above the radar all these years.

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:09.078
Alexei.

00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:04.095
My God.

00:04:04.262 --> 00:04:05.805
Look at you.

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:09.768
So, uh,

00:04:10.352 --> 00:04:11.978
how was the family reunion?

00:04:12.145 --> 00:04:14.022
Oh, it was awful.

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:15.273
They were clingy,

00:04:15.357 --> 00:04:17.484
and too emotional, and needy.

00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:20.028
- Just like old times, huh?
- Hmm.

00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:21.613
Yelena Belova.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.490
What's the deal with her?

00:04:23.657 --> 00:04:25.909
She was the only
one affected, right?

00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:27.619
As far as I know, yes.

00:04:28.203 --> 00:04:30.747
These gasses and antidotes,

00:04:31.373 --> 00:04:34.000
it's a pain in my ass.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.545
It's a problem.
You need to sort it.

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:38.964
Hmm. I have nine pigs

00:04:39.047 --> 00:04:40.048
that will require attending
to in my absence.

00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:43.426
Don't give a shit
about your pigs.

00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:50.892
Cut her brain out...

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.396
Hmm? Identify the weakness.

00:05:03.947 --> 00:05:06.491
This is a much
less cool way to die.

00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:12.026
What about Romanoff?

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.463
She's a traitor.

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:18.426
She turned her back
on her people. On her blood.

00:05:19.427 --> 00:05:21.346
She had nothing.

00:05:21.513 --> 00:05:25.308
I gave her home.
I gave her love.

00:05:25.808 --> 00:05:28.102
Put that thing in her you do.

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:30.355
You know, uh, chemicals.

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:34.526
Turn her into one of your pigs.

00:05:35.256 --> 00:05:36.549
Natasha.

00:05:38.843 --> 00:05:40.720
I can't save us.

00:05:41.638 --> 00:05:43.514
I need you to
know that I'm sorry.

00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:45.558
I pledged my life to a cause.

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:48.061
You know, I thought I
was being very brave.

00:05:48.227 --> 00:05:49.354
Possibly the bravest.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.023
But I wasn't being brave.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.733
I was coward.

00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:00.990
In Cuba,

00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:04.827
when they came and
took you away from me...

00:06:06.162 --> 00:06:08.706
No cause is worth that.

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:13.628
You should only
sacrifice yourself

00:06:14.504 --> 00:06:16.047
for something...

00:06:23.888 --> 00:06:25.765
How did you do that?

00:06:26.557 --> 00:06:28.810
I designed these cells myself.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.435
What?

00:06:33.918 --> 00:06:38.465
Can you imagine what I could do
with an Avenger under my control?

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:41.092
Wouldn't you like
to speak to her first?

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:44.679
When you look into the eyes
of a child you have raised,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.224
no mask in the
world can hide that.

00:07:02.113 --> 00:07:03.281
Welcome home.

00:07:05.283 --> 00:07:06.951
Now, now.

00:07:08.244 --> 00:07:10.413
Don't go breaking my new toy.

00:07:10.793 --> 00:07:11.794
What?

00:07:12.295 --> 00:07:15.673
I bared my soul to you and it
was just you the whole time?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.427
Yes, I'm afraid so. But wait,
shh, I'm on comms with Yelena.

00:07:20.011 --> 00:07:22.597
Yelena, it's me. It's Mama.

00:07:22.764 --> 00:07:25.725
<i>You have a two-inch blade
concealed in your beltline.</i>

00:07:25.892 --> 00:07:26.893
What?

00:07:30.063 --> 00:07:32.065
What are you going to do to me?

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:34.400
<i>Outside right hip.</i>

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.704
Do you have a blanket?

00:08:48.504 --> 00:08:50.304
Killmonger has the full support

00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:51.544
of our military.

00:08:53.704 --> 00:08:55.904
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.

00:08:56.984 --> 00:08:58.104
Of course he did.

00:08:58.184 --> 00:08:59.984
That's what he
was trained to do.

00:09:00.144 --> 00:09:01.784
His unit used to
work with the CIA

00:09:01.864 --> 00:09:03.664
to destabilize
foreign countries.

00:09:03.864 --> 00:09:05.944
They would always strike
at transitions of power...

00:09:06.104 --> 00:09:08.264
like an election year, or
the death of a monarch.

00:09:08.424 --> 00:09:10.824
You get control of
government, the military...

00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:13.064
- Our resources.
- Right.

00:09:14.184 --> 00:09:15.184
The Great Mound.

00:09:15.344 --> 00:09:17.024
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.

00:09:17.184 --> 00:09:19.864
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

00:09:23.184 --> 00:09:25.504
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.

00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:26.664
What? What about you?

00:09:27.584 --> 00:09:29.544
The challenge will
have to continue.

00:09:29.704 --> 00:09:33.024
T'Challa, we will
not leave Wakanda.

00:09:33.144 --> 00:09:35.184
It is my duty to keep you safe.

00:09:35.344 --> 00:09:37.824
If he gets control
of our technology,

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:39.264
nowhere will be safe.

00:09:59.904 --> 00:10:01.824
The Black Panther lives.

00:10:02.784 --> 00:10:04.864
And when he fights for
the fate of Wakanda...

00:10:05.024 --> 00:10:07.584
I will be right
there beside him.

00:10:08.704 --> 00:10:09.904
As will I.

00:10:10.384 --> 00:10:11.624
I'm in, too.

00:10:13.384 --> 00:10:15.424
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:20.184
Are you done?

00:10:21.344 --> 00:10:23.384
Are you done?

00:10:24.944 --> 00:10:28.104
Could you give me and
Lord M'Baku a moment?

00:10:36.624 --> 00:10:37.744
Thank you.

00:10:38.384 --> 00:10:40.664
I owed you a great debt.

00:10:41.464 --> 00:10:43.024
A life for a life.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.744
Consider it paid.

00:10:45.424 --> 00:10:47.624
Please allow my
mother to stay here.

00:10:48.424 --> 00:10:51.344
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

00:10:52.504 --> 00:10:55.184
You know, I could
use an army as well.

00:10:55.304 --> 00:10:57.904
I bet you could.

00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:59.264
But no.

00:11:00.984 --> 00:11:03.584
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.

00:11:03.744 --> 00:11:05.424
It is our cause.

00:11:05.904 --> 00:11:08.344
- It is for all of us.
- Oh, us?

00:11:08.504 --> 00:11:10.784
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...

00:11:10.944 --> 00:11:14.904
and now you speak of "us"?

00:11:16.184 --> 00:11:18.864
I cannot speak for past kings.

00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:22.384
But an enemy sits on
the throne right now.

00:11:22.544 --> 00:11:25.424
We both know the
power of vibranium.

00:11:26.064 --> 00:11:28.144
If Killmonger gains
control of it,

00:11:28.264 --> 00:11:30.224
who do you think
he will come for next?

00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:41.184
We will not help you.

00:11:45.598 --> 00:11:47.266
You couldn't have
told me sooner?

00:11:47.349 --> 00:11:48.434
<i>Don't throw a fit.</i>

00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:49.894
- There wasn't time.
- Okay, girls,

00:11:49.977 --> 00:11:51.228
I'm having trouble hearing you,

00:11:51.312 --> 00:11:54.189
but, Natasha, there's
something I need you to know.

00:11:54.607 --> 00:11:59.028
I need you to know that I'm sorry.
No more excuses, okay?

00:11:59.695 --> 00:12:02.615
I gave my life for a cause.
I thought I was being brave.

00:12:02.781 --> 00:12:04.825
You don't have earpiece.

00:12:05.534 --> 00:12:06.535
What?

00:12:06.702 --> 00:12:07.828
No, she can't hear you.

00:12:07.995 --> 00:12:09.413
- You don't have earpiece.
- Why not?

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.873
Because it wasn't
part of the plan.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.583
Oh, yeah?
Well, what was the plan?

00:12:13.292 --> 00:12:14.376
So, once we're inside,

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.045
I'll activate my tracker
and Ross will come running.

00:12:16.545 --> 00:12:19.715
You are aware that you
are still a global fugitive, yes?

00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:22.676
You know the facility.
There must be some way to land it.

00:12:23.844 --> 00:12:27.139
Instruct them to
confine us on level zero.

00:12:27.306 --> 00:12:29.975
Once I'm out, I can
activate the landing protocol,

00:12:30.142 --> 00:12:31.560
we can descend within the hour.

00:12:31.644 --> 00:12:33.312
Ah, problem.

00:12:33.479 --> 00:12:36.065
I only have one earpiece set.

00:12:36.857 --> 00:12:37.983
I'll give it to Yelena.

00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:39.735
Where did he take the vials?

00:12:39.902 --> 00:12:41.820
<i>Probably down to cold storage.</i>

00:12:41.987 --> 00:12:44.323
Dreykov still has the
widows under his control,

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.076
<i>so you have to expose
them to this antidote.</i>

00:12:47.493 --> 00:12:50.204
Yeah. Sure.
Easy.

00:12:51.872 --> 00:12:52.957
Is this your plan?

00:12:53.415 --> 00:12:54.750
My plan is to kill you.

00:12:54.917 --> 00:12:56.335
I'm alive.

00:12:57.419 --> 00:12:59.171
So, what do we do now?

00:13:00.464 --> 00:13:02.550
What was my mother's name?

00:13:06.136 --> 00:13:07.221
Ah...

00:13:08.264 --> 00:13:10.391
Where we buried her,

00:13:11.016 --> 00:13:12.893
there was a tree...

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.937
Um...

00:13:15.354 --> 00:13:16.897
A pink blossom.

00:13:17.314 --> 00:13:18.774
Beautiful.

00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:20.693
And there was a tombstone

00:13:20.859 --> 00:13:23.487
with her name engraved on it.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.781
What was her name?

00:13:25.864 --> 00:13:27.366
Ah.

00:13:29.702 --> 00:13:33.080
"Unknown."

00:13:35.124 --> 00:13:37.418
You don't feel anything?

00:13:38.669 --> 00:13:40.963
You feel anything when
I killed your daughter?

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.383
Is this your haunted past?

00:13:46.468 --> 00:13:48.470
Really?

00:13:58.022 --> 00:14:00.691
Thank you, Natasha.

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:07.531
You gave me my greatest weapon.

00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:12.369
Say hello.

00:14:27.593 --> 00:14:30.054
When your bomb exploded,

00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:32.765
it nearly killed my Antonia.

00:14:36.518 --> 00:14:40.356
I had to put a chip in
the back of her neck.

00:14:40.522 --> 00:14:42.858
In the back of her neck.

00:14:43.275 --> 00:14:45.236
Look at her.

00:14:45.736 --> 00:14:47.947
You find it difficult
to look at her?

00:14:48.864 --> 00:14:50.199
I do.

00:14:51.075 --> 00:14:53.702
She... She watches everything

00:14:54.578 --> 00:14:55.788
and she can do it.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.374
She's a perfect mimic.

00:15:00.459 --> 00:15:03.295
And she fights just
like all of your friends.

00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:09.552
Can she hear me?

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.139
What?

00:15:16.225 --> 00:15:18.352
You want to make
her feel better?

00:15:20.312 --> 00:15:22.982
You want to tell
her you're sorry?

00:15:24.316 --> 00:15:28.195
Well, you should have thought of
that before you blew her face off.

00:15:30.197 --> 00:15:32.741
But enough of all this bullshit.

00:15:34.076 --> 00:15:35.202
Go to work.

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:37.413
I have rats in the basement. Go.

00:15:39.957 --> 00:15:41.208
Go.

00:15:52.803 --> 00:15:54.388
Well, that was a mistake.

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:56.140
Was it?

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.685
You just sent away the one thing
that would stop me from killing you.

00:16:01.437 --> 00:16:02.438
Try, then.

00:16:02.605 --> 00:16:03.814
Do it.

00:16:08.611 --> 00:16:10.112
Is the safety on?

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.201
No.

00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:21.874
Try your knife.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.834
Ah...

00:16:30.841 --> 00:16:31.926
You're in trouble.

00:16:32.092 --> 00:16:33.427
How are you controlling me?

00:16:33.594 --> 00:16:35.638
I'm not controlling
you, Natasha.

00:16:36.305 --> 00:16:37.681
Well, not yet.

00:16:38.307 --> 00:16:40.476
But there is a pheromonal lock.

00:16:40.809 --> 00:16:45.231
Smelling my pheromones prevents you
from committing violence against me.

00:16:49.777 --> 00:16:52.446
I'm very upset with Melina.

00:16:52.613 --> 00:16:54.240
It's a shame I have to kill her.

00:16:55.199 --> 00:16:56.825
Come on, now.
If we're just going to

00:16:56.909 --> 00:16:58.744
press buttons and
hack computers...

00:16:58.911 --> 00:16:59.912
- Yes.
- I mean, I don't know.

00:16:59.995 --> 00:17:00.996
There's nothing for me to do.

00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:03.916
I want to...
I want to break something.

00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:05.000
Oh, you do?

00:17:06.752 --> 00:17:09.380
Oh, there is something
you can break.

00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:26.981
Melina, if this is the
last time that we...

00:17:29.066 --> 00:17:30.818
Ah, damn it.

00:17:43.664 --> 00:17:45.624
That was disgusting.

00:17:59.013 --> 00:18:00.180
Okay.

00:18:21.952 --> 00:18:24.705
So, this was the big plan, huh?

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:29.919
Melina was going to land the Red Room
and hand me over to the authorities.

00:18:33.297 --> 00:18:34.757
Oh, no, no, no.

00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:43.599
So, what now, you're gonna fold me
into your pathetic little puppeteer act?

00:18:43.766 --> 00:18:44.767
Pathetic, huh?

00:18:44.934 --> 00:18:46.602
Yeah, what would you call it?

00:18:46.769 --> 00:18:47.937
- I would call it...
- When was the last time

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.396
that you had a
conversation with somebody

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.315
that wasn't forced
to talk to you?

00:18:51.482 --> 00:18:54.443
You ran away to fight
in the wrong war.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.364
The real war was fought here,
in the shadows.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.115
You didn't fight in the shadows.

00:19:00.282 --> 00:19:01.492
You hid in the dark.

00:19:01.659 --> 00:19:05.454
Real power comes from
undetectable influence.

00:19:05.621 --> 00:19:08.040
If no one's noticed,
then why even do it?

00:19:08.374 --> 00:19:09.541
You're nothing.

00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:11.835
- Hmm.
- You have nothing.

00:19:12.336 --> 00:19:13.921
There are 50 people
on this planet...

00:19:14.088 --> 00:19:15.339
Oh, stop it.

00:19:15.506 --> 00:19:18.133
Don't tell me to stop!

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.220
If I don't tell you when to stop, then
how will you know when to shut up?

00:19:25.182 --> 00:19:26.308
Come on.

00:19:26.475 --> 00:19:28.310
Think I can't take a punch?

00:19:28.394 --> 00:19:29.478
Oh.

00:19:31.313 --> 00:19:34.483
- God damn it, you're weak.
- Weak?

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.819
I bet it's easier to be tough in
front of defenseless little girls, huh?

00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:38.612
That's enough.

00:19:48.706 --> 00:19:50.332
You wouldn't be so glib

00:19:50.499 --> 00:19:54.169
if you had any notion of
the scope of what I've built.

00:19:55.796 --> 00:19:58.382
I own this world. Me.

00:19:58.549 --> 00:20:00.301
You seem desperate
to impress me.

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:01.802
I don't need to impress you.

00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:04.471
I don't need to impress anyone.

00:20:05.681 --> 00:20:08.851
These world leaders,
these great men,

00:20:09.685 --> 00:20:12.521
they answer to me and my widows.

00:20:16.275 --> 00:20:17.359
Look at them.

00:20:20.154 --> 00:20:21.864
These girls were trash.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.075
They are thrown out
into the street.

00:20:25.534 --> 00:20:28.829
I recycle the trash.

00:20:28.996 --> 00:20:30.873
And I give them purpose.

00:20:32.708 --> 00:20:34.501
I give them a life.

00:20:41.717 --> 00:20:43.969
Melina, I found the
location of the vials.

00:20:45.346 --> 00:20:47.348
I've had a slight setback.

00:20:49.433 --> 00:20:51.143
You'll need to
get to the widows.

00:21:22.784 --> 00:21:23.944
Everything is on schedule.

00:21:24.144 --> 00:21:25.304
Have the spies been alerted?

00:21:25.464 --> 00:21:27.584
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

00:21:27.944 --> 00:21:29.464
But the War Dogs in London,

00:21:29.544 --> 00:21:31.344
New York and Hong
Kong are standing by.

00:21:33.024 --> 00:21:34.584
We'll strike there first.

00:21:34.744 --> 00:21:36.544
The others'll come around.

00:21:36.704 --> 00:21:38.144
Look at this.

00:21:38.304 --> 00:21:39.384
A handheld sonic cannon,

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:40.864
powerful enough
to stop a tank...

00:21:41.024 --> 00:21:42.624
untraceable by metal detectors.

00:21:42.824 --> 00:21:44.864
And we got thousands of them.

00:21:47.024 --> 00:21:50.144
The world's gonna find
out exactly who we are.

00:22:21.664 --> 00:22:22.904
He lives.

00:22:26.944 --> 00:22:28.864
N'Jadaka!

00:22:30.064 --> 00:22:31.304
Wassup?

00:22:31.504 --> 00:22:33.224
I never yielded!

00:22:33.984 --> 00:22:37.704
And as you can
see, I am not dead!

00:22:38.224 --> 00:22:40.304
All that challenge
shit is over with!

00:22:40.424 --> 00:22:41.544
I'm the king now!

00:22:41.704 --> 00:22:43.904
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

00:22:52.384 --> 00:22:53.984
- Shuri, now.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

00:22:57.304 --> 00:23:00.024
Go, go, go! Come on, Ross!

00:23:00.184 --> 00:23:02.624
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

00:23:03.824 --> 00:23:06.904
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.

00:23:10.944 --> 00:23:12.104
What will we do?

00:23:13.504 --> 00:23:14.624
Border Tribe!

00:23:28.664 --> 00:23:29.664
You!

00:23:29.824 --> 00:23:32.184
Your heart is
so full of hatred...

00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:34.184
you are not fit to be a king!

00:23:38.464 --> 00:23:39.544
Come on!

00:23:39.624 --> 00:23:41.184
Ayo, the king!

00:24:28.144 --> 00:24:29.144
Ah!

00:24:32.624 --> 00:24:33.944
W'Kabi, stop this!

00:24:35.184 --> 00:24:36.704
Stop this now!

00:24:40.864 --> 00:24:41.864
No!

00:25:17.863 --> 00:25:19.699
It's my network of widows

00:25:19.782 --> 00:25:22.910
that help me control
the scales of power.

00:25:23.244 --> 00:25:27.331
One command, the oil
and stock markets crumble.

00:25:27.498 --> 00:25:31.585
One command, and a quarter
of the planet will starve.

00:25:31.752 --> 00:25:34.880
My widows can start
and end wars.

00:25:35.131 --> 00:25:37.842
They can make and break kings.

00:25:41.846 --> 00:25:44.390
You control all
of that from here?

00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:47.018
And with you,

00:25:47.685 --> 00:25:50.730
an Avenger under my control,

00:25:52.106 --> 00:25:54.567
I can finally come
out of the shadows

00:25:55.693 --> 00:26:00.448
using the only natural resource
that the world has too much of.

00:26:02.033 --> 00:26:03.409
Girls.

00:26:13.711 --> 00:26:16.088
All from that little console?

00:26:16.839 --> 00:26:18.049
Yeah.

00:26:22.386 --> 00:26:24.138
Oh, you find this amusing?

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:25.973
Why are you smiling?

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.684
Don't take it personal,
but, uh...

00:26:30.978 --> 00:26:33.064
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:26:33.522 --> 00:26:37.735
Even if you locate the database
and get him to show you the key,

00:26:37.985 --> 00:26:40.446
you won't be able
to take it from him.

00:26:40.613 --> 00:26:43.991
For years, Dreykov has
implemented a pheromonal lock

00:26:44.158 --> 00:26:45.993
in all widows, even me.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.748
So, as long as we can smell him,
then we won't be able to hurt him.

00:26:50.831 --> 00:26:52.541
Well, I'll just hold my breath.

00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:54.168
Not enough.

00:26:54.335 --> 00:26:56.045
This is basic science.

00:26:56.212 --> 00:26:59.465
Natasha, to block receptors
in olfactory center,

00:26:59.632 --> 00:27:01.676
you have to sever the nerve.

00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:04.845
I can handle that.

00:27:05.763 --> 00:27:08.140
You weren't quite
strong enough, so...

00:27:09.016 --> 00:27:10.768
I'll have to finish it myself.

00:27:10.851 --> 00:27:12.895
What are you going to do?

00:27:14.855 --> 00:27:16.148
Sever the nerve.

00:27:39.547 --> 00:27:40.965
Melina!

00:27:52.309 --> 00:27:53.894
Precisely what I was thinking.

00:28:06.574 --> 00:28:08.367
Yelena, slight change of plan.

00:28:08.534 --> 00:28:11.829
I completely demolished one of the engines
and we are going into a controlled crash.

00:28:14.874 --> 00:28:15.875
Fantastic.

00:28:16.042 --> 00:28:17.543
I'm heading to the widows now.

00:28:18.753 --> 00:28:20.046
No.

00:29:06.446 --> 00:29:09.362
Nakia and I will get control
of the <i>Royal Talon</i>  with this.

00:29:09.545 --> 00:29:10.985
So what do I do?

00:29:11.145 --> 00:29:12.265
You'll have to fly it.

00:29:13.105 --> 00:29:15.025
- What?
- You were a great pilot.

00:29:15.225 --> 00:29:17.265
Don't worry, I'll
guide you through it.

00:29:17.425 --> 00:29:19.545
It's just like
riding a hoverbike.

00:29:20.265 --> 00:29:21.905
What? You guys have hoverbikes?

00:29:22.105 --> 00:29:23.865
Hey, Nakia, take that.

00:29:24.065 --> 00:29:26.785
I'm not a Dora.
Just put it on, it's armor!

00:29:28.305 --> 00:29:29.345
Come!

00:29:31.785 --> 00:29:32.945
Good luck, Agent Ross!

00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:34.465
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm doing with this.

00:29:34.545 --> 00:29:35.945
We're counting on you.

00:29:48.585 --> 00:29:49.985
Wakanda forever.

00:29:58.225 --> 00:29:59.225
Come on!

00:30:09.705 --> 00:30:10.825
Go, go!

00:30:16.745 --> 00:30:19.625
<i>Remote piloting
system activated.</i>

00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:21.625
My God.

00:30:21.785 --> 00:30:24.825
<i>I made it American style
for you. Get in.</i>

00:30:24.985 --> 00:30:26.545
All right.

00:30:32.745 --> 00:30:33.745
Yes!

00:30:35.825 --> 00:30:38.545
Go! We can't let those
weapons get beyond Wakanda.

00:30:40.545 --> 00:30:41.585
All right, I'm on it.

00:31:12.825 --> 00:31:14.945
Wakanda forever!

00:31:22.745 --> 00:31:24.985
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em.
What do I do?

00:31:25.185 --> 00:31:26.545
Shoot them down, genius!

00:31:26.705 --> 00:31:27.705
All right.

00:31:29.345 --> 00:31:30.385
Here goes nothing.

00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:38.745
All right, got them.

00:31:43.105 --> 00:31:44.305
Oh, shit.

00:31:45.265 --> 00:31:47.025
Shit, shit, shit.

00:32:07.345 --> 00:32:08.425
Nice!

00:32:43.665 --> 00:32:44.705
Shuri!

00:32:48.985 --> 00:32:50.385
What's up, Princess?

00:32:50.545 --> 00:32:52.625
You'll never be a true king.

00:32:55.585 --> 00:32:56.585
Brother!

00:33:28.745 --> 00:33:30.025
Shuri.

00:33:30.465 --> 00:33:31.465
Brother!

00:33:32.345 --> 00:33:34.025
Turn on the train
on the bottom track.

00:33:34.185 --> 00:33:36.225
<i>The stabilizers will
deactivate your suit!</i>

00:33:36.385 --> 00:33:37.705
You won't have protection!

00:33:37.865 --> 00:33:39.225
Neither will he.

00:33:39.385 --> 00:33:40.745
Okay!

00:34:04.785 --> 00:34:07.065
I don't need a suit to kill you.

00:34:07.265 --> 00:34:08.465
Your reign is over!

00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:10.225
You sat up here,
safe and protected.

00:34:10.385 --> 00:34:11.785
You want to see us become

00:34:11.865 --> 00:34:13.785
just like the people
you hate so much.

00:34:13.945 --> 00:34:15.705
Divide and conquer
the land as they did!

00:34:15.865 --> 00:34:18.305
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.

00:34:18.465 --> 00:34:19.705
You have become them!

00:34:20.025 --> 00:34:22.385
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

00:34:22.545 --> 00:34:24.305
The world took everything
away from me!

00:34:24.465 --> 00:34:25.985
Everything I ever loved!

00:34:26.145 --> 00:34:27.585
But I'mma make sure we're even.

00:34:27.785 --> 00:34:28.905
I'mma track down
anyone who would

00:34:28.985 --> 00:34:30.465
even think about
being loyal to you!

00:34:30.665 --> 00:34:31.945
And I'm gonna put
they ass in the dirt

00:34:32.025 --> 00:34:33.105
right next to Zuri!

00:34:40.258 --> 00:34:42.886
Not so talkative now, are you?

00:34:44.554 --> 00:34:45.638
You took my childhood.

00:34:47.265 --> 00:34:49.809
You took my choices
and tried to break me.

00:34:49.976 --> 00:34:52.020
But you're never gonna do
that to anybody ever again.

00:35:03.448 --> 00:35:07.035
Nobody leaves this
room until she's dead.

00:35:07.202 --> 00:35:09.371
Make her suffer.

00:35:11.581 --> 00:35:12.999
I don't wanna hurt you.

00:35:13.583 --> 00:35:15.001
You don't wanna hurt me.

00:37:09.032 --> 00:37:10.241
Hey.

00:37:10.617 --> 00:37:11.618
Are you okay?

00:37:12.911 --> 00:37:14.037
That looks like it hurts.

00:37:14.204 --> 00:37:16.414
Okay. I take out
on three, ready?

00:37:16.623 --> 00:37:18.583
I'm sorry.

00:37:24.172 --> 00:37:26.341
Get as far away
from here as possible.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.885
You get to make
your own choices now.

00:37:39.938 --> 00:37:41.147
We gotta get outta here.

00:37:41.314 --> 00:37:42.399
We need to find Dreykov.
Are you coming?

00:37:42.482 --> 00:37:43.692
I'm right behind you.

00:37:50.407 --> 00:37:53.702
Wait, wait!
I have to go back!

00:38:33.992 --> 00:38:34.993
Yes!

00:39:32.258 --> 00:39:33.677
Do you see the girls?

00:39:36.554 --> 00:39:37.555
No!

00:40:10.422 --> 00:40:12.007
We need to go back.

00:40:39.325 --> 00:40:40.952
We've lost control.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.478
Antonia.

00:41:09.356 --> 00:41:11.483
No!

00:41:12.776 --> 00:41:14.486
I'm gonna open the door.

00:41:15.278 --> 00:41:17.113
You're gonna come after me.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.491
It's okay. It's okay.

00:41:21.618 --> 00:41:23.787
I know you're still in there.

00:41:25.705 --> 00:41:28.625
And I'm not gonna leave you.
Okay.

00:42:43.033 --> 00:42:44.034
Yelena!

00:42:45.577 --> 00:42:47.078
She's on the wing!

00:42:47.245 --> 00:42:49.622
Move! What are you waiting for?

00:42:51.166 --> 00:42:52.167
Don't do it!

00:42:53.126 --> 00:42:54.794
This was fun!

00:42:54.961 --> 00:42:56.004
No!

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.014
Okay.

00:44:36.224 --> 00:44:37.725
Let's go.

00:44:52.532 --> 00:44:53.783
Enough.

00:45:45.168 --> 00:45:46.586
I'm sorry.

00:45:46.753 --> 00:45:48.171
I'm sorry.

00:45:51.382 --> 00:45:52.967
Is he gone?

00:45:57.347 --> 00:45:58.598
He's gone.

00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:09.027
Shit. What the hell was that?

00:46:09.158 --> 00:46:10.518
<i>The lab is under attack.</i>

00:46:10.625 --> 00:46:11.665
What? Where?

00:46:11.745 --> 00:46:13.665
<i>Deactivating hologram.</i>

00:46:17.705 --> 00:46:20.545
<i>Ross, you have to
get out of there, now!</i>

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:22.505
How long have I got?

00:46:23.225 --> 00:46:26.225
<i>Glass integrity is at 50%.</i>

00:46:27.025 --> 00:46:28.065
Put me back in.

00:46:28.225 --> 00:46:29.945
<i>Ross! Ross!</i>

00:46:48.865 --> 00:46:50.345
Surrender now!

00:46:50.825 --> 00:46:53.705
You have three seconds
to lay down your weapon!

00:46:53.865 --> 00:46:54.985
One!

00:46:55.105 --> 00:46:56.105
Two!

00:47:06.185 --> 00:47:10.385
Witness the might
of the Jabari firsthand!

00:47:51.465 --> 00:47:53.785
<i>Glass integrity is at 15%.</i>

00:48:02.665 --> 00:48:04.665
<i>Critical weapons failure.</i> Shit!

00:48:09.905 --> 00:48:11.545
Hey, Shuri! The last cargo ship

00:48:11.625 --> 00:48:12.865
is almost at the border...

00:48:13.025 --> 00:48:14.185
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

00:48:14.345 --> 00:48:15.665
Make an X with your arms!

00:48:16.465 --> 00:48:18.665
<i>Sonic Overload initiated.</i>

00:48:19.465 --> 00:48:20.665
Now break it!

00:48:29.545 --> 00:48:31.505
<i>System rebooting in five...</i>

00:48:31.945 --> 00:48:34.025
<i>four, three...</i>

00:48:34.185 --> 00:48:35.785
<i>two, one.</i>

00:48:36.385 --> 00:48:37.505
<i>System rebooted.</i>

00:48:49.825 --> 00:48:51.185
Yes! We did it!

00:48:51.345 --> 00:48:52.905
<i>Great! Now get out of there!</i>

00:49:25.145 --> 00:49:27.465
Drop your weapon!

00:49:29.025 --> 00:49:31.185
Would you kill me, my love?

00:49:31.345 --> 00:49:32.865
For Wakanda?

00:49:36.145 --> 00:49:37.865
Without question!

00:50:21.865 --> 00:50:23.425
This is it for you, Cousin.

00:50:49.105 --> 00:50:50.665
Hell of a move!

00:51:11.865 --> 00:51:13.465
My pop said Wakanda was

00:51:13.545 --> 00:51:15.145
the most beautiful
thing he ever seen.

00:51:18.785 --> 00:51:21.305
He promised he was
gonna show it to me one day.

00:51:22.985 --> 00:51:24.545
You believe that?

00:51:25.425 --> 00:51:26.545
Kid from Oakland,

00:51:26.625 --> 00:51:28.505
running around
believing in fairy tales.

00:52:16.905 --> 00:52:18.825
It's beautiful.

00:52:33.025 --> 00:52:35.465
Maybe we can still heal you.

00:52:37.865 --> 00:52:39.065
Why?

00:52:40.785 --> 00:52:43.025
So you can just lock me up?

00:52:46.265 --> 00:52:47.585
Nah.

00:52:49.785 --> 00:52:51.465
Just bury me in the ocean...

00:52:51.625 --> 00:52:54.185
with my ancestors that
jumped from the ships.

00:52:55.025 --> 00:52:58.385
'Cause they knew death
was better than bondage.

00:54:22.945 --> 00:54:23.945
Thank you.

00:54:25.945 --> 00:54:27.545
You saved me.

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:30.585
You saved my family.

00:54:32.825 --> 00:54:34.265
Our nation.

00:54:34.425 --> 00:54:36.745
There's nothing to thank me for.

00:54:36.905 --> 00:54:38.465
It is our duty to...

00:54:42.105 --> 00:54:44.705
It was my duty to
fight for what I love.

00:54:45.785 --> 00:54:46.745
I should've...

00:54:53.465 --> 00:54:55.665
You can't blame
me, I almost died.

00:54:59.345 --> 00:55:00.585
Stay.

00:55:03.065 --> 00:55:04.305
I think I know a way

00:55:04.385 --> 00:55:06.665
you can still
fulfill your calling.

00:55:07.825 --> 00:55:09.225
Please stay.

00:55:31.778 --> 00:55:32.779
Melina, wake up.

00:55:34.113 --> 00:55:35.406
- Melina?
- Mmm.

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:45.667
Oh, my left leg is broken.

00:56:19.018 --> 00:56:20.395
Yelena!

00:56:31.239 --> 00:56:32.532
Yelena?

00:56:39.247 --> 00:56:41.457
We're both upside down.

00:56:56.473 --> 00:56:57.765
I should've come back for you.

00:56:57.932 --> 00:56:59.100
You don't have to say that.

00:56:59.184 --> 00:57:00.477
- It's okay.
- Hey. Hey.

00:57:01.019 --> 00:57:02.604
It was real to me, too.

00:57:16.868 --> 00:57:17.869
Thank you.

00:57:32.967 --> 00:57:34.093
Everybody good?

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:36.679
I am clearly injured.

00:57:38.097 --> 00:57:40.016
You got something to say?

00:57:40.975 --> 00:57:42.393
I'd just mess it up.

00:57:56.741 --> 00:57:58.660
Here comes the cavalry.

00:58:01.663 --> 00:58:04.082
We're closing in
on the target, sir.

00:58:06.793 --> 00:58:08.753
So, what's our plan?

00:58:09.671 --> 00:58:12.257
You guys go. I'll stay.

00:58:12.423 --> 00:58:14.384
That's insanity. We fight.
We fight with you.

00:58:14.467 --> 00:58:16.344
- I'll hold them off.
- Natasha, we fight.

00:58:16.427 --> 00:58:17.971
We can't split up.
You're so pigheaded.

00:58:18.137 --> 00:58:20.306
- You guys, go.
- Oh, my God.

00:58:20.473 --> 00:58:23.226
Besides, if it can work out
with the four of us, you know,

00:58:23.393 --> 00:58:25.812
there may be some
hope for the Avengers.

00:58:25.979 --> 00:58:27.272
Little bit.

00:58:27.438 --> 00:58:31.359
Okay, well, if you're leaving,
then I guess you should take this.

00:58:31.526 --> 00:58:34.070
I know how much you like it.

00:58:34.237 --> 00:58:36.030
Shucks.

00:58:36.114 --> 00:58:37.365
It does have a lot of pockets.

00:58:37.532 --> 00:58:39.534
Very handy pockets, yeah.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:42.829
He had widows implanted
all over the world.

00:58:42.996 --> 00:58:44.873
Melina will need
to copy the formula,

00:58:45.415 --> 00:58:47.208
but you should be the
one to tell 'em it's over.

00:59:07.061 --> 00:59:08.980
You came back for us.

00:59:17.655 --> 00:59:19.115
Thank you.

00:59:24.162 --> 00:59:25.413
Hey.

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.875
Hey. You take care
of yourself, okay?

00:59:29.042 --> 00:59:30.168
Don't worry. I got this.

00:59:30.335 --> 00:59:31.794
I know.

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:45.099
Don't worry.
We're bringing her with us.

00:59:45.809 --> 00:59:48.102
Come. Come with us.

01:00:34.679 --> 01:00:36.839
My name is King T'Challa...

01:00:36.999 --> 01:00:39.119
son of King T'Chaka.

01:00:39.279 --> 01:00:43.599
I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.

01:00:43.759 --> 01:00:46.519
And for the first
time in our history...

01:00:46.679 --> 01:00:49.919
we will be sharing our
knowledge and resources...

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.959
with the outside world.

01:00:52.119 --> 01:00:55.479
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.

01:00:55.679 --> 01:00:57.079
We cannot.

01:00:58.199 --> 01:00:59.719
We must not.

01:01:00.039 --> 01:01:02.679
We will work to be an
example of how we...

01:01:02.839 --> 01:01:05.079
as brothers and
sisters on this earth...

01:01:05.239 --> 01:01:07.319
should treat each other.

01:01:07.479 --> 01:01:09.319
Now, more than ever...

01:01:10.559 --> 01:01:14.999
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.

01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:17.359
We all know the truth.

01:01:17.519 --> 01:01:20.919
More connects us
than separates us.

01:01:21.079 --> 01:01:22.759
But in times of crisis...

01:01:22.959 --> 01:01:25.399
the wise build bridges...

01:01:25.559 --> 01:01:28.359
while the foolish
build barriers.

01:01:28.519 --> 01:01:30.559
We must find a way...

01:01:30.759 --> 01:01:33.359
to look after one another...

01:01:33.519 --> 01:01:38.239
as if we were one, single tribe.

01:01:38.399 --> 01:01:39.879
With all due respect,
King T'Challa...

01:01:40.039 --> 01:01:41.279
what can a nation of farmers

01:01:41.359 --> 01:01:43.239
have to offer the
rest of the world?

01:01:55.898 --> 01:01:57.658
Oh, he moves it! He moves it!

01:01:57.818 --> 01:01:59.498
- Who man is that?
- Bucket!

01:01:59.658 --> 01:02:00.658
Easy.

01:02:03.658 --> 01:02:05.018
When you said you would take me

01:02:05.098 --> 01:02:07.018
to California for
the first time...

01:02:07.178 --> 01:02:09.138
I thought you meant Coachella...

01:02:09.338 --> 01:02:10.778
or Disneyland.

01:02:11.458 --> 01:02:12.898
Why here?

01:02:16.018 --> 01:02:19.458
This is where our
father killed our uncle.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.378
They're tearing it down.

01:02:27.498 --> 01:02:28.498
Good.

01:02:28.658 --> 01:02:30.658
They are not tearing it down.

01:02:31.778 --> 01:02:33.418
I bought this building.

01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:37.378
And that building.

01:02:38.218 --> 01:02:39.938
And that one over there.

01:02:41.178 --> 01:02:42.458
This will be the first

01:02:42.538 --> 01:02:44.858
Wakandan International
Outreach Center.

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:48.778
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.

01:02:49.538 --> 01:02:50.778
And you will spearhead

01:02:50.858 --> 01:02:53.098
the science and
information exchange.

01:02:53.818 --> 01:02:55.738
You're kidding.

01:02:56.138 --> 01:02:57.418
Eh?

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:07.698
Oh...

01:03:07.778 --> 01:03:10.698
Hey, yo.
Man, what the hell is that?

01:03:10.858 --> 01:03:12.578
That's like a Bugatti spaceship!

01:03:12.738 --> 01:03:15.338
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:19.618
What?

01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:22.458
Check it out, bro.

01:03:22.618 --> 01:03:23.978
We can take this
back to the house.

01:03:25.298 --> 01:03:26.378
Pull up to school in this.

01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:28.418
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.

01:03:28.498 --> 01:03:29.498
On eBay.

01:03:29.578 --> 01:03:30.658
Everybody get,
like, a million apiece.

01:03:30.818 --> 01:03:32.098
I wouldn't do that
if I were you guys.

01:03:32.178 --> 01:03:33.298
- Where you come from?
- From Wakanda.

01:03:33.378 --> 01:03:34.538
What is a Wakanda?

01:03:34.618 --> 01:03:35.618
Hey, yo!

01:03:36.338 --> 01:03:37.538
This yours?

01:03:41.338 --> 01:03:42.698
Who...

01:03:43.058 --> 01:03:44.218
Who are you?

01:04:03.407 --> 01:04:04.534
You ever not sleep?

01:04:05.412 --> 01:04:08.791
I've been in six different time
zones in three days because of you.

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:10.251
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:04:10.417 --> 01:04:12.878
What, are you scrapping
together some parts?

01:04:13.045 --> 01:04:16.590
What'd you get me this time,
like, an upside-down lawnmower?

01:04:21.762 --> 01:04:24.056
You see what I can get you
with a bit of time and money?

01:04:30.062 --> 01:04:31.689
Go on, say it. I wanna hear it.

01:04:31.856 --> 01:04:34.483
It would really be good
for me to hear it. Really.

01:04:35.734 --> 01:04:36.902
I'm impressed.

01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:38.737
Well, yeah.

01:04:39.363 --> 01:04:41.991
You've always been a
really good friend to me.

01:04:42.158 --> 01:04:44.660
That's what every
man wants to hear.

01:04:45.452 --> 01:04:46.620
Where you gonna go?

01:04:47.955 --> 01:04:50.624
It's funny. My whole life,
I didn't think I had any family.

01:04:50.791 --> 01:04:52.960
Turns out I got two, so...

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.753
One of them's a bit
of a mess right now.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.715
I'm gonna go break a
few of them out of prison

01:04:58.215 --> 01:05:00.718
see if I can't help
patch things up.

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.140
You sure about this?

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.020
I can't trust my own mind.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.940
So, until they figure out

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.540
how to get this stuff
out of my head...

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.100
I think going back under
is the best thing.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.380
For everybody.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:28.820
Thank you for this.

01:06:31.295 --> 01:06:34.055
You know, if they
find out he's here...

01:06:34.215 --> 01:06:36.375
they'll come for him.

01:06:38.135 --> 01:06:39.815
Let them try.

01:07:36.077 --> 01:07:38.913
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:43.043
...about one of the most valuable
traits a soldier or student can have.

01:07:43.209 --> 01:07:44.878
Patience.

01:07:45.045 --> 01:07:47.172
Sometimes patience
is the key to victory.

01:07:47.339 --> 01:07:49.382
Sometimes it
leads to very little...

01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:51.885
...and it seems
like it's not worth it.

01:07:52.052 --> 01:07:53.553
And you wonder...

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.557
...why you waited so long for
something so disappointing.

01:08:01.269 --> 01:08:03.271
How many more of these?
