WEBVTT

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.220
<i>New York. Queens.</i>

00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:24.353
<i>It's a rough borough,
but, hey, it's home.</i>

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.849
Who you talking to?

00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:28.184
No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.

00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:29.561
You know you can't
show it to anyone.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:30.812
Yeah, I know.

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:32.355
Then why are you
narrating in that voice?

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:35.525
- Um.... Because it's fun.
- Fun.

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:38.695
So, uh, why do
they call you Happy?

00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:43.533
Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.619
Hey, should I go to
the bathroom before?

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:46.953
There's a bathroom on it.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.205
Whoa, no pilot? That's awesome.

00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:50.749
- Ahh.
- Is that where you're gonna sit?

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:52.000
Yeah.

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:54.169
This is your first time
on a private plane?

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:55.879
My first time on any plane.

00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:58.798
Should it--? Should it be--?
Should it be making that noise?

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:00.425
Shh. Shh.

00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:11.770
No one has actually told me why
I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:15.148
<i>Something about Captain
America going crazy.</i>

00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:17.108
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:19.361
We're not roommates. Suit up.

00:01:19.527 --> 00:01:20.862
Okay, Peter, you got this.

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:24.115
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's my suit.

00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:26.076
- Where's the case?
- What case?

00:01:26.242 --> 00:01:27.827
What?
I thought that was a closet.

00:01:27.994 --> 00:01:29.245
- This is still my room?
- Go.

00:01:29.412 --> 00:01:31.206
- My room is way bigger than--
- There.

00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:33.083
I found the case.
I found the case.

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:35.543
"A minor upgrade"?

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.170
Whoa.

00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:38.964
Oh, my God.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.340
- Put it on.
- What the--?

00:01:40.507 --> 00:01:42.425
This is the coolest
thing I've ever seen--

00:01:42.592 --> 00:01:44.928
- Let's go.
- But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.

00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:47.472
Is it for me? Happy.
Happy, wait.

00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:50.517
This is insane. Insane.

00:01:50.684 --> 00:01:52.811
Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:55.272
- This is the greatest day of my life. Okay.
- Let's go.

00:01:55.438 --> 00:01:57.649
Okay, there's Captain
America, Iron Man...

00:01:57.816 --> 00:01:59.567
...Black Widow.
Whoa, who's that new guy?

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:02.570
- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.

00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:05.699
Hey, everyone.

00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:08.785
The craziest thing
just happened.

00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:12.622
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him--

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.083
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.

00:02:18.378 --> 00:02:21.464
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"

00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:24.676
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?" And--

00:02:26.177 --> 00:02:28.805
Hey, just a second! Coming!

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.224
Hey.

00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:33.184
We have thin walls here.

00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:37.147
What are you doing,
a little video diary?

00:02:37.897 --> 00:02:39.107
- Yeah.
- It's all right.

00:02:39.274 --> 00:02:40.817
- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:43.153
- He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
- Okay.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.362
Hey. You know what?

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:47.866
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:50.452
- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.413
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.956
Ha-ha-ha.

00:02:55.123 --> 00:02:56.833
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.043
- You can edit it.
- Mm-hm.

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.128
- Three, two, one. Hey, May.
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:05.800
My gosh, uh, I wanted to tell you
what an incredible job your nephew did...

00:03:05.967 --> 00:03:09.846
...this weekend at the
Stark internship retreat.

00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:11.014
Everyone was impressed.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.934
Come on!
It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.644
This is because you're
not on Queens Boulevard.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.813
See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.608
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.

00:03:21.775 --> 00:03:23.735
That was a private conversation.

00:03:23.902 --> 00:03:26.279
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.

00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:27.697
No, seriously, was
he snoring a bunch?

00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:29.866
Here we are.
End of the line. Whoops.

00:03:32.035 --> 00:03:33.495
Can you give us a moment?

00:03:33.662 --> 00:03:35.914
- Want me to leave?
- Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.084
I can keep the suit?

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.336
Yes, we were
just talking about it.

00:03:42.712 --> 00:03:45.507
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.

00:03:45.674 --> 00:03:46.675
Don't stress him out.

00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:48.760
Don't do anything stupid.
I've seen his cardiogram.

00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:51.680
- All right?
- Yes.

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:55.225
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

00:03:55.392 --> 00:03:58.353
There's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.771
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.899
- This it?
- Seventh floor.

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:05.485
- I can take that. You don't have to.
- You'll take it?

00:04:05.652 --> 00:04:08.029
- Yeah, I can take that.
- Thank you.

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:11.992
So when's our next, uh--?
When's our next "retreat," you know?

00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:14.786
- What, next mission?
- Yeah, the mission. The missions.

00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:16.788
- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:18.164
No, I mean, we'll call you.

00:04:18.623 --> 00:04:20.500
- Like, someone will call you. All right?
- Oh.

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:22.919
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.

00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:26.923
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.

00:04:29.175 --> 00:04:30.635
Bye.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.559
They're gonna call me.

00:05:57.521 --> 00:05:58.773
What's up, Penis Parker?

00:06:02.318 --> 00:06:04.487
<i>Rise and shine, Midtown
Science and Technology.</i>

00:06:04.653 --> 00:06:06.614
<i>Don't forget about your
homecoming tickets.</i>

00:06:06.781 --> 00:06:08.407
<i>Do you have a date
for homecoming?</i>

00:06:08.574 --> 00:06:10.701
<i>Thanks, Jason, but I
already have a date.</i>

00:06:10.868 --> 00:06:12.828
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:16.082
Morning.

00:06:19.001 --> 00:06:22.588
Ahh, damn it.
You, in my office right now.

00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:39.522
Hi!

00:06:41.816 --> 00:06:43.526
Join me, and together...

00:06:43.692 --> 00:06:45.986
...we'll build my new
LEGO Death Star.

00:06:46.695 --> 00:06:48.906
- What?
- So lame.

00:06:49.073 --> 00:06:50.658
That's awesome. How many pieces?

00:06:50.825 --> 00:06:52.660
Three thousand eight
hundred and three.

00:06:52.827 --> 00:06:56.080
- That's insane.
- I know. You want to build it tonight?

00:06:56.247 --> 00:06:57.790
No, I can't tonight.
I've got the Stark--

00:06:57.957 --> 00:07:00.000
- Mm-hm. Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.

00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:01.419
Always got that internship.

00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:04.505
Yeah, well, hopefully, soon
it'll lead to a real job with them.

00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:06.173
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.718
He'd be all, "Good job on
those spreadsheets, Peter."

00:07:08.884 --> 00:07:10.553
"Here's a gold coin."

00:07:10.886 --> 00:07:13.180
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.

00:07:13.347 --> 00:07:14.890
Oh, heh.

00:07:15.057 --> 00:07:17.101
I'll knock out the bones
of the Death Star.

00:07:17.268 --> 00:07:21.188
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it.

00:07:22.523 --> 00:07:24.817
The top half we can
knock out in two hours, tops.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.820
That'd be great.

00:07:27.987 --> 00:07:29.363
I'm gonna be late.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.866
Okay, so how do we
calculate linear acceleration...

00:07:32.032 --> 00:07:35.119
...between points A and B?

00:07:35.286 --> 00:07:36.328
Flash.

00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:39.540
It's the product of sine of the
angle and gravity divided by mass.

00:07:39.707 --> 00:07:43.002
Nope. Peter. You still with us?

00:07:43.794 --> 00:07:46.005
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah.

00:07:46.172 --> 00:07:47.673
Uh....

00:07:48.174 --> 00:07:50.926
Mass cancels out, so
it's just gravity times sine.

00:07:51.093 --> 00:07:55.264
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.

00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:56.766
You're dead.

00:08:00.686 --> 00:08:04.482
Today we're talking about
Danish physicist Niels Bohr...

00:08:04.648 --> 00:08:07.276
...but trust me, there's
nothing Bohr-ing...

00:08:08.235 --> 00:08:10.738
...about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.

00:08:21.415 --> 00:08:22.750
Did Liz get a new top?

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:26.670
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.

00:08:26.837 --> 00:08:29.673
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.468
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.

00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:33.886
Too late.

00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:35.721
You guys are losers.

00:08:36.472 --> 00:08:38.099
Well, then why
do you sit with us?

00:08:38.265 --> 00:08:39.809
Because I don't
have any friends.

00:08:41.894 --> 00:08:43.813
Next question.

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:46.482
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?

00:08:47.566 --> 00:08:48.734
Hydrogen's the lightest.

00:08:48.901 --> 00:08:50.361
That's not the question. Okay.

00:08:50.528 --> 00:08:51.737
- Yeah.
- Uranium.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.989
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.

00:08:54.156 --> 00:08:56.200
- Yes.
- Please open your books to page 10.

00:08:56.367 --> 00:08:58.577
Peter, it's nationals.

00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:00.955
Is there no way you could
take one weekend off?

00:09:01.122 --> 00:09:05.084
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.

00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:07.628
You've never been in the
same room as Tony Stark.

00:09:07.795 --> 00:09:09.046
Wait. What's happening?

00:09:09.213 --> 00:09:11.173
- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.509
- No, no, no.
- Why not?

00:09:13.676 --> 00:09:15.386
Really? Right before nationals?

00:09:15.553 --> 00:09:17.763
He already quit marching
band and robotics lab.

00:09:19.473 --> 00:09:21.642
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.

00:09:22.017 --> 00:09:24.061
Flash, you're in for Peter.

00:09:24.228 --> 00:09:26.355
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.

00:09:26.522 --> 00:09:28.733
I got a hot date with
Black Widow coming up.

00:09:29.525 --> 00:09:30.693
That is false.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.238
What'd I tell you about using
the bell for comedic purposes?

00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:52.212
- They're topside, sir!
- Tier 1 has LOS!

00:09:54.142 --> 00:09:55.477
We've got all exits covered.

00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:57.631
All right. Stay alert.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.278
I'm sending in alpha squad.

00:10:07.572 --> 00:10:10.784
Natasha Romanoff is in
violation of the Sokovia Accords.

00:10:10.997 --> 00:10:12.916
She assaulted the
king of Wakanda.

00:10:13.091 --> 00:10:14.384
Make an example out of her.

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:22.164
- Yeah?
- Don't do this.

00:10:22.775 --> 00:10:23.776
Do what?

00:10:23.974 --> 00:10:25.810
Come after me.

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:27.902
I mean, you're embarrassing yourself.
It looks desperate.

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:30.879
Thought maybe you'd
be calling me to cut a deal.

00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:33.295
<i>'Cause from my vantage point,</i>

00:10:33.706 --> 00:10:35.082
<i>it's the federal fugitive</i>

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.225
who's desperate.

00:10:36.283 --> 00:10:39.134
<i>From my vantage point, you look
like you could use some bed rest.</i>

00:10:39.684 --> 00:10:41.477
<i>What is this, your
second triple bypass?</i>

00:10:41.627 --> 00:10:43.471
I wouldn't worry about me.

00:10:44.025 --> 00:10:45.890
We got Barton, we got
Wilson and that other guy,

00:10:46.057 --> 00:10:48.322
the incredible
shrinking convict.

00:10:48.494 --> 00:10:51.205
<i>Rogers is on the run.
You got no friends.</i>

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.768
Where you gonna go?

00:10:53.045 --> 00:10:55.381
I've lived a lot of lives
before I met you, Ross.

00:10:55.486 --> 00:10:58.072
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble. I'm done.

00:10:59.455 --> 00:11:00.498
Romanoff?

00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:28.266
Got an empty nest,
Secretary Ross.

00:11:28.433 --> 00:11:30.393
Her tracker, sir.

00:12:53.084 --> 00:12:53.943
You're in my bed.

00:12:54.051 --> 00:12:55.920
I'm... I'm not even
under the covers.

00:12:56.244 --> 00:12:57.370
Did you get
everything on my list?

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.787
Got passports, entry visas,
a couple of local driver's licenses.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.432
Mix and match, you should be able
to stretch it to 20 or so identities.

00:13:07.127 --> 00:13:08.170
Fanny Longbottom?

00:13:08.243 --> 00:13:10.036
- What?
- What, are you 12?

00:13:10.071 --> 00:13:13.658
That is a legitimate name.

00:13:13.742 --> 00:13:16.119
We've got a generator outside.

00:13:16.286 --> 00:13:19.247
It's petrol-powered. And the septic tank
will need a flush in a couple of weeks,

00:13:19.414 --> 00:13:21.082
but, you know, I've got
a guy coming for that.

00:13:21.249 --> 00:13:24.169
You have to haul your rubbish into town.
It's just a 20-minute drive.

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:27.380
I've got your basic hardware
kit stashed under the stairs.

00:13:27.922 --> 00:13:29.049
Nice.

00:13:29.674 --> 00:13:30.967
Are you okay?

00:13:31.259 --> 00:13:32.260
Why wouldn't I be?

00:13:32.427 --> 00:13:35.347
I hear things. You know, something
about the Avengers getting divorced...

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.641
Ugh. It's fine.

00:13:38.466 --> 00:13:39.593
I'm actually better on my own.

00:13:39.712 --> 00:13:40.713
Are you sure?

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:42.270
Yeah.

00:13:42.687 --> 00:13:43.980
Because you can
tell me, you know.

00:13:44.147 --> 00:13:45.815
That's the way the
whole friends thing works.

00:13:45.982 --> 00:13:48.818
I know. I have friends.

00:13:49.486 --> 00:13:51.863
People who have
friends don't call me.

00:13:58.078 --> 00:13:59.996
And I don't pay you to worry.

00:14:15.436 --> 00:14:16.562
Oh, hey.

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:19.121
What's all this junk?

00:14:19.307 --> 00:14:21.977
Oh, just some mail and personals
from the Budapest safe house.

00:14:22.894 --> 00:14:23.895
Budapest?

00:14:24.062 --> 00:14:26.064
Yeah. Budapest.

00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:28.400
- No, it's "Budapest."
- Budapest.

00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:29.651
Budapest.

00:14:29.818 --> 00:14:31.903
- It's "Budapest." Sh.
- Whatever.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.282
I knew you weren't going back there,
so I've got someone else in the flat now.

00:14:35.448 --> 00:14:37.742
Sorry you went through the trouble.
I would've told you to chuck it.

00:14:37.909 --> 00:14:40.036
Well, if you don't want it,
throw it in the rubbish.

00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:12.835
What's going on?

00:15:12.915 --> 00:15:16.475
It's the car. It lost power.
It won't start.

00:15:17.155 --> 00:15:18.715
The car no start.

00:15:19.155 --> 00:15:20.155
What happened?

00:15:20.235 --> 00:15:21.555
The engine failed.

00:15:22.995 --> 00:15:24.235
Ours, too.

00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:30.515
What is it, Captain?

00:15:39.035 --> 00:15:41.515
Defense positions.

00:15:41.595 --> 00:15:42.955
Defense positions.

00:15:43.115 --> 00:15:44.475
Are we under attack?

00:15:44.635 --> 00:15:46.035
Defense positions.

00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:49.355
Get around to the side.

00:15:50.035 --> 00:15:51.395
Defense positions.

00:15:53.955 --> 00:15:55.715
Hey. Defense positions!

00:15:58.595 --> 00:15:59.715
No games.

00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:22.275
What do you see?

00:16:30.755 --> 00:16:32.835
Come in. Come in.

00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:34.355
Over there! Look back!

00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:36.195
Watch out!

00:17:01.995 --> 00:17:03.395
T'Challa, no!

00:17:04.195 --> 00:17:05.835
This one's just a boy.

00:17:07.755 --> 00:17:09.355
He got kidnapped as well.

00:17:09.435 --> 00:17:10.435
Nakia...

00:17:14.835 --> 00:17:15.995
I...

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:19.839
- I wanted...
- Hey!

00:17:20.077 --> 00:17:22.757
I have her! Don't move!
I will shoot!

00:17:22.915 --> 00:17:24.435
I will shoot her right now.

00:17:32.381 --> 00:17:33.421
You froze.

00:17:33.715 --> 00:17:35.195
Ah...

00:17:37.875 --> 00:17:41.035
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.

00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:44.435
My father is dead, Nakia.

00:17:45.835 --> 00:17:48.635
I will be crowned king tomorrow.

00:17:49.755 --> 00:17:51.675
And I wish for you to be there.

00:17:58.715 --> 00:18:00.475
Carry yourselves home now.

00:18:00.555 --> 00:18:01.555
Thank you.

00:18:01.635 --> 00:18:03.155
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:04.595
Thank you oh.

00:18:12.315 --> 00:18:14.435
You will speak
nothing of this day.

00:18:15.197 --> 00:18:16.197
Yes.

00:18:17.006 --> 00:18:18.006
Thank you.

00:18:19.062 --> 00:18:20.062
Thank you.

00:18:55.598 --> 00:18:56.998
Sister Nakia...

00:18:57.398 --> 00:18:58.958
My Prince...

00:18:59.878 --> 00:19:01.398
we are home.

00:19:37.438 --> 00:19:39.318
This never gets old.

00:20:34.478 --> 00:20:35.518
Queen Mother...

00:20:36.278 --> 00:20:37.438
Princess...

00:20:37.838 --> 00:20:39.518
My comfort for your loss.

00:20:39.718 --> 00:20:40.758
Thank you, Nakia.

00:20:40.918 --> 00:20:43.558
It is so good to have
you back with us.

00:20:44.282 --> 00:20:45.282
Take her to the River Province

00:20:45.385 --> 00:20:46.918
to prepare her for the ceremony.

00:20:47.238 --> 00:20:48.438
Yes, General.

00:20:57.558 --> 00:20:58.678
Did he freeze?

00:20:59.158 --> 00:21:01.158
Like an antelope in headlights.

00:21:02.438 --> 00:21:03.758
Are you finished?

00:21:08.478 --> 00:21:10.718
So surprised my
little sister came

00:21:10.798 --> 00:21:12.718
to see me off
before our big day.

00:21:12.918 --> 00:21:13.918
You wish!

00:21:13.998 --> 00:21:16.758
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

00:21:16.918 --> 00:21:19.118
Update? No. It worked perfectly.

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:20.758
How many times do
I have to teach you?

00:21:20.918 --> 00:21:22.118
Just because something works

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:23.918
doesn't mean that it
cannot be improved.

00:21:24.078 --> 00:21:26.238
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

00:21:27.198 --> 00:21:28.558
More than you.

00:21:29.558 --> 00:21:32.198
I can't wait to see what
kind of update you make...

00:21:32.358 --> 00:21:34.238
to your ceremonial outfit.

00:21:35.758 --> 00:21:36.838
Shuri!

00:21:37.518 --> 00:21:38.638
Sorry, Mother!

00:21:39.518 --> 00:21:41.478
How are you feeling today, Mama?

00:21:41.838 --> 00:21:42.998
Proud.

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:47.758
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:51.318
He is with us...

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:54.518
and it is your time to be king.

00:22:12.398 --> 00:22:14.525
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.

00:22:16.527 --> 00:22:17.820
What's up, Mr. Delmar?

00:22:17.987 --> 00:22:19.530
Hey, Mr. Parker.

00:22:19.697 --> 00:22:20.907
Number five, right?

00:22:21.074 --> 00:22:24.577
Yeah, um, and with pickles, and can
you smush it down real flat? Thanks.

00:22:24.744 --> 00:22:26.204
You got it, boss.

00:22:26.371 --> 00:22:27.914
How's your aunt?

00:22:28.331 --> 00:22:29.582
Yeah, she's all right.

00:22:38.299 --> 00:22:40.134
- Ten dollars.
- It's 5 dollars.

00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:44.013
- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.

00:22:44.847 --> 00:22:46.516
Here's 5 dollars.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.559
What's up, Murph?

00:22:49.894 --> 00:22:51.312
How you doing, buddy?

00:22:52.772 --> 00:22:54.565
So how's school?

00:22:54.732 --> 00:22:56.693
Ah, it's boring.
Got better things to do.

00:22:56.859 --> 00:23:00.113
Stay in school, kid. Otherwise,
you're gonna end up like me.

00:23:00.738 --> 00:23:03.825

- Best sandwiches in Queens.

00:24:28.034 --> 00:24:30.453

son of Badu...

00:27:27.765 --> 00:27:29.365
give to you...

00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:31.725
Prince T'Challa...

00:27:31.885 --> 00:27:33.605
the Black Panther!

00:27:38.605 --> 00:27:40.125
The prince...

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:44.885
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther...

00:27:45.085 --> 00:27:47.325

00:28:22.845 --> 00:28:26.765
Victory in ritual combat...

00:28:26.925 --> 00:28:30.485
comes by yield or death.

00:28:30.645 --> 00:28:34.205
If any tribe wishes
to put forth a warrior...

00:28:34.365 --> 00:28:36.205
I now offer...

00:28:36.845 --> 00:28:39.805
a path to the throne.

00:28:43.605 --> 00:28:48.245
The Merchant Tribe
will not challenge today.

00:28:50.205 --> 00:28:54.325
The Border Tribe
will not challenge today.

00:28:57.045 --> 00:29:00.085
The River Tribe
will not challenge today.

00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:05.045
The Mining Tribe
will not challenge today.

00:29:05.245 --> 00:29:08.125
Is there any member
of a royal blood...

00:29:08.925 --> 00:29:12.205
who wishes to
challenge for the throne?

00:29:15.965 --> 00:29:18.765
This corset is really
uncomfortable...

00:29:18.965 --> 00:29:22.205
so could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

00:29:22.845 --> 00:29:23.885
Mother!

00:29:48.765 --> 00:29:50.765
Are they Jabari? Yes.

00:29:59.725 --> 00:30:02.485
M'Baku, what are you doing here?

00:30:04.365 --> 00:30:06.605
It's challenge day.

00:30:11.845 --> 00:30:13.445
We have watched...

00:30:14.285 --> 00:30:16.605
and listened from the mountains!

00:30:16.765 --> 00:30:18.725
We have watched with disgust...

00:30:18.885 --> 00:30:21.685
as your technological
advancements

00:30:21.765 --> 00:30:23.845
have been overseen by a child!

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:29.885
Who scoffs at tradition!

00:30:30.685 --> 00:30:33.565
And now you want
to hand the nation

00:30:33.645 --> 00:30:35.565
over to this prince...

00:30:36.365 --> 00:30:41.685
who could not keep
his own father safe.

00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:45.285
Mmm?

00:30:46.645 --> 00:30:48.365
We will not have it.

00:30:48.525 --> 00:30:52.605
I said, we will not have it, oh!

00:30:52.805 --> 00:30:55.285
I, M'Baku...

00:30:56.765 --> 00:30:58.565
leader of the Jabari...

00:30:58.725 --> 00:31:03.005
I accept your challenge, M'Baku.

00:31:04.285 --> 00:31:06.205
Glory to Hanuman.

00:31:24.285 --> 00:31:26.485
Jabari!

00:31:27.205 --> 00:31:28.205
Dora Milaje!

00:31:36.805 --> 00:31:39.565
Let the challenge begin!

00:31:50.885 --> 00:31:52.205
Oh!

00:31:54.925 --> 00:31:55.925
Stand up!

00:32:05.205 --> 00:32:06.925
Come!

00:32:14.405 --> 00:32:16.485
T'Challa!

00:32:21.605 --> 00:32:23.165
Where is your god now?

00:32:33.565 --> 00:32:35.165
Yes!

00:32:42.925 --> 00:32:44.725
No powers.

00:32:45.085 --> 00:32:46.525
No claws.

00:32:47.965 --> 00:32:49.485
No special suit, oh!

00:32:49.645 --> 00:32:52.685
Just a boy not fit to lead!

00:32:52.885 --> 00:32:55.885
Show him who you are!

00:33:12.325 --> 00:33:14.125
I am Prince T'Challa...

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:15.885
son of King T'Chaka!

00:33:16.085 --> 00:33:17.685
You can do this, T'Challa!

00:33:31.485 --> 00:33:32.485
Yes!

00:33:33.045 --> 00:33:34.045
Come on!

00:33:34.205 --> 00:33:36.365
Yield! Don't make me kill you.

00:33:36.525 --> 00:33:38.125
I would rather die!

00:33:41.565 --> 00:33:42.525
T'Challa!

00:33:43.765 --> 00:33:44.765
T'Challa!

00:33:45.485 --> 00:33:46.525
T'Challa!

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:48.525
T'Challa!

00:33:49.325 --> 00:33:50.365
T'Challa!

00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:51.565
You have fought with honor!

00:33:51.725 --> 00:33:54.325
Now yield! Your people need you.

00:33:54.485 --> 00:33:55.485
T'Challa!

00:33:55.885 --> 00:33:56.885
T'Challa!

00:33:56.965 --> 00:33:58.125
Yield, man!

00:33:58.325 --> 00:33:59.565
T'Challa!

00:33:59.965 --> 00:34:00.965
T'Challa!

00:34:02.805 --> 00:34:05.325
Yes! Yes!

00:34:26.885 --> 00:34:29.485
I now present to you...

00:34:29.645 --> 00:34:31.965
King T'Challa...

00:34:33.685 --> 00:34:36.565
the Black Panther.

00:34:42.565 --> 00:34:43.685
Zuri.

00:34:44.605 --> 00:34:45.805
My King.

00:34:56.485 --> 00:34:58.125
Wakanda forever!

00:34:58.285 --> 00:35:00.365
Wakanda forever!

00:35:06.582 --> 00:35:08.751
<i>You have reached
the voicemail box of:</i>

00:35:08.917 --> 00:35:10.377
<i>Happy Hogan.</i>

00:35:10.544 --> 00:35:12.755
Hey, Happy.
Here's my report for tonight.

00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:14.423
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.093
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note, um....

00:35:18.302 --> 00:35:20.596
I helped this lost,
old Dominican lady.

00:35:20.763 --> 00:35:23.640
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.

00:35:24.266 --> 00:35:26.977
I just, um, feel like
I could be doing more.

00:35:27.144 --> 00:35:30.355
You know? Just curious when
the next real mission's gonna be.

00:35:31.148 --> 00:35:32.816
So, yeah, just call me back.

00:35:32.983 --> 00:35:35.736
It's Peter. Parker.

00:35:40.282 --> 00:35:43.118
Why would I tell
him about the churro?

00:35:46.789 --> 00:35:48.374
Hey, hey. Aah.

00:35:52.461 --> 00:35:54.213
Okay.

00:35:55.714 --> 00:35:58.467
- Can't wait to see this thing.
- Finally, something good.

00:36:01.845 --> 00:36:04.223
Yo, this high-tech
stuff makes it too easy.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.226
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.107
Oh, nice.

00:36:13.273 --> 00:36:15.818
We can hit, like, five
more places tonight.

00:36:27.413 --> 00:36:29.873
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.291
Whoa, you're the Avengers.

00:36:31.875 --> 00:36:33.377
What are you guys doing here?

00:36:35.838 --> 00:36:38.132
Thor. Hulk. Good to
finally meet you guys.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.383
Unh!

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:41.802
I thought you'd be more
handsome in person. Iron Man!

00:36:41.969 --> 00:36:44.888
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.

00:36:47.558 --> 00:36:48.726
Hey--

00:36:48.892 --> 00:36:50.894
Oh, this feels so weird.

00:36:53.522 --> 00:36:54.982
What is that thing?

00:36:55.149 --> 00:36:59.403
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.

00:37:03.365 --> 00:37:05.117
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

00:37:05.284 --> 00:37:09.872
Uh, Spider-Man is fighting the
Avengers in a bank on 21st Street.

00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:11.874
Let's wrap this up.
It's a school night.

00:37:14.877 --> 00:37:16.128
Aah!

00:37:16.295 --> 00:37:18.422
So how do jerks like
you get tech like this?

00:37:20.632 --> 00:37:22.384
No. Wait, wait, wait!

00:37:26.972 --> 00:37:28.307
Mr. Delmar.

00:37:29.975 --> 00:37:33.228
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
Is anybody in here? Hello?

00:37:42.321 --> 00:37:44.239
Oh, come on.

00:37:46.075 --> 00:37:47.117
I gotta--

00:37:48.535 --> 00:37:50.245
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.

00:37:52.206 --> 00:37:53.749
Okay. Good. Yes.

00:37:53.916 --> 00:37:55.292
Yes-- No. No, put that down.

00:37:55.459 --> 00:37:56.794
That's worth more
than you or me.

00:37:58.212 --> 00:38:00.214
- Yeah?
- The craziest thing just happened.

00:38:00.381 --> 00:38:01.840
These guys were
robbing an ATM...

00:38:02.007 --> 00:38:04.218
- ...with high-tech weapons--
- Take a breath. I don't have time...

00:38:04.385 --> 00:38:06.261
- ...for ATM robberies...
<i>- Yeah, but--</i>

00:38:06.428 --> 00:38:09.681
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.

00:38:09.848 --> 00:38:11.558
<i>Everything's gotta
be out next week.</i>

00:38:11.975 --> 00:38:15.354
- Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Yeah, don't you watch the news?

00:38:15.521 --> 00:38:18.816
Tony sold Avengers Tower. We're
relocating to a new facility upstate...

00:38:18.982 --> 00:38:22.194
- ...where hopefully cell service is worse.
- But what about me?

00:38:22.569 --> 00:38:24.113
- What about you?
- Unh!

00:38:24.279 --> 00:38:27.324
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs
me or something big goes down?

00:38:27.825 --> 00:38:30.953
- <i>Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?</i>
- Stay away from anything dangerous.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.872
I'm responsible for making
sure you're responsible, okay?

00:38:35.833 --> 00:38:38.252
I am responsible. I-- Oh, crap.

00:38:38.419 --> 00:38:40.838
- <i>My backpack's gone.</i>
- That doesn't sound responsible.

00:38:41.004 --> 00:38:44.007
- <i>I'll call you back.</i>
- Feel free not to.

00:39:44.276 --> 00:39:46.153
What was that?

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.697
Uh, it's nothing. Nothing.

00:39:48.864 --> 00:39:50.574
You're the Spider-Man.

00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:53.577
- From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not.

00:39:53.744 --> 00:39:56.038
- You were on the ceiling.
- No. What are you doing in my room?

00:39:56.205 --> 00:39:58.123
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:00.501
You can't just
bust into my room!

00:40:00.667 --> 00:40:03.379
Ha-ha. That turkey meatloaf
recipe is a disaster.

00:40:03.545 --> 00:40:06.173
Let's go to dinner. Thai?
Ned, you want Thai?

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.591
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.

00:40:07.758 --> 00:40:10.344
A thing to do after.

00:40:10.719 --> 00:40:12.388
Okay.

00:40:13.305 --> 00:40:15.224
Maybe put on some clothes.

00:40:16.725 --> 00:40:18.727
- Oh, she doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.

00:40:18.894 --> 00:40:21.146
Mr. Stark knows because
he made my suit. That's it.

00:40:21.313 --> 00:40:24.525
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an Avenger?

00:40:25.943 --> 00:40:27.277
Yeah, basically.

00:40:27.486 --> 00:40:28.695
Whoa....

00:40:28.862 --> 00:40:31.740
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.

00:40:31.907 --> 00:40:33.742
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.

00:40:33.909 --> 00:40:36.912
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this.

00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:38.288
Come on, Ned, please.

00:40:38.455 --> 00:40:40.165
Okay, okay, okay.

00:40:40.332 --> 00:40:43.043
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.962
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

00:40:45.129 --> 00:40:47.798
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.

00:40:47.965 --> 00:40:51.719
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I-- Please.

00:40:54.096 --> 00:40:56.765
- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?

00:40:57.224 --> 00:40:58.267
I swear.

00:40:58.434 --> 00:41:00.477
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:41:00.644 --> 00:41:02.563
I can't believe this
is happening now.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:03.981
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.

00:41:04.148 --> 00:41:05.983
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:08.360
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.

00:41:08.527 --> 00:41:10.487
Okay, well, wait, then.

00:41:10.654 --> 00:41:14.158
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?

00:41:15.117 --> 00:41:17.411
This is the Stark internship.

00:41:17.619 --> 00:41:20.622
- Oh.
- Just get out of here.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.835
<i>What's the matter?</i>

00:41:25.419 --> 00:41:26.920
Thought you loved larb.

00:41:27.588 --> 00:41:29.256
It's too larby?

00:41:29.423 --> 00:41:32.134
Not larby enough.

00:41:32.301 --> 00:41:36.889
How many times do I have to
say "larb" before you talk to me?

00:41:37.056 --> 00:41:39.224
You know I larb you.

00:41:39.391 --> 00:41:42.436
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.

00:41:42.603 --> 00:41:43.645
A lot of work.

00:41:43.812 --> 00:41:46.065
The Stark internship.

00:41:46.231 --> 00:41:49.860
I have to tell you, not
a fan of that Tony Stark.

00:41:50.819 --> 00:41:54.281
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.

00:41:54.448 --> 00:41:56.075
<i>Delmar's Sandwiches
was destroyed...</i>

00:41:56.241 --> 00:41:57.534
What does he have you doing?

00:41:57.701 --> 00:41:59.286
<i>- ...in an explosion...</i>
- You need to use your instincts.

00:41:59.453 --> 00:42:02.581
<i>...after an ATM robbery was thwarted
by Queens' own crime stopper...</i>

00:42:02.748 --> 00:42:03.832
What?

00:42:03.999 --> 00:42:05.542
<i>...the Spider-Man.</i>

00:42:05.709 --> 00:42:08.045
<i>As the Spider-Man
attempted to foil their heist...</i>

00:42:08.212 --> 00:42:11.882
<i>...a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.</i>

00:42:12.049 --> 00:42:14.093
<i>Miraculously, no one was harmed.</i>

00:42:14.259 --> 00:42:18.347
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.

00:42:18.514 --> 00:42:20.265
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

00:42:20.432 --> 00:42:21.725
Six blocks away from us.

00:42:21.892 --> 00:42:23.894
I, uh, need a new backpack.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.523
- What?
- I need a new backpack.

00:42:27.981 --> 00:42:29.191
That's five.

00:42:30.401 --> 00:42:32.736
- Sticky rice pudding.
- We didn't order that.

00:42:32.903 --> 00:42:34.738
It's on the house.

00:42:34.947 --> 00:42:36.782
Oh, thanks.

00:42:38.492 --> 00:42:40.828
That's nice of him.

00:42:40.994 --> 00:42:43.872
I think he larbs you, heh.

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:13.330
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:16.650
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:20.730
and take you to
the Ancestral Plane.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:25.290
T'Chaka...

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.490
we call on you.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:31.530
Come here to your son.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:28.890
I'm sorry.

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:30.850
Stand up.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.210
You are a king.

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:11.610
That is not what I
am talking about.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.730
I am not ready
to be without you.

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.890
A man who has not
prepared his children

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:24.530
for his own death...

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.850
has failed as a father.

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:29.570
Have I ever failed you?

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:31.570
Never.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:39.850
Tell me how to best
protect Wakanda.

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:44.570
I want to be a
great king, <i>Baba.</i>

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:47.530
Just like you.

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:50.130
You're going to struggle.

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:52.130
So you'll need to
surround yourself

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:53.930
with people you trust.

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:57.330
You're a good man
with a good heart.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:00.850
And it's hard for a
good man to be king.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:06.650
Breathe.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:09.370
T'Challa, breathe.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:12.490
Breathe.

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:15.050
He was there.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.810
He was there. My father.

00:47:21.728 --> 00:47:23.438
<i>Why did you break
up the encounter</i>

00:47:23.521 --> 00:47:24.606
with my pet python?

00:47:24.689 --> 00:47:27.233
Because I discovered
he had a crush on me.

00:47:30.612 --> 00:47:31.696
<i>Moonraker 1 on
preset launch program...</i>

00:47:31.779 --> 00:47:32.864
Oh, great.

00:47:33.031 --> 00:47:34.490
<i>...minus two minutes.</i>

00:47:35.074 --> 00:47:36.075
<i>Retract crew access...</i>

00:49:15.758 --> 00:49:18.886
I'm pretty sure Ross
has no jurisdiction here.

00:49:21.472 --> 00:49:24.142
And you should know I'm a
better shot when I'm pissed off.

00:50:27.372 --> 00:50:28.957
You're not here for me.

00:52:17.398 --> 00:52:19.192
Oh, shit.

00:53:04.449 --> 00:53:06.727
- Where's the locksmith?
- I called the fire department.

00:53:06.977 --> 00:53:08.617
- Yeah?
- They said they've seen this before.

00:53:08.851 --> 00:53:11.552
- It takes like six or seven hours.
- Oh, my Gosh.

00:53:11.898 --> 00:53:14.320
- We're stuck here for life with him.
- It'll dissolve.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:16.117
You just have to have patience.
