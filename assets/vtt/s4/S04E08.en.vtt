WEBVTT

00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:15.730
So that's it.
You're just gonna run?

00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:20.568
Feds were waiting for us.

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:23.404
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.823
Yeah, I'm running.

00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:27.784
You should too.

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:30.161
You know I can't do that.

00:00:30.328 --> 00:00:31.537
So now what?

00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:36.668
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.836
Seriously?

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.172
Yes. You will not regret this.

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:46.135
You in?

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.237
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:52.031
...so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:54.117
Okay.

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:56.119
All right, get out of here.

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:05.128
Are you expelled?

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:08.298
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?

00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:11.801
Pretty sure that's an urban
myth, and, no, I'm not expelled.

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.637
You're so lucky.

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.145
Hey.

00:02:04.312 --> 00:02:07.440
- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.

00:02:07.607 --> 00:02:09.984
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.

00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:11.861
Hey, look, I, uh--

00:02:12.737 --> 00:02:15.448
I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.

00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:16.699
It's fine.

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:20.912
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.997
No, I'm--

00:02:23.164 --> 00:02:25.166
I just mean that...

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:28.211
...it was not
cool, especially...

00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:31.714
...because...

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:35.552
...I like you.

00:02:36.052 --> 00:02:37.554
I know.

00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:41.224
You do?

00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:44.018
You're terrible at
keeping secrets.

00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:45.854
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

00:02:49.232 --> 00:02:51.526
I got to get to class, but, um--

00:02:51.943 --> 00:02:55.154
I'd say we should hang out, but
I'm gonna be in detention for...

00:02:55.363 --> 00:02:59.284
- Uh-huh.
- ...ever, but, um--

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.786
I guess you already have
a date to homecoming.

00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:06.666
Actually, I was so busy planning it, I
never really got around to that part, so--

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:09.586
Uh, do you want to...

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:10.795
...go with me?

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:13.590
Yeah. Sure.

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:16.384
Really? I mean,
uh, great. Cool.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.177
Cool.

00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:21.264
I'm actually going that way.

00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:23.099
Um....

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.319
May, I need your help.

Tell her she looks nice, but not

00:04:15.902 --> 00:04:16.986

Yeah.

00:04:43.847 --> 00:04:45.390
I'm Liz's dad.

00:04:45.557 --> 00:04:47.058
Put her there.

00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:49.185
Hell of a grip.

00:04:49.352 --> 00:04:51.646
Come on in here. Come on.

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.421
Hi, Peter.

00:05:17.088 --> 00:05:18.673
You look very handsome.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.341
Thank you.

00:05:20.508 --> 00:05:22.635
You got his name right?

00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:24.178
- Freddie?
- Peter.

00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:25.555
- Peter. Peter.
- Heh.

00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:27.682
I'm gonna go get Liz.

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.642
Okay.

00:05:35.607 --> 00:05:36.816
You all right, Pete?

00:05:36.983 --> 00:05:38.109
Yeah.

00:05:38.484 --> 00:05:40.862
Because you look pale.

00:05:42.697 --> 00:05:44.157
You want something to drink?

00:05:44.324 --> 00:05:46.576
A bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?

00:05:46.743 --> 00:05:48.036
I'm not old enough to drink.

00:05:48.578 --> 00:05:49.996
That's the right answer.

00:05:52.123 --> 00:05:53.124
Wow.

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:57.212
- Wow, wow, wow. Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.

00:05:57.378 --> 00:05:58.796
Doesn't she, Pete?

00:05:58.963 --> 00:06:01.341
Yeah, you look really good.

00:06:01.507 --> 00:06:03.718
Once again, that's
the right answer.

00:06:03.885 --> 00:06:05.929
Is that a corsage?

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.182
Thanks.

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.560
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur, so,
uh, let's get this show on the road.

00:06:12.727 --> 00:06:15.897
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.

00:06:16.064 --> 00:06:18.316
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.

00:06:18.483 --> 00:06:19.943
Okay. Come on, you guys.

00:06:20.693 --> 00:06:22.779
Peter, closer.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.406
Smile.

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:28.159
There you go.

00:06:28.743 --> 00:06:29.869
Oh....

00:06:33.957 --> 00:06:37.126
- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.

00:06:37.293 --> 00:06:39.504
I'm going out of town.
It's right on my way.

00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:41.589
- He's always going. Have fun.
- Last time.

00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:43.132
- Thank you.
- Promise.

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:44.717
- He's cute.
- Shh.

00:06:46.803 --> 00:06:49.389
- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.

00:06:49.556 --> 00:06:51.140
Come on, Pedro.

00:06:51.307 --> 00:06:53.226
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.197
- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?

00:07:06.656 --> 00:07:08.408
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?

00:07:08.575 --> 00:07:11.160
- Oh, um, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.

00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:13.913
Just saying, you know.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.832
All you guys who
go to that school...

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:18.418
...you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.129
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:24.716
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.

00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:27.176
- Really? Stark?
- Mm-hm.

00:07:27.343 --> 00:07:29.053
So cool.

00:07:30.096 --> 00:07:31.264
What do you do?

00:07:32.182 --> 00:07:34.642
Yeah, actually, I don't
intern for him anymore.

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:37.812
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got, um...

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:39.022
...boring.

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:42.150
It was boring?
You got to hang out with Spider-Man.

00:07:42.317 --> 00:07:44.235
Really? Spider-Man?

00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:47.280
Wow. What's he like?

00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:49.908
Yeah, he's nice.

00:07:50.074 --> 00:07:51.910
Nice man.

00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:53.912
Solid dude.

00:07:54.537 --> 00:07:55.747
Hmm.

00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:58.917
Look. So cute.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:00.710
Aww....

00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:06.507
I've seen you around,
right? I mean...

00:08:07.258 --> 00:08:08.384
...somewhere. We've, uh--

00:08:08.551 --> 00:08:10.386
Have we ever--?
Because even the voice--

00:08:10.762 --> 00:08:12.889
Um, he does Academic
Decathlon with me.

00:08:13.097 --> 00:08:15.475
- Oh.
- And he was at my party.

00:08:15.642 --> 00:08:18.019
It was a great party,
really great, yeah.

00:08:18.186 --> 00:08:22.398
- Beautiful house, a lot of windows. Heh.
- You were there for, like, two seconds.

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:26.319
That was-- I was there
longer than two seconds.

00:08:26.486 --> 00:08:29.989
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.

00:08:30.156 --> 00:08:34.327
Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.

00:08:41.968 --> 00:08:45.255
That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C., though.

00:08:45.421 --> 00:08:47.048
Were you scared?

00:08:47.882 --> 00:08:50.385
I'll bet you were glad when
your old pal Spider-Man...

00:08:50.552 --> 00:08:52.637
...showed up in the
elevator, though, huh?

00:08:55.431 --> 00:08:57.141
Yeah, well, I
actually didn't go up.

00:08:57.308 --> 00:08:59.060
I saw it all from the ground.

00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:01.396
Yeah.

00:09:01.729 --> 00:09:04.065
Very lucky that he
was there that day.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.779
Good old Spider-Man.

00:09:13.366 --> 00:09:15.285
Dad, the light.

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:32.886
Here we are.
End of the line.

00:09:33.052 --> 00:09:34.470
Thanks, Dad.

00:09:34.929 --> 00:09:36.472
You head in there, gumdrop.

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:39.392
I'm gonna give Peter
the, uh, "dad" talk.

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:43.229
Don't let him intimidate you.

00:09:43.396 --> 00:09:44.606
Love you.

00:09:44.772 --> 00:09:47.233
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.610
Hi.

00:09:49.652 --> 00:09:51.946
You guys look so pretty.

00:09:56.784 --> 00:09:57.827
Does she know?

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.163
Know what?

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.081
So she doesn't. Good.

00:10:02.248 --> 00:10:03.917
Close to the vest.

00:10:04.083 --> 00:10:05.251
I admire that.

00:10:05.418 --> 00:10:07.545
I've got a few
secrets of my own.

00:10:08.171 --> 00:10:12.008
Of all the reasons I didn't
want my daughter to date....

00:10:14.177 --> 00:10:15.595
Peter...

00:10:15.762 --> 00:10:17.972
...nothing is more
important than family.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:19.933
You saved my daughter's life.

00:10:20.099 --> 00:10:21.935
I could never forget
something like that.

00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:23.853
So I'm gonna give
you one chance.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.146
Are you ready?

00:10:25.855 --> 00:10:28.858
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...

00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:32.654
...and don't you ever, ever...

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.406
...interfere with
my business again.

00:10:35.573 --> 00:10:37.492
Because if you do...

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:39.911
...I'll kill you...

00:10:40.078 --> 00:10:41.663
...and everybody you love.

00:10:42.914 --> 00:10:44.749
I'll kill you dead.

00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:47.710
That's what I'll do to protect
my family. Do you understand?

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:51.047
Hey.

00:10:52.382 --> 00:10:55.802
I just saved your life.
Now, what do you say?

00:10:58.012 --> 00:10:59.347
Thank you.

00:10:59.514 --> 00:11:01.266
You're welcome.

00:11:01.432 --> 00:11:06.980
Now, you go on in there and you
show my daughter a good time, okay?

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.607

00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:08.208
What did he say to you?

00:12:10.126 --> 00:12:11.920
<i>♪ I was falling in love ♪♪</i>

00:12:12.462 --> 00:12:13.880
Gotta go.

00:12:15.798 --> 00:12:17.425
I'm sorry.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.719
You don't deserve this.

00:12:52.816 --> 00:12:55.628
<i>Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!</i>

00:14:01.594 --> 00:14:02.595
Are we cool?

00:14:06.265 --> 00:14:07.934
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

00:14:09.227 --> 00:14:10.812
So how long have
you been like that?

00:14:11.229 --> 00:14:12.522
Like what?

00:14:13.272 --> 00:14:16.442
Like this. Big, and
green, and stupid.

00:14:17.568 --> 00:14:19.737
Hulk always Hulk.

00:14:24.367 --> 00:14:25.785
How'd you get here?

00:14:26.577 --> 00:14:27.620
Winning.

00:14:28.413 --> 00:14:29.455
You mean cheating, huh?

00:14:29.622 --> 00:14:31.833
Were they wearing one
of these when you won?

00:14:31.999 --> 00:14:33.292
How'd you arrive here?

00:14:36.254 --> 00:14:37.255
Quinjet.

00:14:37.463 --> 00:14:40.049
Yes. Now, where
is the Quinjet now?

00:14:44.762 --> 00:14:46.764
That's naked.

00:14:46.931 --> 00:14:49.767
He's very naked. Hmm.

00:14:52.395 --> 00:14:54.564
It's in my brain now.

00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:56.441
Quinjet.

00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:08.286
Yes!

00:15:08.453 --> 00:15:09.954
I'm getting us out of here.

00:15:10.121 --> 00:15:12.540
This is a terrible, awful place.

00:15:12.707 --> 00:15:16.419
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

00:15:16.586 --> 00:15:17.962
Hulk stay.

00:15:18.129 --> 00:15:21.549
No, no, no. My people
need me to get back to Asgard.

00:15:22.258 --> 00:15:24.051
We must prevent Ragnarok.

00:15:24.218 --> 00:15:25.386
Ragnarok?

00:15:25.553 --> 00:15:27.513
The prophesied death
of my home world.

00:15:27.597 --> 00:15:28.931
The end of days,
it's the end of...

00:15:30.975 --> 00:15:33.144
If you help me get
back to Asgard...

00:15:33.311 --> 00:15:35.480
I can help you get
back to Earth. Huh?

00:15:35.646 --> 00:15:36.647
Earth hate Hulk.

00:15:36.814 --> 00:15:38.399
Earth loves Hulk.
They love you.

00:15:38.566 --> 00:15:39.859
You're one of the Avengers.

00:15:39.942 --> 00:15:41.277
One of the team,
one of our friends.

00:15:41.944 --> 00:15:43.696
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

00:15:43.863 --> 00:15:45.031
You're Banner's friend.

00:15:45.198 --> 00:15:47.408
I'm not Banner's friend.
I prefer you.

00:15:47.575 --> 00:15:48.576
Banner's friend.

00:15:48.659 --> 00:15:49.660
I don't even like Banner.

00:15:49.786 --> 00:15:52.663
"I'm into numbers
and science and stuff."

00:15:53.081 --> 00:15:54.791
Thor go.
Hulk stay.

00:15:54.957 --> 00:15:55.958
Fine.

00:15:56.667 --> 00:15:57.794
Stay here.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.880
Stupid place.
It's hideous, by the way.

00:16:01.047 --> 00:16:04.509
The red, the white.
Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:06.552
Smash you.

00:16:06.719 --> 00:16:09.013
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.307
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.

00:16:11.474 --> 00:16:13.226
- Baby arms.
- What?

00:16:13.392 --> 00:16:14.560
Baby.

00:16:14.644 --> 00:16:16.187
Moron!
You big child.

00:16:16.354 --> 00:16:17.438
Thor go!

00:16:17.522 --> 00:16:19.357
I am going.

00:16:23.403 --> 00:16:24.862
Thor go again.

00:16:29.534 --> 00:16:30.827
Thor home.

00:16:41.003 --> 00:16:42.588
Hulk trains.

00:16:42.755 --> 00:16:44.841
That's great.
Have fun.

00:16:45.007 --> 00:16:46.634
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.

00:16:46.801 --> 00:16:48.094
What have you been up to?

00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:49.262
Winning.

00:16:59.522 --> 00:17:02.734
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

00:17:04.068 --> 00:17:06.070
I need you to help me.

00:17:08.197 --> 00:17:09.532
Help me see.

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:22.211
I see you, but you're far away.

00:17:23.129 --> 00:17:24.380
What's going on here?

00:17:24.547 --> 00:17:26.090
Come see for yourself.

00:17:28.634 --> 00:17:30.136
I'm providing refuge
in a stronghold

00:17:30.219 --> 00:17:31.429
built by our ancestors.

00:17:31.596 --> 00:17:35.016
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

00:17:35.183 --> 00:17:37.226
You're talking about
evacuating Asgard?

00:17:40.313 --> 00:17:42.440
We won't last long if we stay.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.233
She draws her power from Asgard

00:17:44.317 --> 00:17:45.610
and grows stronger every day.

00:17:45.777 --> 00:17:46.903
Come on.

00:17:50.865 --> 00:17:52.366
Hela is ravenous.

00:17:52.533 --> 00:17:53.659
If I let her leave,

00:17:53.743 --> 00:17:55.578
she'll consume Nine Realms
and all the cosmos.

00:17:55.787 --> 00:17:56.788
We need you.

00:17:56.954 --> 00:17:58.039
I'm working on it.
But I don't even know

00:17:58.122 --> 00:17:59.332
where the hell I am.

00:17:59.499 --> 00:18:01.667
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.

00:18:01.834 --> 00:18:03.753
- Which one?
- The big one.

00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:34.420
He gave you a choice.

00:18:34.587 --> 00:18:36.672
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?

00:18:36.839 --> 00:18:38.507
What's with the crappy costume?

00:18:40.926 --> 00:18:42.136
My web-shooters.

00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:55.649
I wasn't sure about this
thing at first, but damn.

00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:02.198
Ugh. Gross.

00:19:14.126 --> 00:19:16.629
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.

00:19:21.717 --> 00:19:22.968
Nice shot!

00:19:28.307 --> 00:19:29.433
Yes!

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.435
Ned, the guy with
the wings is Liz's dad.

00:19:31.602 --> 00:19:33.479
- What?
- I gotta tell Mr. Stark.

00:19:33.646 --> 00:19:36.482
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.

00:19:36.649 --> 00:19:37.858
Get a computer
and track my phone.

00:19:38.275 --> 00:19:40.027
- Will you be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him...

00:19:40.194 --> 00:19:42.488
...before he leaves town.

00:19:42.655 --> 00:19:44.865
I'm sorry about dinner...

00:19:45.282 --> 00:19:48.577
...but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay? So--

00:19:50.037 --> 00:19:51.622
Flash, I need your
car and phone.

00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:54.542
Uh, sir, technically, this is
my dad's car, sir. So I can't--

00:20:03.134 --> 00:20:05.052
Hello, Ned?
Hey, hey, can you hear me?

00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:07.221
- Go for Ned.
<i>- Ned, I need you...</i>

00:20:07.429 --> 00:20:09.723
- ...to track my phone.
- Yeah, but where is it?

00:20:14.687 --> 00:20:17.064
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.

00:20:17.231 --> 00:20:20.443
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.

00:20:20.609 --> 00:20:22.945
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speakerphone.

00:20:23.112 --> 00:20:26.073
- You stole Flash's car. Awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome. It's--

00:20:27.575 --> 00:20:29.618
Get out of the way,
get out of the way! Move!

00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:31.412
- Are you okay?
- <i>I've never driven before...</i>

00:20:31.579 --> 00:20:35.249
...only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.

00:20:37.251 --> 00:20:38.669
<i>Hey, have you gotten
through to Happy yet?</i>

00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:42.173
Yeah. I'm working on it. I just
gotta backdoor the phone system.

00:20:45.593 --> 00:20:47.303
Guy in the chair.

00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:53.809
<i>Takeoff in nine minutes.</i>

00:20:53.976 --> 00:20:56.145
<i>- Hello? Hello? Who is this?</i>
- Uh....

00:20:56.312 --> 00:20:57.354
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
<i>- Who?</i>

00:20:57.521 --> 00:20:59.815
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something very important to tell you--

00:20:59.982 --> 00:21:01.525
<i>You gotta be shitting me.</i>

00:21:02.234 --> 00:21:03.277
Damn.

00:21:03.444 --> 00:21:05.821
Hey, Ned, how we coming
on with those headlights?

00:21:07.406 --> 00:21:10.242
Round knob to the left of the
steering wheel, turn clockwise.

00:21:10.409 --> 00:21:11.702
Left, okay.

00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:13.662
Okay, perfect. So where's
my phone now?

00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:15.039
Um....

00:21:15.247 --> 00:21:16.832
He stopped in an old
industrial park in Brooklyn.

00:21:16.999 --> 00:21:19.794
What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.380
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.

00:21:23.547 --> 00:21:25.216
It sounded like he
was catching a flight.

00:21:25.382 --> 00:21:26.509
<i>He said something about
taking off in nine minutes.</i>

00:21:26.675 --> 00:21:28.677
- What?
- He was surrounded by boxes.

00:21:28.844 --> 00:21:30.387
Boxes?
It's moving day.

00:21:30.554 --> 00:21:32.515
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.

00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:34.558
I gotta stop him!

00:21:37.728 --> 00:21:39.522
All right, wheels up
in eight minutes.

00:21:39.688 --> 00:21:42.274
We just got to load Tony's
old Hulkbuster armor...

00:21:42.441 --> 00:21:45.861
...prototype for Cap's new
shield, and the Meging--

00:21:46.028 --> 00:21:47.571
The Meg-- The--

00:21:47.738 --> 00:21:48.906
Thor's magic belt.

00:21:50.241 --> 00:21:52.910
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close. It's on your right.

00:21:53.077 --> 00:21:54.328
- What?
<i>- Turn right.</i>

00:22:04.171 --> 00:22:06.465
- Peter. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:22:06.632 --> 00:22:09.051
Just keep trying to
get through to Happy.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.679
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.

00:22:12.346 --> 00:22:14.557
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.

00:22:14.765 --> 00:22:16.350
Uh....

00:22:18.352 --> 00:22:19.395
I'm...

00:22:19.562 --> 00:22:20.855
...looking...

00:22:21.021 --> 00:22:23.190
...at porn.

00:22:40.874 --> 00:22:42.167
Thor sad.

00:22:42.334 --> 00:22:43.542
Shut up.

00:22:45.796 --> 00:22:47.464
Thor sad.

00:22:48.506 --> 00:22:50.300
I'm not sad, you idiot.

00:22:50.716 --> 00:22:52.635
- I'm pissed off!
- Oh.

00:22:53.428 --> 00:22:56.765
Angry.
I lost my father.

00:22:57.224 --> 00:22:59.600
I lost my hammer.

00:22:59.684 --> 00:23:01.311
- You're not even listening.
- Whining and crying.

00:23:01.394 --> 00:23:02.562
Cry like baby.

00:23:02.979 --> 00:23:04.564
Don't kick stuff.

00:23:05.857 --> 00:23:08.026
You're being a
really bad friend.

00:23:08.193 --> 00:23:09.403
You bad friend!

00:23:09.568 --> 00:23:10.778
- You know what we call you?
- No.

00:23:10.946 --> 00:23:12.738
We call you the stupid Avenger.

00:23:12.906 --> 00:23:15.075
You're tiny Avenger!

00:23:17.536 --> 00:23:18.662
What, are you crazy?

00:23:18.745 --> 00:23:19.830
Yes.

00:23:19.912 --> 00:23:22.791
You know what?
Earth does hate you.

00:23:43.103 --> 00:23:45.063
No. Mmm-mmm.

00:23:47.566 --> 00:23:50.568
I'm sorry I said those things.

00:23:50.986 --> 00:23:52.237
You're not the stupid Avenger.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.613
Nobody calls you
the stupid Avenger.

00:23:55.198 --> 00:23:56.658
It's okay.

00:23:56.825 --> 00:23:57.826
You just can't go
around throwing shields

00:23:57.908 --> 00:23:59.244
at people. Could have killed me.

00:23:59.411 --> 00:24:00.620
I know. I'm sorry.

00:24:00.704 --> 00:24:02.122
I just get so
angry all the time.

00:24:02.289 --> 00:24:04.416
Hulk always, always angry.

00:24:04.582 --> 00:24:06.917
I know. We're the
same, you and I.

00:24:07.419 --> 00:24:09.004
We're just a couple
of hot-headed fools.

00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:13.133
Yeah, same. Hulk like
fire, Thor like water.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:15.760
We're kind of both like fire.

00:24:15.927 --> 00:24:17.929
But Hulk like real fire.

00:24:18.972 --> 00:24:21.308
Hulk like raging fire.

00:24:21.475 --> 00:24:23.727
Thor like smoldering fire.

00:24:26.229 --> 00:24:28.065
Hulk, I need you to
do something for me.

00:24:28.148 --> 00:24:29.149
Hmm?

00:24:34.654 --> 00:24:36.156
Angry girl.

00:24:43.497 --> 00:24:45.749
What's going on? What are you...

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.635
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell...

00:24:56.802 --> 00:24:58.136
when someone's
hiding all the way across

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.638
the universe and
wants to be left alone.

00:24:59.805 --> 00:25:02.432
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.

00:25:03.183 --> 00:25:04.226
I need her to stay.

00:25:04.393 --> 00:25:05.394
Stay?

00:25:06.019 --> 00:25:07.145
Block.

00:25:08.605 --> 00:25:09.648
Stay.

00:25:10.524 --> 00:25:12.359
- Please.
- Please.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.071
All right.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.075
Here's the deal.

00:25:20.659 --> 00:25:22.369
I'll listen to you...

00:25:23.078 --> 00:25:24.454
till this is empty.

00:25:25.914 --> 00:25:28.166
Asgard is in danger
and people are dying.

00:25:28.333 --> 00:25:29.918
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

00:25:30.419 --> 00:25:31.420
Wow.

00:25:31.962 --> 00:25:33.880
Finished. Bye.

00:25:35.507 --> 00:25:36.883
Odin is dead.

00:25:40.262 --> 00:25:42.514
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.

00:25:43.306 --> 00:25:45.892
If Hela's back, then
Asgard's already lost.

00:25:46.059 --> 00:25:47.561
I'm going to stop her.

00:25:48.311 --> 00:25:49.396
- Alone?
- Nope.

00:25:49.563 --> 00:25:50.939
I'm putting together a team.

00:25:51.106 --> 00:25:53.859
It's me, you, and the big guy.

00:25:54.234 --> 00:25:56.445
No. No team. Only Hulk.

00:25:56.611 --> 00:25:58.280
It's me and you.

00:25:58.447 --> 00:25:59.573
I think it's only you.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.950
Wait. Just listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.

00:26:02.117 --> 00:26:04.578
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

00:26:05.328 --> 00:26:06.329
I'm not getting dragged into

00:26:06.413 --> 00:26:07.581
another one of Odin's
family squabbles.

00:26:08.165 --> 00:26:09.916
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.

00:26:10.083 --> 00:26:12.002
Her power comes from
Asgard, same as yours.

00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:13.378
When it grew
beyond Odin's control

00:26:13.462 --> 00:26:14.671
she massacred everyone
in the palace...

00:26:14.838 --> 00:26:16.339
and tried to seize the throne.

00:26:16.757 --> 00:26:18.467
When she tried to escape
her banishment...

00:26:18.633 --> 00:26:21.011
he sent the Valkyrie
in to fight her back.

00:26:22.179 --> 00:26:24.306
I only survived because...

00:26:25.891 --> 00:26:27.309
Look, I already faced her once

00:26:27.392 --> 00:26:29.269
back when I believed
in the throne...

00:26:29.436 --> 00:26:30.687
and it cost me everything.

00:26:31.063 --> 00:26:32.814
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

00:26:32.981 --> 00:26:35.025
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

00:26:35.192 --> 00:26:36.485
I agree.

00:26:37.402 --> 00:26:38.820
Don't get familiar.

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:40.655
I agree.

00:26:40.822 --> 00:26:42.324
That's why I turned
down the throne.

00:26:42.491 --> 00:26:44.326
But this isn't about the crown.

00:26:44.409 --> 00:26:45.619
This is about the people.

00:26:45.786 --> 00:26:47.788
They're dying and
they're your people, too.

00:26:47.954 --> 00:26:49.206
Forget it.

00:26:50.248 --> 00:26:51.625
I have.

00:26:51.792 --> 00:26:53.001
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:26:53.168 --> 00:26:54.211
- Good. Great.
- Great.

00:26:54.294 --> 00:26:55.462
Thank you.

00:26:55.629 --> 00:26:57.297
- For what?
- For this.

00:26:59.007 --> 00:27:00.842
Didn't see that, did you?

00:27:02.344 --> 00:27:04.471
There... That's better.

00:27:06.223 --> 00:27:07.974
You know, go ahead.

00:27:08.141 --> 00:27:12.646
Stay here and enslave
people for that lunatic.

00:27:12.813 --> 00:27:14.189
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

00:27:14.356 --> 00:27:15.565
But me...

00:27:17.651 --> 00:27:19.361
I choose to run
toward my problems

00:27:19.444 --> 00:27:20.779
and not away from them.

00:27:21.863 --> 00:27:23.115
Because that's what...

00:27:28.161 --> 00:27:30.288
Because that's what heroes do.

00:27:41.758 --> 00:27:43.176
Friend stay!

00:27:55.188 --> 00:27:56.523
Yes!

00:28:10.996 --> 00:28:11.997
All right.

00:28:16.043 --> 00:28:17.044

00:29:47.759 --> 00:29:49.344
You all right, Banner?

00:29:51.763 --> 00:29:53.640
Sun's going down.
Sun's going down.

00:29:54.057 --> 00:29:55.475
That's it, breathe.

00:29:55.976 --> 00:29:58.103
I won't hurt you.

00:29:58.687 --> 00:29:59.771
Sun's going down.

00:29:59.938 --> 00:30:01.356
- Thor.
- Yeah.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.567
What happened to your hair?

00:30:03.734 --> 00:30:05.068
Some creepy old man cut it off.

00:30:05.235 --> 00:30:06.695
- It looks good.
- Oh, thanks.

00:30:06.862 --> 00:30:09.197
Where are we?
Oh, how's Nat?

00:30:09.531 --> 00:30:12.325
- Uh, Nat is good, I'm sure.
- Is she okay?

00:30:12.534 --> 00:30:14.286
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?

00:30:14.453 --> 00:30:15.954
The city, Sokovia.
Did we save it?

00:30:16.121 --> 00:30:17.289
- Banner, listen.
- What?

00:30:17.456 --> 00:30:19.458
Sokovia. Ultron.
That was two years ago.

00:30:19.624 --> 00:30:21.126
- What are you saying?
- Well...

00:30:21.293 --> 00:30:22.419
What?

00:30:23.211 --> 00:30:24.629
I've been Hulk for two years?

00:30:24.963 --> 00:30:26.465
I'm afraid so.

00:30:32.429 --> 00:30:33.638

00:30:37.059 --> 00:30:38.727

Who's that?

00:31:11.593 --> 00:31:13.220
He kind of runs the place.

00:31:14.012 --> 00:31:15.347
You actually lived at
his house for awhile.

00:31:15.514 --> 00:31:16.556
- I did?
- Yeah.

00:31:16.723 --> 00:31:18.642
Quite a lot's happened.
You and I had a fight recently.

00:31:19.351 --> 00:31:21.228
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.

00:31:21.395 --> 00:31:22.396
Doesn't sound right.

00:31:22.479 --> 00:31:23.522
Well, it's true.

00:31:23.605 --> 00:31:25.649
<i>It seems that that
criminally seductive</i>

00:31:25.732 --> 00:31:28.276
<i>Lord of Thunder
has stolen him away.</i>

00:31:28.443 --> 00:31:30.946
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.

00:31:31.697 --> 00:31:32.698
Oh, no.

00:31:34.574 --> 00:31:35.701
This is bad.

00:31:35.867 --> 00:31:37.911
This is really, really bad.

00:31:40.622 --> 00:31:44.334
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.

00:31:44.668 --> 00:31:45.711
No, no, no.

00:31:45.877 --> 00:31:47.796
Don't freak out.
You're okay. Put these on.

00:31:47.963 --> 00:31:49.005
These are Tony's clothes.

00:31:49.172 --> 00:31:50.465
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?

00:31:50.632 --> 00:31:52.509
No, he's not here. But listen.
Just stay calm, okay?

00:31:52.676 --> 00:31:54.761
The sun's going down.
The sun's getting really low.

00:31:54.845 --> 00:31:56.054
Sun's going down.

00:32:03.645 --> 00:32:05.522
I'm upset!

00:32:08.525 --> 00:32:10.402
I'm very upset.

00:32:10.569 --> 00:32:12.654
You know what I like about being upset?
The blame.

00:32:12.821 --> 00:32:14.948
Right now, that's the
mindset that I'm in.

00:32:15.032 --> 00:32:16.199
And you know who I'm blaming?

00:32:16.366 --> 00:32:17.909
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!

00:32:17.993 --> 00:32:18.994
Don't interrupt me!

00:32:19.202 --> 00:32:20.287
Here you go.

00:32:20.996 --> 00:32:22.414
Why are you handing
me the melt stick?

00:32:22.581 --> 00:32:24.416
He was interrupting.

00:32:24.583 --> 00:32:26.334
That's not a capital violation.

00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:27.878
Where was I?

00:32:28.253 --> 00:32:30.714
My precious champion
has come up missing...

00:32:30.881 --> 00:32:32.841
and it's all because
of that Lord of Thunder.

00:32:32.924 --> 00:32:35.218
It's all because of him.
Your brother.

00:32:35.385 --> 00:32:38.305
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated.

00:32:38.472 --> 00:32:39.473
I'm sure there's a big history.

00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:40.807
And your contender...

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.601
My dear friend...

00:32:42.768 --> 00:32:44.644
if you were to give me 12 hours,

00:32:44.728 --> 00:32:46.063
I could bring them both
back to you. Alive.

00:32:46.229 --> 00:32:47.731
I could do it in two.

00:32:48.607 --> 00:32:49.691
I could do it in one.

00:32:49.858 --> 00:32:50.901
Let's stop there.

00:32:51.068 --> 00:32:52.861
You know what?
I woke up this morning

00:32:52.944 --> 00:32:55.113
thinking about a
public execution.

00:32:55.697 --> 00:32:56.823
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.785
"Who's gonna get him first?"

00:33:01.036 --> 00:33:03.372
So, you're on the clock.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:06.416
What have you done?

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.751
I don't answer to you, lackey.

00:33:07.959 --> 00:33:08.960
It's Loki.

00:33:09.044 --> 00:33:10.712
And you will answer
to the Grandmaster.

00:33:11.755 --> 00:33:13.507
Hmm.

00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:16.718
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

00:33:16.885 --> 00:33:18.261
I don't help anyone.

00:33:24.768 --> 00:33:25.894
You're a Valkyrie.

00:33:30.816 --> 00:33:33.026
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

00:33:34.194 --> 00:33:35.904
Choose your next words wisely.

00:33:36.071 --> 00:33:39.366
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:10.252
Hey!

00:35:11.795 --> 00:35:13.172
Surprised?

00:35:13.339 --> 00:35:15.216
Oh, hey, Pete.

00:35:15.925 --> 00:35:17.218
I didn't hear you come in.

00:35:17.384 --> 00:35:19.470
It's over. I've got you.

00:35:19.637 --> 00:35:21.639
You know, I gotta
tell you, Pete...

00:35:22.223 --> 00:35:25.142
...I really, really
admire your grit.

00:35:26.727 --> 00:35:27.895
I see why Liz likes you.

00:35:30.105 --> 00:35:32.024
I do. When you first
came to the house...

00:35:32.191 --> 00:35:35.319
...I wasn't sure. I thought,
"Really?" But I get it now.

00:35:36.153 --> 00:35:37.905
How could you do this to her?

00:35:38.072 --> 00:35:40.074
To her? I'm not doing
anything to her, Pete.

00:35:40.241 --> 00:35:42.576
I'm doing this for her.

00:35:42.785 --> 00:35:44.119
Hm. Yeah.

00:35:48.165 --> 00:35:49.625
Peter...

00:35:50.501 --> 00:35:51.544
...you're young.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:53.963
You don't understand
how the world works.

00:35:54.129 --> 00:35:56.882
But I understand that selling
weapons to criminals is wrong.

00:35:57.049 --> 00:35:59.802
How do you think your buddy
Stark paid for that tower?

00:35:59.969 --> 00:36:01.428
Or any of his little toys?

00:36:01.595 --> 00:36:03.347
Those people, Pete,
those people up there...

00:36:03.514 --> 00:36:05.808
...the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.

00:36:05.975 --> 00:36:07.726
Guys like us...

00:36:07.893 --> 00:36:09.770
...like you and me...

00:36:09.937 --> 00:36:11.397
...they don't care about us.

00:36:11.564 --> 00:36:14.024
We build their roads,
and we fight all their wars...

00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:16.485
...and everything, but
they don't care about us.

00:36:16.652 --> 00:36:20.823
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.

00:36:22.074 --> 00:36:24.076
That's how it is.

00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:26.537
I know you know what
I'm talking about, Peter.

00:36:26.704 --> 00:36:28.455
Why are you telling me this?

00:36:28.622 --> 00:36:31.083
Because I want
you to understand.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.668
And...

00:36:32.835 --> 00:36:35.838
...I needed a little time
to get her airborne.

00:36:48.809 --> 00:36:49.852
I'm sorry, Peter.

00:36:53.189 --> 00:36:56.984
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.

00:36:57.443 --> 00:36:59.695
True. Then again...

00:36:59.862 --> 00:37:01.572
...wasn't really trying to.

00:37:07.328 --> 00:37:08.954
<i>Chief, they're
powering up engines.</i>

00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:11.957
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
<i>- Come on, come on, come on.</i>

00:37:40.354 --> 00:37:42.940
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

00:37:44.108 --> 00:37:45.359
The sun's going down.

00:37:45.442 --> 00:37:47.027
- It's getting real low.
- Oh, shoot.

00:37:47.194 --> 00:37:49.321
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?

00:37:49.488 --> 00:37:50.656
I just need you to stay calm.

00:37:50.823 --> 00:37:52.741
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

00:37:52.908 --> 00:37:54.660
It's just a planet.
You've been on a planet before.

00:37:54.827 --> 00:37:55.869
Yeah. One.

00:37:56.036 --> 00:37:57.663
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:59.039
It's a new experience.

00:37:59.206 --> 00:38:01.125
My neurons,
they're firing faster

00:38:01.208 --> 00:38:03.293
than my brain can
handle the information.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.712
The whole thing is
totally different this time.

00:38:05.879 --> 00:38:07.631
In the past, I always
felt like Hulk and I

00:38:07.714 --> 00:38:09.174
each had a hand on the wheel.

00:38:09.341 --> 00:38:11.051
But this time,
it's like he had the keys

00:38:11.135 --> 00:38:12.761
to the car and I was
locked in the trunk.

00:38:12.928 --> 00:38:14.763
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.014
No, it's not what matters.

00:38:16.181 --> 00:38:17.224
What I'm trying
to tell you, is that

00:38:17.307 --> 00:38:18.934
if I turn into the Hulk again...

00:38:19.101 --> 00:38:20.602
Banner may never come back.

00:38:20.769 --> 00:38:22.020
And we're stranded on a planet

00:38:22.104 --> 00:38:24.064
that is designed
to stress me out.

00:38:24.231 --> 00:38:25.357
We're not stranded.

00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:26.775
I'm gonna figure out
a way to get us home.

00:38:27.151 --> 00:38:28.152
Thank you.

00:38:28.318 --> 00:38:30.529
Not your home, though.
Asgard. My home.

00:38:30.696 --> 00:38:31.739
What?

00:38:31.905 --> 00:38:33.699
Listen, my people
are in great danger.

00:38:34.116 --> 00:38:36.368
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

00:38:36.535 --> 00:38:38.370
who also happens
to be my sister.

00:38:38.537 --> 00:38:40.247
Okay, that is so
wrong on so many...

00:38:40.414 --> 00:38:41.540
I don't wanna fight your sister.

00:38:41.623 --> 00:38:42.916
That's a family issue.

00:38:43.083 --> 00:38:44.460
No, she's an evil being.

00:38:44.626 --> 00:38:46.003
I don't care what she is.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:48.505
I'm not fighting any more
beings. I'm sick of it.

00:38:48.672 --> 00:38:49.757
- What?
- I just told you.

00:38:49.923 --> 00:38:51.425
If I turn into the Hulk,

00:38:51.508 --> 00:38:52.718
I am never gonna
come back again.

00:38:52.885 --> 00:38:53.927
And you don't care.

00:38:54.094 --> 00:38:55.888
No, no. I'm putting
together the team.

00:38:56.055 --> 00:38:57.389
The Hulk is the fire.

00:38:57.556 --> 00:38:59.308
Wait, you're just using
me to get to the Hulk.

00:38:59.475 --> 00:39:01.018
- What? No!
- It's gross.

00:39:01.185 --> 00:39:02.936
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

00:39:03.103 --> 00:39:04.855
No! I don't even like the Hulk.

00:39:04.938 --> 00:39:06.190
He's all like...

00:39:06.356 --> 00:39:07.858
"Smash, smash, smash."

00:39:08.025 --> 00:39:09.234
I prefer you.

00:39:10.027 --> 00:39:11.070
Thanks.

00:39:11.779 --> 00:39:13.322
But if I'm being honest,

00:39:13.405 --> 00:39:14.865
when it comes to
fighting evil beings...

00:39:15.032 --> 00:39:16.450
he is very powerful and useful.

00:39:16.617 --> 00:39:18.577
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

00:39:18.744 --> 00:39:19.870
Is he though?

00:39:20.037 --> 00:39:22.164
How many PhDs does Hulk have?
Zero.

00:39:22.331 --> 00:39:24.249
How many PhDs does Banner have?
Seven.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.002
Fine, you don't have
to fight anyone.

00:39:27.169 --> 00:39:29.129
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:34.134
What are you doing with that?

00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:35.302
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

00:39:35.386 --> 00:39:37.221
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.

00:39:37.888 --> 00:39:39.598
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

00:39:39.765 --> 00:39:41.517
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

00:39:41.683 --> 00:39:44.144
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

00:39:44.311 --> 00:39:45.604
Then why did you
dress me up like Tony?

00:39:45.771 --> 00:39:46.772
Because you were naked.

00:39:46.939 --> 00:39:48.315
Okay, I'll give you that.

00:39:48.982 --> 00:39:50.109
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

00:39:50.275 --> 00:39:51.735
Tony wears his
pants super tight.

00:39:51.819 --> 00:39:52.861
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

00:39:53.028 --> 00:39:55.155
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.

00:39:55.322 --> 00:39:57.658
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

00:39:57.825 --> 00:40:00.411
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

00:40:00.577 --> 00:40:02.246
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

00:40:02.413 --> 00:40:04.790
You're good. Calm down.
Come on.

00:40:04.957 --> 00:40:06.417
Listen, we're gonna
go to Asgard...

00:40:06.583 --> 00:40:07.584
and you're not gonna
have to think about

00:40:07.668 --> 00:40:08.710
the Hulk ever again.

00:40:09.128 --> 00:40:10.170
- All right?
- All right.

00:40:14.007 --> 00:40:15.676
Hulk!

00:40:17.636 --> 00:40:19.304
Oh. This is bad.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:24.768
Banner! Banner!

00:40:28.772 --> 00:40:29.898
Banner!

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:44.663
Banner!

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.290
Thor!

00:40:57.718 --> 00:40:58.761
Hi.

00:40:58.844 --> 00:40:59.845
Hi.

00:41:00.012 --> 00:41:01.221
I was gonna do that.

00:41:01.388 --> 00:41:02.681
Yeah, well, I did it first.

00:41:02.848 --> 00:41:04.850
That's good.
What are you doing here?

00:41:05.726 --> 00:41:07.352
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

00:41:07.519 --> 00:41:08.520
I got sidetracked.

00:41:09.063 --> 00:41:10.230
What's with the...

00:41:10.397 --> 00:41:11.648
It's my disguise.

00:41:11.815 --> 00:41:12.900
But I can see your face.

00:41:13.233 --> 00:41:14.985
Not when I do this, you can't.

00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:17.362
Your hair looks nice.
I like what you did with it.

00:41:17.446 --> 00:41:19.073
Change it?
Washed it maybe?

00:41:25.037 --> 00:41:26.330
What are those
things on her eyes?

00:41:26.413 --> 00:41:27.831
Are those the people
that she's killed?

00:41:27.998 --> 00:41:29.500
She's so beautiful and
strong and courageous.

00:41:29.583 --> 00:41:30.584
Who is this guy?

00:41:30.751 --> 00:41:31.752
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?

00:41:31.919 --> 00:41:33.337
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.

00:41:33.504 --> 00:41:35.714
I feel like I know you, too.

00:41:40.094 --> 00:41:41.970
Look, I've spent
years in a haze,

00:41:42.054 --> 00:41:43.222
- trying to forget my past.
- Mmm.

00:41:43.639 --> 00:41:44.932
Sakaar seemed
like the best place

00:41:45.015 --> 00:41:47.351
to drink and forget,
and to die one day.

00:41:47.518 --> 00:41:49.353
I was thinking that
you drink too much,

00:41:49.436 --> 00:41:50.813
and that probably
was gonna kill you.

00:41:50.979 --> 00:41:52.064
I don't plan to stop drinking.

00:41:52.481 --> 00:41:54.400
- Oh.
- But I don't wanna forget.

00:41:54.566 --> 00:41:56.193
I can't turn away anymore...

00:41:57.236 --> 00:41:59.029
so if I'm gonna die...

00:41:59.196 --> 00:42:00.781
well, it may as well
be driving my sword

00:42:00.864 --> 00:42:02.366
through the heart of
that murderous hag.

00:42:02.533 --> 00:42:04.118
- Good.
- Yeah.

00:42:04.284 --> 00:42:07.287
So, I'm saying that I
wanna be on the team.

00:42:07.871 --> 00:42:09.123
Has it got a name?

00:42:09.289 --> 00:42:12.084
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

00:42:12.251 --> 00:42:13.252
Revengers?

00:42:13.419 --> 00:42:15.921
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

00:42:17.673 --> 00:42:19.049
Do you want revenge?

00:42:19.133 --> 00:42:21.385
I'm undecided.

00:42:21.552 --> 00:42:22.553
Okay.

00:42:23.137 --> 00:42:24.972
Also, I've got a peace offering.

00:42:28.225 --> 00:42:30.227
Surprise.

00:42:35.816 --> 00:42:37.067
Ow.

00:42:37.151 --> 00:42:38.610
Just had to be sure.

00:42:42.239 --> 00:42:43.407
Hello, Bruce.

00:42:44.742 --> 00:42:46.618
So, last time I saw you,

00:42:46.702 --> 00:42:47.828
you were trying
to kill everybody.

00:42:47.995 --> 00:42:49.204
Where are you at these days?

00:42:49.663 --> 00:42:51.540
It varies from moment to moment.

00:42:52.624 --> 00:42:54.168
Is that a Dragonfang?

00:42:54.334 --> 00:42:55.419
It is.

00:42:55.586 --> 00:42:56.754
My God.

00:42:57.629 --> 00:42:59.798
This is the famed
sword of the Valkyrie.

00:43:00.257 --> 00:43:01.842
Sakaar and Asgard
are about as far apart

00:43:01.925 --> 00:43:03.093
as any two known systems.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.888
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

00:43:06.055 --> 00:43:08.057
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.683
in 18 months.

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:13.103
Nope. We are going
through the big one.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:14.396
The Devil's Anus?

00:43:14.563 --> 00:43:15.689
Anus?

00:43:15.856 --> 00:43:16.857
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

00:43:17.024 --> 00:43:18.025
For the record, I didn't know

00:43:18.108 --> 00:43:19.109
it was called that
when I picked it.

00:43:19.193 --> 00:43:20.986
That looks like a
collapsing neutron star...

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.530
inside of an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

00:43:23.697 --> 00:43:24.948
We need another ship.

00:43:25.032 --> 00:43:26.492
That would tear mine to pieces.

00:43:26.658 --> 00:43:28.202
She's right. We need
one that can withstand

00:43:28.285 --> 00:43:29.495
the geodetic strain
from the singularity.

00:43:29.661 --> 00:43:31.413
And has an offline
power steering system...

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.333
that could also function
without the on-board computer.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.793
And we need one
with cup holders,

00:43:35.876 --> 00:43:37.586
because we're gonna die.
So, drinks!

00:43:37.753 --> 00:43:39.671
Do I know you?
I feel like I know you.

00:43:39.838 --> 00:43:41.715
I feel like I know you,
too. It's weird.

00:43:41.882 --> 00:43:43.008
What do you say?

00:43:43.175 --> 00:43:44.259
Uncharted metagalactic travel

00:43:44.343 --> 00:43:45.636
through a volatile
cosmic gateway.

00:43:45.803 --> 00:43:47.012
Talk about an adventure.

00:43:47.596 --> 00:43:49.264
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.

00:43:49.431 --> 00:43:50.432
There are one or two ships.

00:43:50.516 --> 00:43:51.600
Absolute top of
the line models...

00:43:51.683 --> 00:43:53.143
I don't mean to impose...

00:43:56.397 --> 00:43:58.107
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.275
I may even have stolen

00:44:00.359 --> 00:44:02.236
the access codes to
his security system.

00:44:02.403 --> 00:44:03.404
And suddenly you're overcome

00:44:03.487 --> 00:44:04.738
with an urge to
do the right thing.

00:44:04.822 --> 00:44:05.823
Heavens, no.

00:44:05.989 --> 00:44:07.491
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster...

00:44:07.658 --> 00:44:09.618
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship...

00:44:09.785 --> 00:44:11.386
I'm asking for safe passage…

00:44:11.765 --> 00:44:12.936
through the Anus.

00:44:13.205 --> 00:44:14.540
You're telling us
that you can get us

00:44:14.623 --> 00:44:15.791
access into the garage...

00:44:15.958 --> 00:44:17.709
without setting off any alarms?

00:44:17.876 --> 00:44:19.545
Yes, brother. I can.

00:44:19.711 --> 00:44:22.464
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.

00:44:22.631 --> 00:44:24.299
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago...

00:44:24.466 --> 00:44:26.969
and he was totally
ready to kill any of us.

00:44:27.136 --> 00:44:28.303
He did try to kill me.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.305
Yes, me too.
On many, many occasions.

00:44:30.472 --> 00:44:32.057
There was one time
when we were children...

00:44:32.224 --> 00:44:33.684
he transformed
himself into a snake,

00:44:33.767 --> 00:44:34.977
and he knows that I love snakes.

00:44:35.144 --> 00:44:36.979
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

00:44:37.146 --> 00:44:38.564
and he transformed
back into himself

00:44:38.647 --> 00:44:39.857
and he was like,
"Yeah, it's me!"

00:44:40.023 --> 00:44:43.026
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

00:44:43.527 --> 00:44:44.611
If we're boosting a ship...

00:44:44.778 --> 00:44:46.363
we're gonna need to draw some
guards away from the palace.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:47.948
Why not set the beast loose?

00:44:48.031 --> 00:44:49.074
Shut up.

00:44:49.241 --> 00:44:50.325
You guys have a beast?

00:44:50.492 --> 00:44:52.870
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

00:44:53.078 --> 00:44:54.580
We're going to
start a revolution.

00:44:54.759 --> 00:44:56.344
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.

00:44:56.534 --> 00:44:58.828
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.129
Is that some sort of protoplasm,

00:45:02.212 --> 00:45:03.422
all the stuff that's
coming out of you...

00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:04.882
or are they eggs?

00:45:06.175 --> 00:45:07.426
Looks like eggs.

00:45:09.303 --> 00:45:10.763
Oh!

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:18.228
I'm looking for Korg.

00:45:18.395 --> 00:45:19.688
Who's asking?

00:45:19.855 --> 00:45:21.023
I know you're asking.

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:23.192
Is anyone else asking,
or is it just you?

00:45:23.358 --> 00:45:25.569
The Lord of Thunder
sends his best.

00:45:29.073 --> 00:45:31.158
The revolution has begun.

00:45:31.408 --> 00:45:33.452
Revolution? How did this happen?

00:45:33.619 --> 00:45:35.120
Don't know.

00:45:35.287 --> 00:45:36.705
But the arena's mainframe

00:45:36.789 --> 00:45:38.457
for the Obedience Disks
have been deactivated...

00:45:38.624 --> 00:45:40.501
and the slaves have
armed themselves.

00:45:40.584 --> 00:45:42.753
Oh. I don't like that word.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.213
Which? Mainframe?

00:45:44.379 --> 00:45:46.465
No. Why would I
not like "mainframe"?

00:45:46.632 --> 00:45:48.675
No, the "S" word.

00:45:48.842 --> 00:45:51.595
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.

00:45:53.013 --> 00:45:54.348
Okay, that's better.

00:46:00.437 --> 00:46:02.272
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.

00:46:03.774 --> 00:46:04.817
I disagree.

00:46:05.192 --> 00:46:08.112
Open communication
was never our family's forte.

00:46:08.278 --> 00:46:09.405
You have no idea.

00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:12.199
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

00:46:12.282 --> 00:46:13.283
Hello.

00:46:14.243 --> 00:46:15.285
Hi.

00:46:22.543 --> 00:46:24.169
Odin brought us together.

00:46:24.962 --> 00:46:27.798
It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.

00:46:33.846 --> 00:46:35.973
We might as well
be strangers now.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:39.351
Two sons of the
crown, set adrift.

00:46:39.435 --> 00:46:41.437
Oh.

00:46:42.312 --> 00:46:43.856
Thought you didn't
wanna talk about it.

00:46:45.441 --> 00:46:46.442
Here's the thing.

00:46:46.608 --> 00:46:48.402
I'm probably better off
staying here on Sakaar.

00:46:48.569 --> 00:46:50.279
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

00:46:52.156 --> 00:46:53.574
Did you just agree with me?

00:46:53.741 --> 00:46:55.325
Come on, this place
is perfect for you.

00:46:55.492 --> 00:46:57.161
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

00:46:57.327 --> 00:46:58.996
Brother, you're
gonna do great here.

00:46:59.163 --> 00:47:00.873
Do you truly think
so little of me?

00:47:02.958 --> 00:47:04.710
Loki, I thought
the world of you.

00:47:05.794 --> 00:47:08.380
I thought we were gonna
fight side by side forever.

00:47:08.547 --> 00:47:11.675
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

00:47:12.092 --> 00:47:14.553
I don't know, maybe
there's still good in you.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.888
But let's be honest,

00:47:15.971 --> 00:47:18.223
our paths diverged
a long time ago.

00:47:22.895 --> 00:47:23.937
Yeah.

00:47:25.105 --> 00:47:26.190
It's probably for the best

00:47:26.273 --> 00:47:27.483
that we never see
each other again.

00:47:27.649 --> 00:47:28.942
That's what you always wanted.

00:47:33.155 --> 00:47:34.865
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

00:47:35.032 --> 00:47:36.033
- What?
- "Get Help."

00:47:36.116 --> 00:47:37.117
No.

00:47:37.201 --> 00:47:38.202
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.

00:47:38.285 --> 00:47:39.286
It's great. It works every time.

00:47:39.369 --> 00:47:40.996
- It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan?

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.414
- No.
- We're doing it.

00:47:42.748 --> 00:47:44.541
We are not doing "Get Help."

00:47:45.042 --> 00:47:46.835
Get help! Please!

00:47:47.002 --> 00:47:48.045
My brother, he's dying.

00:47:48.212 --> 00:47:50.214
Get help! Help him!

00:47:52.257 --> 00:47:53.509
Classic.

00:47:53.592 --> 00:47:54.968
Still hate it.

00:47:55.135 --> 00:47:57.471
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.

00:47:57.638 --> 00:47:59.807
Now, which one's the
ship she told us to get?

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:00.891
The Commodore.

00:48:01.392 --> 00:48:02.393
Right.

00:48:05.437 --> 00:48:08.023
Though I feel it won't
make much of a difference.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:11.944
Oh, Loki.

00:48:13.112 --> 00:48:14.446
I know I've betrayed
you many times before...

00:48:14.613 --> 00:48:16.281
but this time it's
truly nothing personal.

00:48:16.448 --> 00:48:18.283
The reward for your capture

00:48:18.367 --> 00:48:19.535
will set me up nicely.

00:48:19.701 --> 00:48:21.328
Never one for sentiment,
were you?

00:48:21.495 --> 00:48:22.955
Easier to let it burn.

00:48:23.288 --> 00:48:24.289
I agree.

00:48:32.756 --> 00:48:34.383
Oh, that looks painful.

00:48:35.092 --> 00:48:37.928
Oh, dear brother, you're
becoming predictable.

00:48:38.095 --> 00:48:40.097
I trust you, you betray me.

00:48:40.264 --> 00:48:42.307
Round and round
in circles we go.

00:48:42.474 --> 00:48:44.476
See, Loki, life is
about, it's about growth.

00:48:44.643 --> 00:48:45.853
It's about change.

00:48:46.019 --> 00:48:49.231
But you seem to just
wanna stay the same.

00:48:49.773 --> 00:48:51.400
I guess what
I'm trying to say...

00:48:51.567 --> 00:48:54.528
is that you'll always
be the God of Mischief...

00:48:54.695 --> 00:48:56.196
but you could be more.

00:48:58.657 --> 00:49:00.659
I'll just put this
over here for you.

00:49:00.826 --> 00:49:04.329
Anyway, all got places
to be, so good luck.

00:49:40.251 --> 00:49:42.045
Okay, ready?

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:52.931
Hello?

00:49:55.308 --> 00:49:56.768
Hello!

00:49:56.935 --> 00:49:58.520
Please, hey.

00:49:58.937 --> 00:50:01.231
Hey, please.
I'm down here.

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:03.358
I'm down here.
I'm stuck.

00:50:03.525 --> 00:50:06.319
I'm stuck.
I can't move. I can't--

00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:27.173
<i>If you're nothing without this
suit, then you shouldn't have it.</i>

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:34.889
Come on, Peter.

00:50:35.056 --> 00:50:36.599
Come on, Spider-Man.

00:50:36.766 --> 00:50:38.727
Come on, Spider-Man.

00:50:38.893 --> 00:50:41.104
Come on, Spider-Man.

00:50:42.981 --> 00:50:45.358
Come on, Spider-Man!

00:51:36.534 --> 00:51:38.036
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.

00:51:38.411 --> 00:51:40.080
Oh, yeah.

00:51:54.969 --> 00:51:57.263
Retroreflective panels engaged.

00:52:09.275 --> 00:52:12.195
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.

00:52:12.362 --> 00:52:15.031
<i>It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.</i>

00:52:27.752 --> 00:52:30.922
<i>Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.</i>

00:52:40.432 --> 00:52:42.183
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:52:42.517 --> 00:52:44.936
Deploying high-altitude
vacuum seal.

00:52:45.103 --> 00:52:46.354
This better work, Mason.

00:52:52.193 --> 00:52:55.238
<i>Trust me, boss, even one of those
boxes and we are set for life.</i>

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:56.698
Yeah.

00:53:09.127 --> 00:53:10.587
<i>You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit...</i>

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:12.547
<i>...and override their security.</i>

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:25.643
Cloning transponder signal.

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:27.479
Launching decoy drone.

00:53:28.938 --> 00:53:30.523
Whoa.

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:33.735
Entering new coordinates.

00:53:39.741 --> 00:53:40.909
Good, so it's on its way.

00:53:41.076 --> 00:53:43.912
- Yes, sir, right on course.
- Okay, thank you.

00:53:44.746 --> 00:53:46.164
All right.

00:53:58.677 --> 00:54:00.303
Hot dog.

00:54:49.936 --> 00:54:51.771
Just a typical homecoming...

00:54:51.938 --> 00:54:54.649
...on the outside
of an invisible jet...

00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.068
...fighting my girlfriend's dad.

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:07.305
Oh, God!

00:55:15.295 --> 00:55:16.732
I can't believe that worked.

00:55:53.875 --> 00:55:56.127
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.

00:55:56.294 --> 00:55:57.420
I'm not going home empty-handed.

00:56:07.722 --> 00:56:09.516
Oh, my God.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:26.866
<i>- Get out. What are you doing?</i>
- Please turn, please turn!

00:58:01.836 --> 00:58:03.546
Hey, Pedro.

00:58:50.969 --> 00:58:52.012
Bingo.

00:59:08.194 --> 00:59:09.988
Your wingsuit.

00:59:10.155 --> 00:59:12.240
Your wingsuit's
going to explode!

00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:21.082
Time to go home, Pete.

00:59:21.249 --> 00:59:22.709
I'm trying to save you!

00:59:37.932 --> 00:59:39.309
No.

00:59:39.976 --> 00:59:41.519
No.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:27.806
All right, I can
figure this out.

01:01:27.973 --> 01:01:29.933
It's just another spaceship.

01:01:43.155 --> 01:01:44.531
<i>Loyal Sakaarians...</i>

01:01:44.698 --> 01:01:46.658
<i>Lord of Thunder
has stolen my ship</i>

01:01:46.742 --> 01:01:48.243
<i>and my favorite champion.</i>

01:01:49.661 --> 01:01:52.831
<i>Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.</i>

01:01:52.998 --> 01:01:54.791
<i>Do not let him
leave this planet.</i>

01:02:07.763 --> 01:02:09.222
- Good shot!
- Thanks.

01:02:11.933 --> 01:02:13.143
<i>Open the doors.</i>

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:14.728
Okay.

01:02:19.858 --> 01:02:21.735
I hope that you're
tougher than you look.

01:02:21.902 --> 01:02:22.944
Why?

01:02:35.415 --> 01:02:37.250
Shouldn't we be shooting
back or something?

01:02:37.334 --> 01:02:38.335
Yes, we should.

01:02:38.543 --> 01:02:40.420
Where are the guns on this ship?

01:02:40.587 --> 01:02:41.963
<i>There aren't any.</i>

01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:43.715
- It's a leisure vessel.
<i>- What?</i>

01:02:43.882 --> 01:02:45.425
Grandmaster uses
it for his good times,

01:02:45.509 --> 01:02:46.718
orgies and stuff.

01:02:46.885 --> 01:02:48.261
Did she just say the Grandmaster

01:02:48.345 --> 01:02:49.471
uses it for orgies?

01:02:49.638 --> 01:02:50.847
Yeah.

01:02:51.014 --> 01:02:52.432
Don't touch anything.

01:03:12.744 --> 01:03:13.745
No!

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.083
- No!
- No!

01:03:25.048 --> 01:03:26.133
Get inside!

01:03:26.299 --> 01:03:27.968
In a minute.

01:03:39.313 --> 01:03:41.189
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

01:03:41.356 --> 01:03:42.858
No. I don't know how
to fly one of these.

01:03:43.025 --> 01:03:44.735
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.

01:03:44.901 --> 01:03:48.196
None of them are for
flying alien spaceships!

01:04:22.606 --> 01:04:23.649
Okay, come on.

01:04:23.732 --> 01:04:25.859
There's gotta be
a gun on this thing.

01:04:26.026 --> 01:04:27.069
That looks like a gun.

01:04:28.195 --> 01:04:29.613
<i>♪ It's my birthday</i>

01:04:29.696 --> 01:04:30.822
<i>♪ It's my birthday</i>

01:04:31.573 --> 01:04:32.616
<i>♪ It's my birthday</i>

01:04:40.666 --> 01:04:41.958
Yeah!

01:04:59.267 --> 01:05:01.520
Guys, we're coming
up on the Devil's Anus!

01:05:08.276 --> 01:05:09.277
There she is.

01:05:09.444 --> 01:05:11.488
Our ticket out of here.

01:05:11.947 --> 01:05:13.240
Hey, what's this?

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.204
Thank you.

01:05:19.287 --> 01:05:21.790
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

01:05:21.957 --> 01:05:22.958
You wanna come?

01:05:23.458 --> 01:05:26.086
You do seem like

01:05:26.169 --> 01:05:27.796
you're in desperate
need of leadership.

01:05:27.963 --> 01:05:29.506
Why, thank you.

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.344
Here we go.

01:05:40.934 --> 01:05:41.935
Shit.

01:06:03.586 --> 01:06:05.505
It looked so insane.
That whole--

01:06:05.672 --> 01:06:07.006
Like, it was just crazy.

01:06:07.173 --> 01:06:08.341
He-- He was just, like:

01:06:09.717 --> 01:06:11.719
- And you were like, "Aah!"
- Shh.

01:06:11.886 --> 01:06:13.763
And then I just hit him
with the: whoosh.

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:15.807
It was so-- Oh, my God.

01:06:15.974 --> 01:06:17.976
I mean, you saved me.

01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:19.936
It was awesome.

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.652
Hey, Liz.

01:06:29.153 --> 01:06:30.321
I'm gonna miss you.

01:06:30.822 --> 01:06:32.407
Bye.

01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:34.492
Liz.

01:06:41.332 --> 01:06:42.542
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

01:06:43.585 --> 01:06:46.588
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?

01:06:48.006 --> 01:06:49.048
The dance?

01:06:50.383 --> 01:06:53.136
That, um, was a pretty
crappy thing to do.

01:06:53.553 --> 01:06:54.637
Well, yeah, but I--

01:06:54.804 --> 01:06:57.640
I mean, your dad-- I can't imagine
what you're going through.

01:06:57.807 --> 01:06:59.976
If there's anything
I can do to help....

01:07:00.143 --> 01:07:02.645
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

01:07:02.812 --> 01:07:06.065
Mom says it's nice there,
so that's cool.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:11.070
Anyways, Dad doesn't want
us here during the trial. So....

01:07:12.488 --> 01:07:15.158
Liz, I-- I--

01:07:15.325 --> 01:07:16.993
Bye, Peter.

01:07:17.869 --> 01:07:21.372
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.

01:07:33.885 --> 01:07:37.430
Congratulations, decathlon
national champions.

01:07:37.597 --> 01:07:39.641
- Yeah!
- Ha-ha.

01:07:39.807 --> 01:07:42.227
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...

01:07:42.393 --> 01:07:44.896
...but just for motivation
right now at this practice.

01:07:45.063 --> 01:07:46.731
I'm ahead of the game,
but we will need...

01:07:46.898 --> 01:07:48.441
...a new team captain next year.

01:07:48.608 --> 01:07:51.277
So I am appointing Michelle.

01:07:52.278 --> 01:07:53.947
Yeah!

01:07:56.157 --> 01:07:57.367
Uh, thank you.

01:07:57.534 --> 01:07:58.993
My-- My friends call me MJ.

01:07:59.619 --> 01:08:01.663
I thought you didn't
have any friends.

01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:03.748
I didn't.

01:08:08.628 --> 01:08:10.630
- I, uh, gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?

01:08:13.341 --> 01:08:15.468
What are you hiding, Peter?

01:08:17.762 --> 01:08:19.347
I'm just kidding.
I don't care. Bye.

01:08:19.514 --> 01:08:22.183
- All right, so we should run some drills.
- Yeah.

01:08:30.608 --> 01:08:33.945
Hey, Happy. What, uh--?
What are you doing here?

01:08:34.904 --> 01:08:36.155
I really owe you one.

01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:40.535
I don't know what I
would do without this job.

01:08:40.702 --> 01:08:42.495
I mean, before I met Tony--

01:09:12.317 --> 01:09:14.319
So, uh, how long you been here?

01:09:14.485 --> 01:09:16.654
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.

01:09:17.614 --> 01:09:20.491
- Is he here too?
- In the toilet? No, he's upstate.

01:09:21.034 --> 01:09:22.535
Upstate-- Like,
"upstate" upstate?

01:09:22.702 --> 01:09:24.287
Yeah, let's go.

01:09:53.355 --> 01:09:56.399
- You don't see that every day.
- Oh, there they are.

01:09:57.067 --> 01:09:58.693
How was the ride up?

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.823
- Good.
- Give me a minute with the kid.

01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:04.409
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:06.202
I gotta talk to the kid.

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:07.871
I'll be close behind.

01:10:08.038 --> 01:10:11.791
How about a loose follow? All right?
Boundaries are good.

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:18.006
Sorry I took your suit.

01:10:18.173 --> 01:10:20.675
You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...

01:10:20.842 --> 01:10:22.844
...the perfect tough-love
moment that you needed.

01:10:23.011 --> 01:10:25.847
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?

01:10:26.014 --> 01:10:27.807
- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:32.896
- Mr. Stark, I really--
- You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:35.190
But then you did
the right thing.

01:10:35.357 --> 01:10:38.526
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies....

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:40.570
All right, not my best analogy.

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:43.698
I was wrong about you.

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:46.493
I think, with a little
more mentoring...

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:49.120
...you could be a
real asset to the team.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.749
- To the--? To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:55.961
...there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.

01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:58.296
When you're ready...

01:10:58.672 --> 01:11:00.382
...why don't you try that on?

01:11:00.549 --> 01:11:04.469
And I'll introduce the world to the
newest official member of the Avengers:

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:06.304
Spider-Man.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:09.766
I....

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:14.271
Yeah, give that a look.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.945
After the press conference,
Happy will show you to your room...

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:23.196
...your new quarters.

01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:25.615
Where's he between?
He's next to Vision?

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:28.034
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.536
Or walls.

01:11:29.703 --> 01:11:31.580
You'll fit right in.

01:11:38.003 --> 01:11:40.005
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:41.715
But I'm good.

01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:45.260
You're good? Good--?
How are you good?

01:11:45.427 --> 01:11:49.598
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:51.933
Friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man.

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.060
Somebody's got to look
out for the little guy, right?

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:55.979
You're turning me down?

01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:58.231
You better think about this.
Look at that.

01:11:58.398 --> 01:11:59.649
Look at me.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.484
Last chance. Yes or no?

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:02.944
- No.
- Okay.

01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:06.615
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.

01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:08.783
Uh, Happy will take you home.

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.452
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:10.619 --> 01:12:12.787
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.

01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:17.000
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:18.877
- See you around.
- Okay.

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:28.303
That was a test, right?

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:31.556
- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.

01:12:32.432 --> 01:12:35.310
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.

01:12:35.477 --> 01:12:37.187
Yeah, thank you.

01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:41.149
Told you he's a good kid.

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:48.865
- Where's the kid?
- He left.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:51.952
- Everybody's waiting.
- He actually made a mature choice.

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:55.121
- It just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you screw this up?

01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:57.374
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding?

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.709
I have a room full of people
in there waiting...

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.670
...for some big announcement.
What will I tell them?

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:04.339
Think of something.
How about, um...?

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.050
- Hap, you still got that ring?
- Do I--? I--?

01:13:07.217 --> 01:13:08.385
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?

01:13:08.552 --> 01:13:11.763
I've been carrying
this since 2008.

01:13:14.432 --> 01:13:15.559
Okay.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.310
I think I can think of
something better than that.

01:13:17.477 --> 01:13:19.854
Well, it would
buy us a little time.

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:23.275
Like we need time.

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:25.110
I can't believe you
have that in your pocket.

01:13:25.277 --> 01:13:27.779
- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.

01:13:43.962 --> 01:13:46.423
Aunt May, did you
do dinner already?

01:13:56.683 --> 01:13:58.351
May?

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:21.166
What the fu--?!

01:15:22.733 --> 01:15:24.694
Look who it is.

01:15:26.612 --> 01:15:29.782
What are the odds you and I'd
end up at the same summer camp?

01:15:29.949 --> 01:15:31.242
Relax.

01:15:31.867 --> 01:15:33.869
This? It's not on you.

01:15:34.036 --> 01:15:37.123
It's on our, uh,
little spider friend.

01:15:37.289 --> 01:15:40.876
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.

01:15:41.043 --> 01:15:44.505
You know, take a picture, slice
his throat, put his head in a dryer.

01:15:45.047 --> 01:15:47.299
And I heard a rumor.

01:15:50.553 --> 01:15:52.138
You know who he is.

01:15:55.891 --> 01:15:58.227
If I knew who he was...

01:15:58.394 --> 01:15:59.979
...he'd already be dead.

01:16:04.525 --> 01:16:07.403
Toomes, your family's here!

01:16:19.924 --> 01:16:20.925
Oh, boy.

01:16:27.557 --> 01:16:29.392
Oh.

01:16:29.476 --> 01:16:33.605
I just gotta say,
I'm proud of you all.

01:16:33.772 --> 01:16:37.192
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!

01:16:37.275 --> 01:16:39.736
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.

01:16:39.819 --> 01:16:42.197
Come on. No?

01:16:42.614 --> 01:16:44.657
Me too. 'Cause I've been
a big part of it.

01:16:44.741 --> 01:16:47.535
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:49.704
So, you're welcome.

01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:52.207
And, uh, it's a tie.
