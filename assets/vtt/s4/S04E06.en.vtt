WEBVTT

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:26.055
You know what they say...

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:29.255
"You're out of luck
until you've gone duck."

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:57.335
Yondu!

00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:00.095
Come on down!

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:13.895
After going around
years in circles...

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:15.895
with this woman I
end up marrying.

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:18.735
I said, "Aleta,
I love you, girl...

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:20.295
"but you're losing your mind!"

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.455
Then again, she's
always been that way.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.375
I could never trust her.
You know?

00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:25.655
Stakar.

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:31.615
It's been some time.

00:01:35.655 --> 00:01:37.575
It seems like this establishment

00:01:37.695 --> 00:01:39.655
is the wrong kind
of disreputable.

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:46.775
Sir! Stakar!

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.175
There's a hundred
Ravager factions.

00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:52.375
You lost the business of
99 of them by serving one.

00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:54.095
Please, sir. Please!

00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:55.615
Get away from me.

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:03.735
You can go to hell then!

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:06.175
I don't give a damn
what you think of me!

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:08.295
So what are you
following us for?

00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:09.895
Because you're gonna
listen to what I gotta say!

00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:11.415
I don't gotta listen to nothing!

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:12.775
You betrayed the code!

00:02:12.935 --> 00:02:14.775
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:17.855
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:18.935
You didn't know because

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:20.615
you didn't want to know
because it made you rich.

00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:22.855
I demand a seat at the table!

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:25.095
I wear these flames,
same as you.

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:27.255
You may dress like us...

00:02:27.415 --> 00:02:28.615
but you'll never hear
the Horns of Freedom

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:29.895
when you die, Yondu.

00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:31.935
And the Colors of Ogord...

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.535
will never flash
over your grave.

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:38.095
If you think...

00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:42.455
I take pleasure
in exiling you...

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:45.975
you're wrong.

00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:50.055
You broke all our hearts.

00:03:04.695 --> 00:03:06.975
Ah, pathetic.

00:03:08.095 --> 00:03:10.135
First, Quill betrays us...

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:13.575
and Yondu just
lets him go scot-free.

00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:16.855
We followed him
because he was the one...

00:03:17.015 --> 00:03:19.535
who wasn't afraid to do
what needed to be done.

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:22.055
Seems he's goin' soft.

00:03:22.495 --> 00:03:25.015
If he's so soft, why
are you whispering?

00:03:25.575 --> 00:03:27.415
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:31.975
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.

00:03:32.135 --> 00:03:33.695
Who the hell is that?

00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:15.455
Yondu Udonta...

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.295
I have a proposition for you.

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:58.125
Is this your king? Huh?

00:04:58.672 --> 00:05:00.032
Come on, Brother!

00:05:00.332 --> 00:05:01.113
No!

00:05:08.047 --> 00:05:09.589
No!

00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:27.735
The Queen Mother
and Shuri, they are safe?

00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:29.108
Yes.

00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:33.288
We should get to
them immediately.

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:36.215
What?

00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:37.815
Though my heart is with you.

00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:41.535
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man

00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:43.295
who showed up
here only hours ago.

00:05:43.415 --> 00:05:44.415
He is of royal blood.

00:05:44.535 --> 00:05:46.815
He killed T'Challa!
In ritual combat.

00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:48.815
Does that really matter?

00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:54.375
You are the greatest
warrior Wakanda has.

00:05:54.775 --> 00:05:58.535
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

00:05:58.695 --> 00:05:59.815
Overthrow?

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:01.855
Nakia!

00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:06.095
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

00:06:07.855 --> 00:06:12.295
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:14.655
What are you loyal to?

00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:19.575
I loved him.

00:06:20.975 --> 00:06:23.255
I loved my country, too.

00:06:23.455 --> 00:06:25.495
Then you serve your country.

00:06:25.655 --> 00:06:28.815
No. I save my country.

00:06:37.815 --> 00:06:38.855
What's wrong?

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:40.615
The king is dead.

00:06:42.015 --> 00:06:43.935
Come with me, unless
you want to join him.

00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:05.255
First <i>Baba.</i>

00:07:06.775 --> 00:07:08.375
And now my brother.

00:07:11.215 --> 00:07:14.015
Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:24.255
It's me. Nakia. Who is this man?

00:07:24.415 --> 00:07:26.255
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

00:07:27.415 --> 00:07:28.455
Where's Okoye?

00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:29.615
Okoye is not coming.

00:07:29.775 --> 00:07:32.535
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

00:07:38.455 --> 00:07:39.815
Wait here.

00:07:43.455 --> 00:07:46.215
What has happened
to our Wakanda?

00:07:48.615 --> 00:07:50.735
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:53.855
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:56.815
and take you to
the Ancestral Plane.

00:09:31.975 --> 00:09:34.735
What did I tell you about
going into my things?

00:09:35.135 --> 00:09:36.135
Hmm?

00:09:42.055 --> 00:09:44.335
What did you find?

00:09:45.255 --> 00:09:46.695
Your home.

00:09:49.015 --> 00:09:52.055
I gave you a key hoping
that you might see it someday.

00:09:53.975 --> 00:09:56.095
Yes. The sunsets there

00:09:56.175 --> 00:09:57.975
are the most
beautiful in the world.

00:10:00.335 --> 00:10:02.375
But I fear you still
may not be welcome.

00:10:05.135 --> 00:10:06.135
Why?

00:10:08.295 --> 00:10:09.935
They will say you are lost.

00:10:10.535 --> 00:10:12.215
But I'm right here.

00:10:16.135 --> 00:10:18.975
No tears for me?

00:10:22.895 --> 00:10:24.495
Everybody dies.

00:10:26.575 --> 00:10:28.295
It's just life around here.

00:10:32.735 --> 00:10:34.655
Well, look at what I have done.

00:10:36.215 --> 00:10:38.735
I should've taken
you back long ago.

00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:43.975
Instead, we are
both abandoned here.

00:10:49.095 --> 00:10:51.655
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.

00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:56.095
That's why they can't find us.

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:05.495
Breathe! Breathe,
My King, breathe.

00:11:05.695 --> 00:11:08.055
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:26.655
The Heart-Shaped Herb did that?

00:11:29.695 --> 00:11:30.735
This all of it?

00:11:30.895 --> 00:11:32.775
Yes. So when it comes
time for another king,

00:11:32.855 --> 00:11:34.015
we will be ready.

00:11:34.655 --> 00:11:35.935
Another king?

00:11:38.055 --> 00:11:40.175
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.

00:11:40.335 --> 00:11:42.935
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...

00:11:46.575 --> 00:11:49.535
When I tell you to do something,
I mean that shit.

00:11:53.455 --> 00:11:55.015
Burn it all!

00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:29.682
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

00:12:36.939 --> 00:12:40.359
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn...

00:12:40.484 --> 00:12:42.736
the commander of
the Legions of Asgard...

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:44.655
the rightful heir to the throne,

00:12:44.738 --> 00:12:46.282
and the Goddess of Death.

00:12:50.953 --> 00:12:53.455
My father is dead.

00:12:53.747 --> 00:12:55.499
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.585
We were once the seat

00:12:57.668 --> 00:12:59.545
of absolute power in the cosmos.

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.922
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

00:13:02.214 --> 00:13:05.175
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

00:13:05.467 --> 00:13:08.762
Our destiny is to
rule over all others.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.725
And I am here to
restore that power.

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:15.895
Kneel before me...

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.940
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

00:13:21.609 --> 00:13:23.277
Whoever you are...

00:13:23.485 --> 00:13:26.405
whatever you've done,
surrender now!

00:13:26.697 --> 00:13:28.782
Or we will show you no mercy.

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.492
Whoever I am?

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:33.162
Did you listen to a word I said?

00:13:33.454 --> 00:13:35.331
This is your last warning!

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.668
I thought you'd be
happy to see me.

00:13:45.382 --> 00:13:46.717
Fine.

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:01.315
Charge!

00:14:55.494 --> 00:14:57.621
Oh, I've missed this.

00:14:57.705 --> 00:14:59.456
Still, it's a shame.

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:02.418
Good soldiers
dying for nothing...

00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:04.670
all because they
couldn't see the future.

00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:06.380
Sad.

00:15:06.588 --> 00:15:09.591
Oh, look, still alive.

00:15:17.266 --> 00:15:18.851
Change of heart?

00:15:19.268 --> 00:15:21.520
Go back to whatever
cave you crept out of.

00:15:23.063 --> 00:15:24.273
You evil demoness!

00:15:28.318 --> 00:15:30.237
Let's go see my palace.

00:16:40.735 --> 00:16:42.255
<i>I love this song.</i>

00:17:11.775 --> 00:17:13.015
Huh?

00:17:14.015 --> 00:17:15.375
There!

00:17:26.935 --> 00:17:27.935
Ah...

00:18:35.655 --> 00:18:38.215
Ain't so tough now
without all your toys...

00:18:38.375 --> 00:18:40.495
are you?

00:18:42.535 --> 00:18:43.615
Move!

00:19:00.415 --> 00:19:01.575
Crap.

00:19:07.055 --> 00:19:08.455
Hey there, rat!

00:19:08.615 --> 00:19:11.095
How's it going, you blue idiot?

00:19:11.495 --> 00:19:13.575
Not so bad.

00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:16.095
We got ourselves a
pretty good little gig here.

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:19.095
This golden gal with quite
a high opinion of herself...

00:19:19.255 --> 00:19:23.175
has offered us a large sum to
deliver you and your pals over to her...

00:19:23.335 --> 00:19:24.335
because she wants

00:19:24.415 --> 00:19:26.055
to kill y'all.

00:19:26.095 --> 00:19:27.335
Your friend...

00:19:27.495 --> 00:19:29.095
There's too many of them.

00:19:29.255 --> 00:19:32.495
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

00:19:32.695 --> 00:19:35.455
you need to get me
out of these bonds.

00:19:35.935 --> 00:19:37.855
They are going to kill him!

00:19:38.015 --> 00:19:40.135
I tell you, it was
pretty easy to find you.

00:19:40.335 --> 00:19:42.255
I put a tracer on
your ship back there...

00:19:42.455 --> 00:19:43.815
during the war over Xandar.

00:19:44.335 --> 00:19:46.695
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...

00:19:46.775 --> 00:19:48.775
and I'll tell you where
the batteries are.

00:19:49.615 --> 00:19:52.015
Lucky for you,
my word don't mean squat.

00:19:52.455 --> 00:19:54.775
Otherwise, I'd actually
hand you over.

00:19:54.975 --> 00:19:56.335
Otherwise, you'd what?

00:19:57.455 --> 00:19:58.775
We'll take them batteries.

00:19:58.975 --> 00:20:02.535
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?

00:20:02.735 --> 00:20:05.055
That Priestess
offered us a million.

00:20:05.215 --> 00:20:07.895
A quarter is only
one third of that!

00:20:08.055 --> 00:20:09.295
A quarter ain't a third.

00:20:09.335 --> 00:20:11.175
A quarter is 25.

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:12.375
No.

00:20:12.495 --> 00:20:14.895
We can't even buy a
pair of boots with 25 units.

00:20:14.975 --> 00:20:15.975
Enough!

00:20:16.055 --> 00:20:18.535
The point is, we
ain't stupid enough

00:20:18.615 --> 00:20:20.975
to help kill the
Guardians of the Galaxy!

00:20:21.415 --> 00:20:23.855
The whole dang Nova
Corps would be on us.

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:25.975
That ain't right!

00:20:26.695 --> 00:20:29.815
I just gotta say it this
one time, Captain.

00:20:29.975 --> 00:20:32.255
No matter how many
times Quill betrays you...

00:20:32.415 --> 00:20:35.255
you protect him like none
of the rest of us much matter!

00:20:35.415 --> 00:20:36.495
Yeah!

00:20:36.575 --> 00:20:38.095
I'm the one what
sticks up for you!

00:20:38.175 --> 00:20:39.215
Take it easy, Kraglin.

00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:41.895
Damn straight, lad.
He's gone soft.

00:20:42.055 --> 00:20:45.175
Suppose it's time for
a change in leadership.

00:20:50.175 --> 00:20:52.455
Put your damn guns down!

00:20:52.655 --> 00:20:53.855
Whoa! Whoa!

00:20:54.015 --> 00:20:57.535
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

00:20:57.695 --> 00:21:00.535
Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.

00:21:19.575 --> 00:21:21.255
Well, hello, boys.

00:21:26.935 --> 00:21:28.655
It's not ripe.

00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:39.166
Does no one remember me?

00:21:39.959 --> 00:21:42.211
Has no one been
taught our history?

00:21:48.008 --> 00:21:49.343
Look at these lies.

00:21:50.177 --> 00:21:51.512
Goblets and garden parties?

00:21:53.889 --> 00:21:55.432
Peace treaties?

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.476
Odin...

00:21:57.726 --> 00:21:59.228
proud to have it...

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.771
ashamed of how he got it.

00:22:20.207 --> 00:22:22.334
We were unstoppable.

00:22:22.418 --> 00:22:24.336
I was his weapon in the conquest

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.880
that built Asgard's empire.

00:22:29.758 --> 00:22:33.053
One by one, the
realms became ours.

00:22:33.304 --> 00:22:37.391
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

00:22:37.683 --> 00:22:42.229
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

00:22:42.604 --> 00:22:45.274
Before that, Asgard's
warriors were honored...

00:22:45.566 --> 00:22:49.069
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

00:23:00.331 --> 00:23:02.265
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.

00:23:04.293 --> 00:23:06.712
Most of the stuff
in here is fake.

00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:08.505
Or weak.

00:23:10.716 --> 00:23:12.593
Smaller than I
thought it would be.

00:23:13.761 --> 00:23:15.262
That's not bad.

00:23:15.346 --> 00:23:17.014
But this...

00:23:17.723 --> 00:23:19.725
The Eternal Flame.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.339
Want to see what true
power really looks like?

00:24:19.201 --> 00:24:21.787
Fenris, my darling, what
have they done to you?

00:24:24.331 --> 00:24:28.335
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn.

00:24:44.017 --> 00:24:45.811
I've missed you.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.564
I've missed you all.

00:25:15.488 --> 00:25:17.008
You know, where I'm from...

00:25:17.968 --> 00:25:20.048
when black folks
started revolutions,

00:25:20.168 --> 00:25:21.928
they never had the firepower...

00:25:22.048 --> 00:25:24.128
or the resources to
fight their oppressors.

00:25:24.768 --> 00:25:26.408
Where was Wakanda?

00:25:28.968 --> 00:25:29.968
Hmm?

00:25:32.528 --> 00:25:34.248
Yeah, all that ends today.

00:25:34.408 --> 00:25:37.528
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.

00:25:37.688 --> 00:25:39.408
Already in place.

00:25:39.568 --> 00:25:40.928
I know how colonizers think.

00:25:41.088 --> 00:25:43.608
So we're gonna use their
own strategy against 'em.

00:25:44.608 --> 00:25:47.488
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.

00:25:47.648 --> 00:25:50.368
They'll arm oppressed
people all over the world...

00:25:50.528 --> 00:25:52.968
so they can finally rise
up and kill those in power.

00:25:53.128 --> 00:25:54.808
And their children.

00:25:54.888 --> 00:25:56.688
And anyone else
who takes their side.

00:25:56.848 --> 00:25:59.288
It's time they know
the truth about us!

00:25:59.488 --> 00:26:01.088
We're warriors!

00:26:01.248 --> 00:26:04.368
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.

00:26:05.928 --> 00:26:09.328
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

00:26:10.048 --> 00:26:12.728
Wakanda has
survived for so long...

00:26:12.888 --> 00:26:16.208
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

00:26:16.368 --> 00:26:19.008
Wakanda survived in
the past this way, yes.

00:26:20.528 --> 00:26:22.728
But the world is
changing, General.

00:26:23.488 --> 00:26:26.928
Elders, it is getting smaller.

00:26:27.088 --> 00:26:28.968
The outside world
is catching up...

00:26:29.128 --> 00:26:31.128
and soon it will
be the conquerors

00:26:31.208 --> 00:26:33.288
or the conquered.

00:26:35.248 --> 00:26:36.928
I'd rather be the former.

00:26:39.128 --> 00:26:41.968
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

00:26:43.528 --> 00:26:44.728
<i>So where are we going again?</i>

00:26:44.888 --> 00:26:46.488
<i>We're taking the
Heart-Shaped Herb</i>

00:26:46.608 --> 00:26:47.568
<i>to Jabariland.</i>

00:26:47.728 --> 00:26:49.368
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?

00:26:49.528 --> 00:26:51.928
It gives whoever takes
it heightened abilities.

00:26:52.088 --> 00:26:54.688
It's what made
T'Challa so strong.

00:26:55.248 --> 00:26:56.288
Nakia.

00:27:00.648 --> 00:27:02.528
I don't like this.

00:27:02.688 --> 00:27:04.448
The Herb belongs to us.

00:27:04.608 --> 00:27:07.808
We may be creating a
bigger monster with M'Baku.

00:27:13.928 --> 00:27:17.688
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.

00:27:18.248 --> 00:27:21.688
I am a spy with no army.

00:27:23.048 --> 00:27:24.808
I wouldn't stand a chance.

00:27:26.568 --> 00:27:28.048
We'll go.

00:27:34.688 --> 00:27:35.968
Oh, boy.

00:27:41.288 --> 00:27:42.608
Oh, shit.

00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:45.608
Look down. Stay calm.

00:27:45.768 --> 00:27:46.768
Shuri.

00:27:48.088 --> 00:27:49.488
Look down.

00:28:08.668 --> 00:28:10.548
This is mutiny!

00:28:11.348 --> 00:28:13.628
This is mutiny!

00:28:13.788 --> 00:28:16.388
This is mutiny!

00:28:28.148 --> 00:28:29.548
You're scum!

00:28:33.188 --> 00:28:34.468
Oh!

00:29:05.188 --> 00:29:06.188
Captain!

00:29:06.348 --> 00:29:08.868
Help me! Please!

00:29:09.028 --> 00:29:10.588
Captain!

00:29:13.868 --> 00:29:15.628
You're the one what
killed those men...

00:29:16.108 --> 00:29:17.948
by leading them
down the wrong path.

00:29:18.868 --> 00:29:20.588
Because you're weak.

00:29:22.948 --> 00:29:24.548
And stupid!

00:29:26.588 --> 00:29:28.628
It's time for the Ravagers...

00:29:28.708 --> 00:29:32.548
to rise once again to
glory with a new captain...

00:29:33.308 --> 00:29:34.948
Taserface!

00:29:42.628 --> 00:29:46.308
I'm sorry. Your name is...

00:29:46.468 --> 00:29:48.148
It's Taserface?

00:29:48.588 --> 00:29:49.908
That's right.

00:29:50.268 --> 00:29:52.628
Do you shoot tasers
out of your face?

00:29:53.268 --> 00:29:55.148
It's metaphorical!

00:29:55.308 --> 00:29:56.308
Yeah!

00:29:59.748 --> 00:30:00.748
For what?

00:30:03.108 --> 00:30:05.788
For it is a name
what strikes fear...

00:30:05.828 --> 00:30:08.668
into the hearts of
anyone what hears it.

00:30:11.308 --> 00:30:12.588
Okay.

00:30:13.148 --> 00:30:14.348
Okay...

00:30:14.508 --> 00:30:15.788
whatever you say.

00:30:16.308 --> 00:30:17.508
You shut up.

00:30:17.668 --> 00:30:18.988
You're next.

00:30:19.308 --> 00:30:23.348
Udonta, I have waited
a long time to do...

00:30:23.428 --> 00:30:24.428
What?

00:30:25.668 --> 00:30:28.548
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

00:30:28.708 --> 00:30:31.708
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...

00:30:31.908 --> 00:30:32.908
looking in the mirror

00:30:32.988 --> 00:30:35.028
and then in all seriousness
saying to yourself...

00:30:35.068 --> 00:30:37.628
"You know what would
be a really kick-ass name?"

00:30:37.748 --> 00:30:40.188
"Taserface!"

00:30:41.108 --> 00:30:43.108
That's how I hear
you in my head!

00:30:44.628 --> 00:30:46.748
What was your second choice?

00:30:46.908 --> 00:30:48.028
Scrotum Hat?

00:30:51.108 --> 00:30:53.708
New plan.
We're killing you first.

00:30:55.108 --> 00:30:56.668
Well, dying is certainly better

00:30:56.788 --> 00:30:58.308
than having to
live an entire life...

00:30:58.388 --> 00:31:02.308
as a moronic shitbag who
thinks Taserface is a cool name.

00:31:02.468 --> 00:31:05.388
That's enough killing for today.

00:31:09.348 --> 00:31:10.988
She's the daughter of Thanos.

00:31:13.228 --> 00:31:15.468
I thought you were the
biggest sadist in the galaxy.

00:31:15.548 --> 00:31:18.388
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

00:31:18.548 --> 00:31:22.148
The Priestess wants
to kill the fox herself.

00:31:22.308 --> 00:31:25.268
And he has bounties on his
head in at least 12 Kree provinces.

00:31:26.948 --> 00:31:28.348
I assure you...

00:31:28.548 --> 00:31:31.308
I am not as easy a mark as an
old man without his magic stick...

00:31:31.508 --> 00:31:33.388
or a talking woodland beast.

00:31:34.748 --> 00:31:36.668
I want 10% of the take...

00:31:38.308 --> 00:31:40.028
and a couple more things.

00:31:41.868 --> 00:31:43.468
We got a whole box of hands...

00:31:43.628 --> 00:31:45.588
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.

00:31:45.628 --> 00:31:48.988
You think them Kree is
gonna execute the captain?

00:31:49.068 --> 00:31:53.268
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

00:31:53.428 --> 00:31:56.868
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

00:31:57.028 --> 00:31:58.788
Location of Ego's
planet in the nav.

00:31:58.868 --> 00:32:01.148
We'll wire you the
10% once we's paid.

00:32:01.308 --> 00:32:03.508
What are you gonna
do with your share?

00:32:04.388 --> 00:32:06.708
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

00:32:06.788 --> 00:32:08.628
battle one another in training.

00:32:09.388 --> 00:32:11.668
Every time my
sister prevailed...

00:32:11.828 --> 00:32:15.148
my father would replace a
piece of me with machinery...

00:32:15.308 --> 00:32:17.988
claiming he wanted
me to be her equal.

00:32:19.108 --> 00:32:20.948
But she won...

00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:25.948
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

00:32:27.548 --> 00:32:29.948
So after I murder my sister...

00:32:30.108 --> 00:32:31.228
I will buy a warship

00:32:31.308 --> 00:32:33.308
with every conceivable
instrument of death.

00:32:33.468 --> 00:32:35.308
I will hunt my
father like a dog,

00:32:35.348 --> 00:32:37.108
and I will tear
him apart slowly...

00:32:37.268 --> 00:32:38.828
piece by piece...

00:32:38.868 --> 00:32:42.348
until he knows some semblance of
the profound and unceasing pain...

00:32:42.428 --> 00:32:45.628
I know every single day.

00:32:47.388 --> 00:32:48.748
Yeah.

00:32:49.228 --> 00:32:51.028
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

00:32:51.828 --> 00:32:53.708
Or a nice hat.

00:32:53.868 --> 00:32:56.708
Something to make the other
girls go, "Ooh, that's nice!"

00:33:00.548 --> 00:33:03.748
Anyways, happy trails.

00:33:10.571 --> 00:33:12.489
What is that noise?

00:33:12.739 --> 00:33:15.409
The common folk aren't
exactly falling in line.

00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:19.496
There's a resistance trying
to knock down the front gates.

00:33:25.043 --> 00:33:26.795
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

00:33:27.296 --> 00:33:29.506
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...

00:33:29.756 --> 00:33:31.675
Right, yeah, I'll
just stop you there.

00:33:31.758 --> 00:33:33.510
What I meant was...

00:33:34.011 --> 00:33:35.304
what's your ambition?

00:33:36.597 --> 00:33:39.850
I just want a chance
to prove myself.

00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:41.602
Recognition.

00:33:41.977 --> 00:33:43.228
When I was young...

00:33:43.645 --> 00:33:47.149
every great king
had an executioner.

00:33:47.441 --> 00:33:49.359
Not just to execute people...

00:33:49.651 --> 00:33:52.112
but also to
execute their vision.

00:33:53.238 --> 00:33:55.907
But mainly to execute people.

00:33:56.199 --> 00:33:58.118
Still, it was a great honor.

00:34:00.078 --> 00:34:02.664
I was Odin's executioner.

00:34:03.957 --> 00:34:08.045
And you shall be my executioner.

00:34:13.675 --> 00:34:15.552
Let's begin our conquest.

00:34:27.064 --> 00:34:28.482
Skurge, where's the sword?

00:34:33.904 --> 00:34:37.616
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.576
Those people you mentioned,

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.662
the ones who aren't
falling into line...

00:34:42.329 --> 00:34:43.413
round them up.

00:35:07.354 --> 00:35:08.772
Excuse me.

00:35:20.867 --> 00:35:22.285
Sorry about that.

00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:23.662
These bloody things
are everywhere.

00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:26.123
Come on.

00:36:01.074 --> 00:36:02.659
You'll be safe here.

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:22.236
We deliver you to the
Kree in the morning.

00:36:24.476 --> 00:36:27.676
Neither one of you will
last much longer after that.

00:36:28.276 --> 00:36:30.316
Okay, Taserface.

00:36:30.996 --> 00:36:33.076
Hey, tell the other
guys we said...

00:36:33.236 --> 00:36:34.716
"Hi," Taserface!

00:36:39.876 --> 00:36:42.636
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

00:36:42.676 --> 00:36:44.156
No, Gef.

00:36:44.236 --> 00:36:45.916
It's too adorable to kill.

00:36:46.076 --> 00:36:47.956
Take it to the tailor.

00:36:49.476 --> 00:36:52.836
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

00:36:55.196 --> 00:36:59.996
I was a Kree battle slave for
20 years when Stakar freed me.

00:37:02.556 --> 00:37:05.196
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:09.836
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

00:37:09.996 --> 00:37:11.756
But I was young...

00:37:12.716 --> 00:37:16.156
and greedy, and stupid.

00:37:17.156 --> 00:37:19.276
Like you stealing
those batteries.

00:37:19.436 --> 00:37:20.996
That was mostly Drax.

00:37:22.396 --> 00:37:25.916
Me and Stakar and
the other captains...

00:37:26.876 --> 00:37:29.276
we weren't so different
from you and your friends.

00:37:30.196 --> 00:37:32.116
The only family I ever had.

00:37:33.516 --> 00:37:35.196
When I broke the code...

00:37:37.436 --> 00:37:39.116
they exiled me.

00:37:40.396 --> 00:37:41.916
This is what I deserve.

00:37:42.076 --> 00:37:43.876
Slow down, drama queen.

00:37:43.956 --> 00:37:45.676
You might deserve
this, but I don't.

00:37:45.756 --> 00:37:47.516
We gotta get outta here.

00:37:49.036 --> 00:37:50.196
Where's Quill?

00:37:50.356 --> 00:37:51.996
He went off with his old man.

00:37:53.596 --> 00:37:55.196
Ego? Yeah.

00:37:55.356 --> 00:37:57.516
It's a day for dumbass names.

00:38:00.556 --> 00:38:03.036
You're smiling. And for a
second, I got a warm feeling.

00:38:03.076 --> 00:38:05.876
But then it was ruined by
those disgusting-ass teeth.

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:08.356
You like a professional
asshole or what?

00:38:08.516 --> 00:38:09.556
Pretty much a pro.

00:38:09.596 --> 00:38:12.436
Why didn't you deliver Quill
to Ego like you promised?

00:38:13.036 --> 00:38:14.716
He was skinny.

00:38:15.076 --> 00:38:19.276
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.

00:38:19.716 --> 00:38:20.716
Uh-huh.

00:38:24.236 --> 00:38:27.396
I got an idea on
how to get outta here.

00:38:28.276 --> 00:38:30.796
But we're gonna
need your little friend.

00:38:31.956 --> 00:38:34.396
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

00:38:45.476 --> 00:38:47.756
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

00:38:53.876 --> 00:38:56.596
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

00:38:56.756 --> 00:38:58.596
He's goddang precious!

00:39:11.396 --> 00:39:12.396
Psst!

00:39:12.676 --> 00:39:14.396
Hey, twig!

00:39:14.756 --> 00:39:16.156
Come here.

00:39:16.636 --> 00:39:17.796
Come on.

00:39:24.436 --> 00:39:25.436
Aw, man...

00:39:25.476 --> 00:39:27.076
what did they do to you?

00:39:30.156 --> 00:39:32.636
Hey, you wanna
help us get outta here?

00:39:33.436 --> 00:39:36.596
There's something I need you
to get, and bring back to me.

00:39:36.756 --> 00:39:40.876
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

00:39:41.036 --> 00:39:42.636
the thing I wore on my head.

00:39:43.316 --> 00:39:47.436
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

00:39:47.596 --> 00:39:48.876
You got it?

00:40:22.516 --> 00:40:24.036
That's my underwears.

00:40:24.076 --> 00:40:26.356
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't
know what you were talkin' about.

00:40:26.396 --> 00:40:28.516
You have to explain
it more careful.

00:40:30.036 --> 00:40:33.476
It's a prototype fin.

00:40:38.916 --> 00:40:41.716
That's an orloni.
It's a fin, Groot.

00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:43.556
You explain it this time.

00:40:44.716 --> 00:40:46.196
All right.

00:40:46.916 --> 00:40:48.836
That's Vorker's eye.

00:40:48.996 --> 00:40:51.076
He takes it out when he sleeps.

00:40:51.196 --> 00:40:52.516
Go. Look again.

00:40:52.676 --> 00:40:54.036
But leave the eye here.

00:40:54.556 --> 00:40:55.636
Why?

00:40:55.716 --> 00:40:57.196
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

00:40:57.236 --> 00:40:59.556
and he's not gonna know...

00:40:59.716 --> 00:41:02.036
where his eye is!

00:41:08.236 --> 00:41:09.756
That's a desk.

00:41:09.956 --> 00:41:12.756
We told you it was this big.

00:41:18.636 --> 00:41:20.916
Tell me you guys have a
refrigerator somewhere...

00:41:20.956 --> 00:41:23.716
with a bunch of
severed human toes.

00:41:23.876 --> 00:41:27.596
Okay. Then let's just
agree to never discuss this.

00:41:30.756 --> 00:41:34.396
The drawer you wanna
open has this symbol on it.

00:41:34.556 --> 00:41:35.916
Okay?

00:41:44.436 --> 00:41:46.316
What? No!

00:41:46.476 --> 00:41:47.756
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

00:41:47.916 --> 00:41:49.196
That's not what I said!

00:41:49.276 --> 00:41:50.276
I am Groot.

00:41:50.316 --> 00:41:51.476
He's relieved you
don't want him to.

00:41:51.556 --> 00:41:52.996
I am Groot. He hates hats.

00:41:53.116 --> 00:41:54.116
I am Groot.

00:41:54.156 --> 00:41:55.236
On anyone, not just himself.

00:41:55.276 --> 00:41:56.316
I am Groot.

00:41:56.396 --> 00:41:58.316
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

00:41:58.396 --> 00:41:59.436
the next minute
it's just because

00:41:59.476 --> 00:42:00.876
you realize part of
that head is the hat.

00:42:01.276 --> 00:42:02.636
That's why you don't like hats?

00:42:03.756 --> 00:42:06.116
This is an important
conversation right now?

00:42:42.836 --> 00:42:43.876
That ain't it.

00:42:53.676 --> 00:42:55.156
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

00:42:58.156 --> 00:42:59.996
They killed all my friends.

00:43:03.996 --> 00:43:06.636
Get the third quadrant
ready for release.

00:43:13.196 --> 00:43:14.196
One more thing.

00:43:16.076 --> 00:43:18.516
You got any clones of
Quill's old music on the ship?

00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:02.916
Ah.

00:44:08.396 --> 00:44:10.276
He's got it!

00:44:10.476 --> 00:44:11.956
<i>Yondu's got the fin!</i>

00:44:12.076 --> 00:44:13.076
Go!

00:44:54.476 --> 00:44:55.476
Down there!

00:45:19.196 --> 00:45:20.796
Oh!

00:46:54.236 --> 00:46:55.716
You maniac.

00:46:57.596 --> 00:46:59.916
The whole ship's gonna blow.

00:47:09.756 --> 00:47:11.356
Not the whole ship.

00:47:28.396 --> 00:47:29.436
<i>Who is this?</i>

00:47:29.596 --> 00:47:33.916
I am sending you the
coordinates for Yondu's ship.

00:47:34.356 --> 00:47:36.116
Release the quadrant!
Aye, Captain!

00:47:36.276 --> 00:47:38.796
I only ask one thing.

00:47:39.276 --> 00:47:40.956
That your High Priestess...

00:47:41.116 --> 00:47:44.716
tell him the name of the
man what sealed his fate.

00:47:45.636 --> 00:47:47.716
Taserface!

00:48:11.156 --> 00:48:12.396
Where to, Captain?

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:13.596
Ego.

00:48:15.156 --> 00:48:16.396
No, boy!

00:48:24.116 --> 00:48:26.356
It ain't healthy for
a mammalian body

00:48:26.476 --> 00:48:28.676
to hop more than
50 jumps at a time.

00:48:28.836 --> 00:48:29.876
I know that.

00:48:29.956 --> 00:48:32.476
We are about to do 700!

00:49:19.561 --> 00:49:20.881
My son...

00:49:22.881 --> 00:49:25.521
was murdered in ritual combat.

00:49:26.001 --> 00:49:28.161
- Were the odds fair?
- Yes, but...

00:49:28.321 --> 00:49:29.921
So it was less a
murder than a defeat.

00:49:30.081 --> 00:49:31.961
- Do not rub our noses in it!
- Silence!

00:49:33.121 --> 00:49:35.721
I make the
pronouncements here, girl.

00:49:35.881 --> 00:49:38.561
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...

00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:42.561
The new king...

00:49:50.361 --> 00:49:52.561
You cannot talk!

00:49:52.721 --> 00:49:54.121
One more word,

00:49:54.201 --> 00:49:56.441
and I will feed
you to my children.

00:50:00.601 --> 00:50:02.841
I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.

00:50:10.121 --> 00:50:13.321
Great Gorilla M'Baku...

00:50:15.841 --> 00:50:19.121
this is why we are here.

00:50:19.921 --> 00:50:22.081
To offer this to you.

00:50:22.881 --> 00:50:25.281
An outsider sits on our throne.

00:50:25.441 --> 00:50:27.241
Only you can help us stop him.

00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:46.121
Come with me.

00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:04.521
Impossible!

00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:11.441
Is he breathing?

00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:14.361
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.

00:51:14.721 --> 00:51:16.401
<i>One of our fishermen found him</i>

00:51:16.481 --> 00:51:18.121
<i>at the edge of the river border.</i>

00:51:18.281 --> 00:51:19.561
<i>He brought him to me.</i>

00:51:19.721 --> 00:51:21.481
Why do you have him in the snow?

00:51:21.641 --> 00:51:22.801
It is the only thing keeping him

00:51:22.921 --> 00:51:23.961
from joining the ancestors.

00:51:24.121 --> 00:51:26.641
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

00:51:26.841 --> 00:51:28.361
Take him. He'll be
dead in seconds.

00:51:30.081 --> 00:51:31.721
Nakia, the Herb.

00:51:48.641 --> 00:51:50.601
I call upon the ancestors.

00:51:51.001 --> 00:51:52.961
I call upon Bast.

00:51:53.481 --> 00:51:56.441
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

00:51:57.481 --> 00:51:58.961
Heal him.

00:52:10.881 --> 00:52:13.841
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:15.241
Okay.

00:52:35.681 --> 00:52:37.401
Wake up, T'Challa.

00:52:50.241 --> 00:52:53.121
The time has come
for you to come home...

00:52:53.281 --> 00:52:55.721
and be reunited with me.

00:53:06.681 --> 00:53:08.081
<i>Why?</i>

00:53:10.241 --> 00:53:13.321
Why didn't you
bring the boy home?

00:53:15.041 --> 00:53:16.561
Why, <i>Baba?</i>

00:53:18.401 --> 00:53:19.601
He...

00:53:20.561 --> 00:53:23.841
He was the truth
I chose to omit.

00:53:25.001 --> 00:53:27.601
You were wrong to abandon him.

00:53:27.761 --> 00:53:29.641
I chose my people.

00:53:30.481 --> 00:53:33.041
I chose Wakanda.

00:53:33.201 --> 00:53:35.081
Our future depended...

00:53:35.241 --> 00:53:36.801
You were wrong!

00:53:36.961 --> 00:53:39.201
All of you were wrong!

00:53:40.241 --> 00:53:43.161
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

00:53:45.521 --> 00:53:47.441
We let the fear of our discovery

00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:50.081
stop us from
doing what is right!

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:52.521
No more!

00:53:56.321 --> 00:54:00.081
I cannot stay here with you.

00:54:01.841 --> 00:54:06.121
I cannot rest while
he sits on the throne.

00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:09.641
He is a monster
of our own making.

00:54:11.321 --> 00:54:14.641
I must take the
mantle back. I must!

00:54:16.721 --> 00:54:19.361
I must right these wrongs.
