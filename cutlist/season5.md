## Avengers: Infinity War
- Music cue after Banner arrives on Earth ("Thanos is coming") is changed to better transition to intro
- As Banner calls Cap after the New York attack, music is changed and cell phone sound effects added
- Establishing shot from the first GotG movie added to cut back to Thor and the Guardians after a long break, along with a short reprise of the GotG theme
- Post-credits scene from Black Panther of Bucky in Wakanda is added as a cold open
- Flashback of Gamora and Thanos and the Guardians visiting Knowhere is pushed back to later episode
- Final shot of Knowhere in flames is slowed down slightly to crossfade to different scene

- Post-credits of Fury getting snapped moved to just before Endgame

## Ant-Man and the Wasp
- First four minutes of Hank Pym recapping the first film and how Janet was trapped in the Quantum Realm are cut
- When Scott and Cassie talk about the "World's Greatest Grandma" trophy she gave him, Cassie's line, "it was the only one they had" is cut because it's funnier if she specifically chose it
- Cut about four seconds from the cut-to-black when Hope kidnaps Scott to improve pacing in new structure
- Slowed down establishing shot before meeting with Sonny Burch and added voice line from Hope to re-establish what's going on
- Replaced music in final shot of them watching the movie on a laptop
- Post-credits of Scott being trapped in Quantum Realm moved to just before Endgame
- Removed post-credits of ant playing on drums since it felt really silly to include it anywhere after the snap

## Captain Marvel
- Several music tracks are changed to better fit Carol's emotional arc. Specific track changes are listed further in the cutlist.
- Opening dream sequence removed
- Film now begins with Carol landing on Earth, with the first twenty minutes of the film shown later in a flashback. This is done to better tie into the other MCU films by introducing the plot with a pre-established character (Nick Fury).
- Carol crash-landing into the Blockbuster is heavily edited to remove the music, removing several shots to make the sequence more disorienting, and various sound effects are added
- Establishing shot of Blockbuster has "Planet C-53" text removed, and 1995 text added instead
- Sequence of Skrulls arriving on beach and shapeshifting into surfers is removed so that the Skrulls are revealed when the characters meet them
- Sequence of Carol contacting Yon-Rogg in the phone booth is heavily altered to keep the narrative focused on Nick Fury's perspective. Yon-Rogg is no longer shown and Carol is unable to reach him.
- "Only Happy When It Rains" changed to "Tom's Diner" by Suzanne Vega, along with new motorcycle sound effects, as Carol arrives at the diner
- After Nick Fury asks Carol to "prove [she's] not a Skrull," cuts to Carol back on Hala
- Deleted scene with Carol and Yon-Rogg teaching children on Hala is added back in, with finished VFX
- When Yon-Rogg trains with Carol, cut all dialog about Carol having dreams, so that his advice is purely focused on Carol controlling her emotions and not worrying about her past
- Removed Carol hitting Yon-Rogg with her beam to better establish that she really is holding herself back and so her power feels more "earned" later
- Carol's flashback as the Skrulls probe her mind is heavily altered to avoid showing too much of her life as an pilot. Talos' dialog is re-ordered to fit the new sequence
- A new sequence is inserted into the mind-probing scene showing Carol watching Happy Days with her family. Giving Carol a happier childhood memory makes it more worthwhile for Carol to fight to be human again, and also sets up the use of the Happy Days theme later in the film. The sequence is cobbled together using footage of McKenna Grace in Designated Survivor (S1E15) and a retro TV shot from Troop Zero with footage from Happy Days (S5E22, the one with Mork) superimposed onto it.
- As Carol retrieves her boots while fighting the Skrulls, removed short sequence where she shoots a monitor showing her memory of a misogynistic fighter pilot, as this memory was also removed from the mind-probing sequence
- As Carol is shown crash-landing at the Blockbuster a second time, slightly shortened and cuts back to Nick Fury at the diner
- Adjusted Carol shooting the jukebox and Fury asking, "How is that supposed to prove you're not a Skrull?" to imply he was referring to the flashback, and Carol shoots the jukebox after his question
- Added music slowing down and stopping after Carol shoots the jukebox
- "Waterfalls" changed to "Surf Rider" as Carol and Fury travel to the Pegasus facility
- As Carol has a flashback seeing a photo of herself as a pilot, sequence extended with shots previously cut from mind-probing sequence
- Carol demanding Nick Fury hand over his pager is cut since he's supposed to have earned her trust by this point. Plus, it seems inconsistent with Fury's character for him to comply, and it makes Carol seem like a dick.
- Establishing shot on Maria's house slowed down slightly to crossfade with previous scene
- "Come As You Are" changed to "Take My Breath Away" as Carol meets with the Supreme Intelligence aboard Dr. Lawson's ship. It's not only a relevant homage to Top Gun, but is also great as a sarcastic theme for the scene
- "Just a Girl" changed to the theme song from "Happy Days" as Carol fights the Kree aboard the ship. Carol never emotionally connected with the No Doubt song and was banking on 90s nostalgia from the audience. Happy Days connects to Carol's childhood and is about going back to better days, parallel to Carol rejecting her Kree life in favor of her nostalgic Earth life. There's also several other elements tying Carol to Happy Days already in the film -- the lunchbox, Carol's leather jacket/motorcycle, and hitting jukeboxes multiple times (including at the beginning of the fight sequence).
- "1979" by the Smashing Pumpkins added to final dinner scene, again using a 90s song about nostalgia to establish Carol returning to happier times
- Post-credits of present-day Carol looking for Fury moved to just before Endgame
- "Please Mr. Postman" added quietly to post-credits scene of the Flurken coughing up the Tesseract

## Avengers: Endgame
- Cold open with Hawkeye moved back to later episode and replaced with post-credit scenes from Ant-Man and the Wasp, Infinity War, and Captain Marvel
- "Natasha's Lullaby" from the Black Widow OST played over episode credits after Natasha's death
- Post-credits scene from Black Widow of Yelena visiting Natasha's grave inserted after Tony's funeral, minus the bit with Contessa Valentina
- Added behind-the-scenes montage after the final credits to serve as a sendoff for the series, a la Deadpool & Wolverine. Set to "I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song" by Jim Croce.
