# Season 2 Cutlist

## Overall Changes
- 4 movies are cut into 8 hour-long episodes.
- All original title cards and credits are removed.
- Each episode begins with a "ducko" logo, a cold open sequence, and the Phase 2 Marvel Studios logo as an intro.
- Each episode ends with a "Marvel Unite" titlecard and custom abbreviated credits.
- Post-credit scenes that are critical to the plot are always inserted before any end credits.

## Captain America: The Winter Soldier
- Audio reconstructed when Black Widow drives off after "Can't run everywhere" so the scene can cut to black. 
- Restored deleted scene of SHIELD searching for Captain America in a gym to serve as a cold open for an episode, AI upscaled to 4K.
- Some shots of STRIKE helicarriers taking off are shuffled so that it works as an opening scene.
- To fix continuity, a few shots are removed and reordered when STRIKE starts targeting people. The computers were shown to be targeting Tony Stark and the President of the United States, whom are both featured in the same episode in a different location in scenes from Iron Man 3.
- The post credits sequence with Bucky at the museum will be featured in a later episode in Season 3.

## Iron Man 3
- The opening flashback in Bern is pushed back to a later episode, so that Cap's "On your left" could stand alone as a much better season opener.
- Almost all of Tony's voiceover was removed, as it was too jarring in this episodic format. Some shots are removed to fix pacing in areas where voice over was cut.
- Establishing shot of Tony's house is zoomed and cropped to remove "Present Day, Malibu, California" text, replaced with just "Malibu, California".
- When Iron Man flies away after his anxiety attack, screen wipe is recomposited to transition to Captain America.
- Happy reminding employees about their name badges has its audio reworked so that it overlaps the previous scene.
- After Tony crash lands in Tennessee, a wide shot of Tony in the snow is reused with a slight digital zoomout to more smoothly end the episode on a cliffhanger.
- Instead of Tony leaving a phone call to Pepper, towing his broken suit to the garage, and then cutting to Pepper finding Tony's message, we instead start with Pepper finding his message, then transition to hearing his phone call as voice-over while he tows his suit and calls her.
- When trying to rescue the President from Air Force One, Tony leaves the boat later than originally to fix some pacing issues.
- An exterior shot of the oil rig is reversed so that the camera dollies in rather than out to better illustrate the change of location.
- The scene where Maya reveals to Pepper that her boss works for the Mandarin is moved a few scenes later so that it creates tension at the end of an episode.
- A short sequence where one of Tony's suits takes out a couple of minions on a catwalk is removed so that the scene could break there.
- A short sequence where Tony lands as the oil derrick collapses is removed for pacing.
- At the end of the film, Tony's voice-over is necessary to convey some critical information, so some of the removed voice-over from earlier in the film is placed here to help establish the voice-over, along with the film's opening shot of the iron suits exploding.
- Post credits scene with Bruce Banner acting as Tony's impromptu therapist is cut, as there wasn't anywhere to put this scene without undercutting tension.

## Thor: The Dark World
- The opening long-winded exposition about the history of dark elves was cut and will be missed by nobody.
- Love triangle with Thor and Sif is cut out entirely, as it has no payoff and is generally disliked. Scene where Sif invites Thor to dinner is replaced with a deleted scene (AI upscaled to 4K) of Thor not throwing his mug, which is a nicer, more subtle way of showing that he longs for Earth life.
- Jane's phone call to Erik Selvig and the cutaway to him at Stonehenge is cut so that Erik can be introduced in a later episode when he is relevant to the plot. The Stonehenge scene is repeated later anyway when Darcy sees him on TV.
- Malekith is not introduced until after Jane goes to Asgard and learns about the existence of the dark elves, and one unnecessary scene with Malekith and Kurse. A later scene between them has the foreign subtitles slightly adjusted to make up for the missing scene. Many shots are shortened and a few are removed during this sequence to fit the new pacing.
- Scenes where Darcy and Ian find Erik are moved back for pacing.
- While Jane and Frigga are speaking to Odin, shots of Sif giving Jane a jealous stare are removed. An extra shot of Asgardiain soldiers marching is inserted from a later scene.
- The scene where Erik explains that they need to go to Greenwich has some driving music added to better match the energy of surrounding scenes. An unused track from the OST is added.
- An establishing shot of a tower in Greenwich is slowed down to better illustrate the change of location.
- Post credits scene with Thor returning to Jane is cut. Considering they are broken up for Thor: Ragnarok and Jane will not appear again for the rest of this series, I think it's better to leave their relationship unresolved/ambiguous.

## Avengers: Age of Ultron
- Post-credits scene from Captain America is used to directly set up the beginning of this film.
- When Natasha flirts with Bruce at the party, and again at Hawkeye's house, a total of about 40 seconds are removed to try to strip out some of the awkward sexual tension from these scenes. Their romantic relationship doesn't really go anywhere in future films, but is still necessary to set up Hulk flying away in the Quinjet.
- The post-credits scene with Thanos saying "Fine, I'll do it myself" is removed, and is instead at the end of Season 3 so that it takes place after the events of Guardians of the Galaxy. In its place, the season ends with the scene from Thor: The Dark World where the Aether is delivered to the Collector.
