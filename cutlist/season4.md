## Black Panther
- Opening narration about the history of Wakanda is cut so it remains more mysterious
- The 90's Oakland scene at the beginning is moved way later to when Zuri reveals to T'Challa what happened
- T'Challa talking to Okoye in the ship before retrieving Nakia from Nigeria is cut to make Black Panther's first appearance more impactful
- Killmonger's intro scene at the British museum is moved to a later episode to when his character becomes relevant
- Establishing shot of Wakanda before T'Challa/Nakia street scene slightly stretched
- Removed Shuri showing T'Challa the shoes she developed to omit awful "what are those" bit
- Killmonger shooting Klaue is moved slightly earlier to serve as an episode ending
- Cut Shuri's line, "Another broken white boy for us to fix," because she's presumably referring to Bucky Barnes, and this edit holds off on revealing Bucky in Wakanda until a much later episode

- Different music cue added to beginning of T'Challa/Killmonger fight for better transition
- Short recap added of T'Challa being thrown off the cliff since a couple episodes passed

- A few shots of Ross flying the ship are cut for a better transition point

- Beginning of the Red Room sequence is heavily altered. Footage from a deleted scene is added to focus less on "Melina" and give the sequence some breathing room. Additionally, we find out that Melina and Natasha have swapped identities from Alexei's perspective instead of Dreykov's, which gives more emotional weight when Alexei thinks he is talking to Natasha and makes for a more interesting reveal.
